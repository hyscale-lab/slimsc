Okay, so I have this question about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I remember correctly, occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror images. Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The structure sounds complicated, but I think I can break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups on each benzene ring and carboxylate groups as well. But wait, the carboxylate is part of the ester group here. So the molecule is an ester with two ester groups on each benzene.

I'm trying to visualize this. The biphenyl structure can have rotation about the central bond. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then no optical isomerism. But if the arrangement leads to no plane of symmetry, maybe it can have isomerism.

Wait, but for biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center, then they can exhibit optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central axis that's a point of symmetry. Let me think: the two benzene rings are connected. Each has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group. The nitro groups are at 6,6', and the carboxylates at 2,2' positions. Wait, so each benzene ring has two substituents: one nitro, one ester.

Wait, maybe each benzene ring is para-substituted? Because 2 and 6 are meta positions on a benzene ring, but wait, the numbering. Wait, benzene has six positions. If the substituents are at 2 and 6, that would be adjacent perhaps? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Let's think: in biphenyl, each ring is numbered from their respective positions. So the 1,1' position is where the two benzene rings are connected.

Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the connection is between C1 of each benzene. Then, substituents at 6 and 2 on each ring. So for each ring, substituents at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but that would make them para to each other? Because on a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other if the connection is at position 1. So for each ring, substituents at 2 and 6 are para. But in biphenyl, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate ester. So each ring is 2-nitro-6-carboxy (as an ester) or something like that? Wait, maybe each ring has a nitro group and a ester group at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro group at 6. Similarly, 2,2' are the carboxylate groups. So each ring has substituents at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). So each ring is 2-carboxylate,6-nitro.

Wait, then looking at the biphenyl system, each ring is substituted at 2 and 6. Now, the question is whether this creates any chiral centers. Wait, but the biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center. Unless the substituents cause the molecule as a whole to lack a plane of symmetry, leading to internal planes that would allow for enantiomers.

Alternatively, maybe the central single bond allows for rotation, but if substituents are in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure with these substituents has a plane of symmetry. If both rings are identical in their substituents (each has a nitro and a carboxylate at 2 and 6), then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because looking from the center, each ring is a mirror image. So maybe the molecule as a whole is achiral, thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait: the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, but for each ring, the substituents are on opposite ends. So, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents on each ring are in a way that the whole molecule has no plane of symmetry. Hmm, this is getting complicated. I might need to think about whether this structure has any centers of chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For example, if each ring has substituents that are mirrored, the entire molecule could have a plane of symmetry. So, maybe this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should move on to the next compounds and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but the substituents would be where? The structure is CH2-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as a root. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, structure of propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH3
|
CH2-CHOH-CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH(OH)COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it's an ester, like methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2nd carbon is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the structure: the central CH2 group is connected to OH, another CH2, and the ester group (COOCH3). Wait, but the central carbon (the 2nd carbon) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two CH2 groups? Wait no, wait: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, maybe I got the structure wrong.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the three carbons are CH2-CH2-COOH. So the 2nd carbon is the middle CH2. So substituting a hydroxyl on the 2nd carbon: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. So the ester would be methyl ester: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the structure would have the central CH2 group as:

- one CH2 group from the ester (the CH2 connected to COOCH3)
- one OH group
- and another CH2 group (from CH2-OH?)

Wait, no. Let me think of it as:

The ester is OMe (OCH3). So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2 (from the COOCH3 side)
- CH2 (from the other side)
Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (position 2) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a CH2 group leading to COOCH3)
- two CH2 groups? Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

CH2(OH) – CH2 – COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be position 1 with OH, position 2 as CH2, and position 3 as COOCH3. But wait, the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which implies the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Oh wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy is on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the structure is:

- The central carbon (CH) is connected to:

   a) CH3 (from the left),
   b) OH,
   c) COOCH3 (from the right),
   d) and another H.

Wait, no, because the central carbon is CH with four substituents. So, for a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different groups attached.

In this case, the central carbon is connected to:

1. CH3 (from the left). Wait, no, the left side is CH2, so maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally. Let's see: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH2- (from the left, which is connected to another CH3)
- OH
- COOCH3 (which is a carbonyl group)
- and another CH2 group (which is connected to the COOCH3).

Wait, no. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the molecule:

The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, that can't be right because that would have the OH on the first carbon. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is actually CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH part) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another H.

Wait, but wait, that's only four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So four different groups? Hmm, yes. So that would make the central carbon a chiral center. Because each of the four substituents is different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So this molecule has a chiral center and would exhibit optical isomerism.

So compound 2 does have optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is a diketone, right? Its structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group.

Wait, so the structure is (Ph)2CO. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. So the central carbon is connected to:

- two phenyl groups,
- O (as a double bond),
- and another phenyl group? No, wait, wait. No, the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Wait, that's Ar-C(O)-Ar. So the central carbon is a carbonyl group (sp² hybridized). So the carbon is double-bonded to O, and attached to two phenyl groups and another carbon (but wait, no, in benzophenone, the carbonyl is between two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would be a single central carbon, but in reality, the structure is (Ph)₂CO, which has the central carbon connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl group. So the central carbon has three substituents: two phenyls and a double-bonded O.

Wait, but wait: the carbonyl group is double-bonded to O, so the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and the O. So in terms of geometry, the central carbon is sp² hybridized. So for a chiral center, the carbon must be sp³ hybridized and have four different substituents. Since benzophenone's central carbon is sp², it can't be a chiral center. Furthermore, the molecule is symmetrical because both substituents are phenyl groups. So it's a planar molecule with a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So compound 3 doesn't have optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. I remember that fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Wait, fumaric acid has a trans configuration in the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups (OCH3) on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is (Z)- or (E)- configuration? Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH, but wait, no, that's maleic acid. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H, with the double bond as E (trans) configuration.

So dimethyl fumarate would be MeO₂CCH=CHCO₂Me, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, looking for possible stereoisomerism.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is in the trans configuration. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So the molecule is achiral because it's symmetrical. So no chiral centers and no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps the double bond isn't in a symmetric position. Let me think again. The structure is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me? No, wait, no, it's MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    ||
C=CH
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, the structure is more like:

OCH3
|
O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O
|
OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is the trans form. So the correct structure is:

OCH3-O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O-OCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so its structure is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H, with the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Its dimethyl ester would be CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration.

So the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)-CH₂? No, wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
    ||
    CH₂-COOCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, no, in the fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on the ends of a butenedioic acid. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
    ||
    CH₂-COOCH3

Wait, but that would be for a cis configuration. For trans, the two COOCH3 groups would be on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps it would be better to think of the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-C=CH-CH₂
|
COOCH3

No, perhaps it's more accurate to imagine the structure as:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3

But that's for succinic acid. Fumarate is different; it's a substituted butenedioate.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

(CH₂COOCH3)CH=CH(CH₂COOCH3)

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think of fumarate as having two ester groups on each end of a double bond, with the double bond in the trans configuration.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂
|
COOCH3

But that's not correct either. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH₂(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)CH₂

But I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two ester groups on adjacent carbons, with a double bond in between. So the structure is:

OCH3-O-C-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-C-O-OCH3? No, that's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but that's for succinate. For fumarate, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the two middle carbons. So the four carbons are:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would be succinate.

Wait, no, for fumarate, it's:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂
|
COOCH3

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the correct structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CHCH2COOCH3, but that's not possible because the double bond would be between the two central carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me. So the structure is:

MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me, but that's again succinate. No, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible stereoisomerism. So dimethyl fumarate has a double bond. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are arranged in a way that creates stereoisomerism, perhaps it can exhibit geometric isomerism (cis-trans), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism comes from chiral centers, not from double bonds.

Wait a second—dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)CH₂. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, fumarate is the trans configuration of maleate. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂
|
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. Let me think: if the double bond is in the center, and each end has the same groups, then the molecule is symmetrical. So for dimethyl fumarate, the groups on either side of the double bond are the same (COOCH3 and CH3 groups?), so the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure of fumarate is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂
|
COOCH3

No, that can't be right because that's four carbons. Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H; its dimethyl ester is MeO₂CCH=CHCO₂Me. So that's four carbons in total: two from each ester group. So the structure is:

MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me.

Wait, no, that's succinate. Wait, no, wait, fumarate has a double bond. So the structure is:

MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me.

So the four carbons are:

MeO₂C - CH=CH - CO₂Me.

Wait, but that's only four carbons. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, the structure is:

OCH3-O-C-O-CH=CH-O-C-O-OCH3.

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, each ester group is on a CH group.

So the structure is:

OCH3 attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to a CH group that is double-bonded to another CH group, which is attached to another carbonyl group with OCH3.

So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH=CH - O-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me with a double bond, making it MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me. No, that's not right because that's butenedioate.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to think that fumarate has a double bond between the two middle carbons, each bearing a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me, but that's for succinic acid. Wait, but fumarate is a butenedioate, so the structure is MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me. So the two COOCH3 groups are on the ends of a double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂
|
COOCH3

No, wait, that's five carbons. No, it's four: each COOCH3 is on a CH, which is connected by a double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-C=CH-CH₂
|
COOCH3

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH=CH-CO₂Me. No, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the presence of chiral centers.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, if any of the carbons (like the CH groups adjacent to the double bond) have four different substituents, then they would be chiral centers.

In the structure MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH groups,
- and two Hs.

Wait, each of those CH groups would be attached to:

- a COOCH3 group,
- a double bond to the other CH,
- and two Hs.

So each of those CH groups would have substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond (which is a single substituent). So each of those would not be chiral centers because they have two Hs, so they can't have four different groups.

Wait, unless the substituents are arranged differently. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the substituents on the double bond are different, could that lead to any kind of stereoisomerism? But that's geometric isomerism (cis-trans), not optical isomerism. So optical isomerism comes from chiral centers. Since dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality. Let me think of the molecule again. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe it has a chiral center. But I'm not seeing that in the structure.

So, putting it all together:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not sure about this one. Earlier I thought it might not have a chiral center, but maybe I should reconsider. Let me think: The substituents on each benzene ring are at 2 and 6. Each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate. So each ring is 2-nitro-6-carboxylate. Wait, but in biphenyl, the central bond allows rotation, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical, then it could have a chiral center.

Wait, but no, the biphenyl rings are connected at position 1, so substituents at positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other. Wait, but for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, making each ring have substituents para to each other. But if the substituents are on both rings in a similar way, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry, creating a chiral center.

Wait, but I'm not seeing any chiral centers here. The biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center because the two rings are connected by a single bond, which can rotate. So any substituents on the rings would have to create a chiral arrangement without any symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule as a whole is achiral because the substituents on each ring are mirrored. So maybe it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, from what I've got so far:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. Yes, it has a chiral center, so yes.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but wait. For compound 4, dimethyl fumarate: I thought it doesn't have a chiral center, but wait, what if the structure is such that there's a chiral center somewhere else?

Wait, the structure is MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me. The CH groups adjacent to the double bond each have:

- MeO₂C (or COOCH3) group,
- a double bond to the other CH,
- and two Hs.

So each CH is attached to COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. So no, they're not chiral centers because they have two Hs. So no optical isomerism.

So, which compounds exhibit optical isomerism? Only compound 2, which has a chiral center.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option A is 1,2,4. But according to my analysis, only 2 does. So none of the options seem to fit.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is an example of a diastereomer, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says 1,2,4. Option D is 1 and 2. So if only 2 is correct, but none of the options have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 has optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another approach: fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer. Now, in dimethyl maleate, the ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. Does that structure have any chiral centers? Let's see.

Structure of dimethyl maleate is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me with a double bond in the cis configuration. No, wait, no, maleate is the cis isomer. So the structure is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂Me with a double bond. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)-CH₂, but I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, perhaps compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back, which compounds do have optical isomerism? Only compound 2.

But looking at the options again, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Let me reevaluate compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl system with substituents on each ring at 2 and 6 positions. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester in the meta positions relative to the connecting bond. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other on the ring. So each ring looks the same.

So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry bisecting the central bond between the two rings. Thus, the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking again at the options, none of the options have only 2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has some kind of chirality. Let me think of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the two ester groups are on each end of the double bond in a way that creates a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality.

Wait, the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central carbon that's chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the double-bonded carbons are arranged in a way that makes each of those carbons a chiral center. Let me think: each of the CH groups adjacent to the double bond has a COOCH3 group, a double bond, and two Hs. So, each of those CH groups has substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. So each has two Hs, so they can't be chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 --> includes compound 4, which I think doesn't have it.

Option B: 3,4 --> both don't.

Option C: 2,3 --> only 2 has it.

Option D:1,2 --> neither 1 nor 2, but I thought 2 does.

Wait, the question says to choose which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. According to my analysis, only compound 2 does. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's imagine the structure:

MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me. Each of the CH groups adjacent to the double bond would have:

- MeO₂C (COOCH3) group,
- a double bond to the other CH,
- two Hs.

So each has substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. So each has two Hs, so no four different groups. So no chiral centers.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ester groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, perhaps all four compounds don't have optical isomerism except compound 2.

But according to the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). Since I think 1 and 4 don't have it, then only 2 would, but there's no option for that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Let me think again about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 (para on each ring).

But the two rings are connected at position 1. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta to the connecting bond. Wait, no: the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 relative to the connecting position (1). So on each ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other (para). So each ring has substituents in para positions relative to each other.

Now, the biphenyl system is connected at position 1 of each ring. So, the two rings are attached to each other, and each has substituents at 2 and 6.

But wait, perhaps the two rings are arranged in such a way that substituents on each ring are in a non-symmetrical arrangement, leading to the molecule as a whole being chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is such that the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so no optical isomerism.

So, I'm not sure about compound 1, but I think it's not chiral.

So, in summary:

Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is (E)-COOCH3-CH₂-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not a correct structure because that would be a five-membered ring or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a structure where the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond in between. So, the structure is:

MeO₂C-CH₂-CH=CH-CO₂Me.

In that case, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the double bond would each be attached to:

- MeO₂C,
- CH=CH,
- two Hs.

So each of those CH₂ groups would have substituents: MeO₂C, H, H, and the next group. But that doesn't give four different substituents, so no chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the central carbon (if it's attached to four different groups). But I'm not seeing that.

So, I think compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back to the options, the only correct option I've concluded is that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in another compound.

Wait, perhaps I missed another compound that does exhibit optical isomerism.

Let me think again:

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2.

But the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). Since I don't think 1 has it, but option D includes 2, then perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but I thought 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. So, if the only correct option is 2, but the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Alternatively, maybe compound 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think of another way: perhaps the structure is such that the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, the ester groups are on opposite sides (E configuration). So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't have that. Hmm. That suggests I might have made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 is a diastereomer, but that's not optical isomerism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality. For example, if the arrangement of substituents around the central bond creates a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the two nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl system, leading to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, say each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other on each ring. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

So, I think compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

But according to the options given, the only option that includes 2 is options A and D. Since I think 1 and 4 don't have it, then perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4) is incorrect, so perhaps the correct answer is option A is not correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps compound 4 can exhibit optical isomerism due to the arrangement of the substituents on the double bond. But no, that's geometric isomerism, not optical.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another thought: can a molecule with a double bond exhibit optical isomerism if there's a chiral center elsewhere? For example, maybe in compound 4, the substituents on the double bond lead to a chiral center.

Wait, let me imagine a molecule where the substituents on the double bond are different, and one of the carbons is a chiral center.

But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are COOCH3 on each end of the double bond. So, each CH group is attached to COOCH3, a double bond, and two Hs. So no chiral centers.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But given the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But why would 1 and 4 have optical isomerism?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Let me think again: maybe the substituents on the biphenyl create a chiral center. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1. So, the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond. So, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, then the molecule would be chiral.

But I'm not sure. To determine this, perhaps I can think: if you mirror the substituents across the central bond, do they match?

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl connection is at 1, so the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. Now, if you mirror the molecule across the central bond, the substituents would remain in the same positions, making the molecule symmetrical and thus achiral.

So, I think compound 1 isn't chiral.

So, I'm confident only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3), but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the central carbon if the substituents are arranged in a specific way. But I'm not seeing that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to optical isomerism.

Another approach: perhaps I should look up the structures of these compounds.

Wait, compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. This would have two nitro groups on each ring at position 6 and carboxylate groups at 2.

In such a structure, each ring is 2,6-dinitro and 2,6-dicarboxylate? No, wait, the compound is dimethyl, so each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring make the molecule asymmetrical. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

In that case, only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't account for that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in assessing compound 4. If dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center, then the correct answer would include 4.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that one of the carbons is a chiral center. Suppose the structure is MeO₂C-CH₂-CH=CH-CO₂Me. If the CH₂ groups are connected to different groups, perhaps leading to a chiral center.

Wait, the CH₂ groups in this structure would be attached to:

- MeO₂C,
- CH=CH,
- two Hs.

So each has substituents: MeO₂C, H, H, CH=CH. So, not four different groups; thus, no chiral center.

So, I think compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, after all this, I think the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2, which is option 2. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a chiral center if the substituents are arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is a chiral center. But I'm not seeing it.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4 have optical isomerism. But I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that dimethyl fumarate has a central chiral carbon. But I don't think so.

Another thought: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the two ester groups are on the same carbon, leading to a chiral center. But that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, and the structure is:

MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me.

In that case, the two carbonyl groups are on either end of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

So, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm stuck. According to my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's list each compound's possibility:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I think no.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: yes.

3. benzophenone: no.

4. dimethyl fumarate: no.

So the only correct is 2. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the options must have an answer. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps compound 4: dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me.

In this case, each of the CH groups is attached to:

- MeO₂C,
- H,
- double bond to the other CH,
- and another H.

So, each has two Hs; thus, no chiral centers.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Maybe it does have a chiral center.

Let me imagine the structure: biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each substituent is a nitro and a carboxylate.

So, the molecule as a whole: perhaps the arrangement of substituents is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. Another way: perhaps the biphenyl system with substituents at 2 and 6, when connected, creates a chiral center.

But I don't see how that would happen because each ring's substituents are symmetric. So, I think compound 1 isn't chiral.

So, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. If dimethyl fumarate is in the cis (Z) configuration, then perhaps it has a chiral center. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if the double bond is in the cis configuration, would that create a chiral center? No, because the substituents are on the same side, but the molecule would still be symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps in the cis configuration, the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a different structure that I'm not considering.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 1 and 2.

Wait, but I don't think 1 has it.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 1 and 2.

But according to my analysis, only 2 has it. So perhaps the question expects option A, but I'm not certain.

Another possibility: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center I'm not seeing.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3)-CH₂. In that case, the central CH=CH may have substituents that make the molecule chiral. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

In conclusion, based on my analysis, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, or perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to choose the option that includes only compound 2, but since it's not present, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I think I'm more confident about compound 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers (carbons bonded to four different groups) or other features that lead to optical activity.

---

### **Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
- The structure consists of a biphenyl system with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2.
- The biphenyl system is symmetric, with identical substituents on both rings. This symmetry likely results in a plane of symmetry for the molecule as a whole.
- Since the molecule is symmetrical, it is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
- The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃, where the central carbon (CH) is bonded to:
  - CH₃ (methyl group),
  - OH (hydroxyl group),
  - COOCH₃ (ester group),
  - H (hydrogen atom).
- This central carbon is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups.
- Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### **Compound 3: Benzophenone**
- The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups.
- The central carbon is sp² hybridized and not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups.
- Since the molecule is symmetrical and lacks chiral centers, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**
- The structure is (E)-MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.
- The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral.
- Since there are no chiral centers and the molecule is symmetrical, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Conclusion**
- Compound 1: No optical isomerism (symmetrical molecule).
- Compound 2: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center).
- Compound 3: No optical isomerism (symmetrical molecule).
- Compound 4: No optical isomerism (symmetrical molecule).

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **Compound 2**. However, none of the provided options include only Compound 2. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **Option A (1, 2, 4)**, assuming the question intends for Compound 1 or 4 to exhibit optical isomerism, despite the analysis suggesting otherwise.

**Answer: A**
