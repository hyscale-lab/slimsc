Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says a chemist did two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again, actually the first reaction produces (R)-, and the second (S)-. Or wait, no. Let me check. Oh, reaction A produces (R)- and reaction B produces (S)-.

So the products are enantiomers, I think. Because one is R and the other S. Because the starting materials are different, they're leading to different stereoisomers.

The reagents are LiBH4 and BH3 with H+ (which I think is usually a workup with something like H2O2 or something else, but in any case, these are borane-based reducing agents). Wait, but wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones, esters, etc. BH3 is often used for the same, but sometimes in different conditions.

Wait, but wait, the starting materials are A and B. Both are treated with different reducing agents to give the same product but different configurations.

Wait, but the products are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. Tetrahydro means it's saturated, so it's a cyclic ether, I think. Pyran-2-one would have a ketone at position 2. So the structure would have an oxygen in the ring, like a tetrahydropyran ring with a ketone.

Wait, but wait, the product is 4-ethyl-..., so the ethyl group is on carbon 4 of the ring. The ketone is on carbon 2. So when you have a pyran ring, the numbering is such that the oxygen is at position 1, right? So positions go 1 (oxygen), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So the product has a ketone on C2 and an ethyl on C4.

Hmm. So how do we get a pyranone from a reducing reaction?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the product is a ketone, perhaps the starting materials were something that can form a cyclic ketone via reduction. Let me think: maybe the starting materials are esters or ketals or something.

Wait, but when you reduce a ketone, you get an alcohol. Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. So perhaps the starting materials are something else. Wait, maybe epoxides? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that upon reduction forms a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, another approach: think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for esters, ketones, etc. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but sometimes used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration. Wait, but here both reactions are using borane-based reagents but with different reducing agents.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides? Or maybe they're cyclic ketones, but that seems less likely.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are acetals or ketals. Because when you reduce an acetal, you get an alcohol. Wait, but that's not leading to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are ketones with some protecting groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're cyclic hemiacetals or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters of some sort. Let's think of the product. The product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester or an acetal.

Wait, another thought: the product is a tetrahydropyranone. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone or ester group, which upon reduction forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diester or a diketone? Or perhaps a diol?

Wait, maybe it's an acetal. Let me think: if you have an acetal, perhaps upon treatment with a reducing agent, it could form an alcohol, but I'm not sure how that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Wait, reducing an epoxide typically leads to diols, but that's not a ketone.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters with a cyclic structure. Let's consider that.

Wait, let's think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen (at position 1), a ketone at 2, and an ethyl at 4.

So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, which can be formed from a cyclic hemiacetal, which is then reduced. Hmm, but reducing a hemiacetal would likely break the ring, not form it.

Wait, or perhaps the starting material is a lactone, which is an ester cyclic. So, if you have a gamma or delta lactone, and you reduce it, you can open it up or perhaps form a diol.

Wait, but that's not getting me closer to a cyclic ketone with ethyl substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals, and upon reduction, they form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but acetals are usually made from ketones and alcohols. So if you reduce an acetal, you get an alcohol and a ketone? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketal. Wait, ketal is similar to acetal but with two R groups attached to the oxygen. So, if you have a ketal with a carbonyl group, perhaps you can reduce it to form an alcohol.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the problem again.

The problem says that two different starting materials (A and B) are treated with different reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) to give enantiomers of the same product.

Wait, so the products are enantiomers because A and B are different, leading to R and S configurations.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. No, because reducing an epoxide would give a diol, not a ketone.

Another idea: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, upon reduction, forms the ketone. Wait, but a lactone is an ester, so LiBH4 would reduce it. For example, LiBH4 would reduce a lactone to a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals. A cyclic ketal would have two R groups attached to the oxygen. If you reduce that, you might break the ring. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters with substituents that, upon reduction, form a cyclic ketone. Not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the reagents might determine the configuration of the product. LiBH4 and BH3 might have different selectivities in certain reductions, perhaps in the formation of alcohols from ketones. Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting materials have a carbonyl group that gets reduced to a secondary alcohol, but then perhaps undergoes some ring formation.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3, they form alcohols, and then cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, but if the product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting material is an ester, perhaps after reduction, an aldol condensation or some kind of cyclization occurs.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about the product structure.

The product is (R or S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is six-membered with an oxygen, fully saturated (so a tetrahydropyran ring), and a ketone at C2 and an ethyl at C4.

So, the structure would have the ring: O is at position 1, C2 has a ketone, C4 has an ethyl group.

So, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that, when reduced, forms this ring.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone, then reducing the acetal would give the ketone. But that doesn't seem right because acetals are usually protecting groups. So, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ketals that upon reduction yields the ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with an ester group that upon reduction forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, but then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. If the starting material is an ester, say, something like ethyl acetoacetate, which is a beta-keto ester. But I'm not sure if that would form this ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Let's say a five-membered lactone. Upon reduction with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the lactone would open up to form a diol. Hmm, but that's a diol, not a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't seem to make sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. Let's say it's a six-membered epoxide, which upon reduction with LiBH4 becomes a diol, and then cyclizes to form the ring.

But again, I'm not sure how that would form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-butyrolactone (a five-membered lactone). Upon reduction, it would form a diol, but that's four carbons, so maybe not directly applicable.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3 (usually in the form of BH3Â·THF) is a milder reagent, but it's used in hydroboration reactions, such as the BH3-THF addition to alkenes to form alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition. But in this problem, it's used in a different context.

Wait, in some cases, BH3 can be used to reduce esters as well, but LiBH4 is more commonly used for that. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents are opening the epoxide in different ways. But again, I'm not seeing the connection to the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and the reagents are reducing the ketal to form the ketone. Let's say the starting material is a cyclic ketal, like a tetrahydropyran derivative. Reducing the ketal would break the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with substituents that, upon reduction, form the ring with the ethyl and ketone groups.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol, but how would that form the ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals of a ketone, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, the acetal is reduced to form the diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Let me think about the product again. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So, perhaps the starting material is a 3-ethyl-5-... wait, looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, in either R or S configuration.

Wait, the options are:

A) A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

B) Both are (R).

C) A is S, B is R.

D) A is R, B is S.

So, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is a pentanoic acid with substituents on carbons 3 and 5.

The structure would be: COOH (at C1), then CH2 at C2, then CH(CH2CH2CH3) (if ethyl is at C3), something at C5.

Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure is:

CH2-COOH (C1 and C2), then C3 is CH(CH2CH2CH3) (since ethyl is at C3), then C4, and C5 has both an isobutoxy and a ketone (oxo) group, plus a carboxylic acid at C1.

Wait, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Let me draw this out:

The structure is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) (C3) - something (C4) - C(O) (C5) - O-isobutyl.

Wait, perhaps it's:

1: COOH

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)

4: CH2-

5: C(O)OCH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write it as follows:

The molecule is pentanoic acid, so five carbons in total. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: isobutoxy and a ketone (oxo).

So, the structure is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3) - CH2 (C4) - C(O) (C5) - OCH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, pentanoic acid means the acid is on C1.

So, numbering is:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (ethyl group)

4: CH2

5: C(O) and isobutoxy.

Wait, but position 5 is the fifth carbon, which is the last one in pentanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no, because isobutoxy is OCH2CH(CH3)2, perhaps.

Wait, no, isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So isobutoxy is OCH2CH(CH3)2.

So the substituent at C5 is both a ketone (oxo) and an isobutoxy group. That seems a bit conflicting, because a ketone is a carbonyl group, so the substituent at C5 would be an oxygen with a carbonyl group and an isobutoxy group?

Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

At C5: a carbonyl (O) and an isobutoxy group attached. But that would mean two substituents on the same carbon, which is possible?

Wait, but wait, the formula is 5-oxo, which is a ketone, so the structure would have a carbonyl at C5. But also, an isobutoxy group attached as a substituent. So, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because C5 is the last carbon. Let me try to write the structure correctly.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

At C3: ethyl group. So, the structure is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) (C3) - CH2 (C4) - C(O) (C5) ?

But wait, the substituent at C5 is both an oxo (O) and an isobutoxy group. So, the C5 would have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an O-isobutyl group attached. That would be a geminal di-substitution, which is impossible unless it's part of a ring or a more complex structure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the pentanoic acid chain is:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) (C3) - CH2 (C4) - C(O) (C5) - OCH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon. So, C5 has both a carbonyl (as a ketone) and an isobutoxy group attached.

But that would require a carbon with a double bond to oxygen (as a ketone) and an ether linkage. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, but that would give the structure as:

COOH-(CH2)2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)O-CH(CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, but that's a six-membered chain with substituents. Hmm, no, because pentanoic acid has five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain. Let me count:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)

4: CH2

5: C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, but that would be a pentanoic acid with substituents at C3 and C5.

But how does that fit into the product being a cyclic ketone?

Hmm. Maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, and then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, the acetal is broken, and the ring is formed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then forms the cyclic ether with a ketone through some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with substituents that allow it to form the pyranone upon reduction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, ketones, aldehydes. BH3 is usually used as a hydroboration agent, but in some cases can reduce esters. However, I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Wait, considering the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction leads to ring opening and then ring formation again with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and upon reduction, the ring opens, and the product forms the pyranone.

Wait, let's say the starting material is a five-membered cyclic ketal. When you reduce it with LiBH4 or BH3, the ketal is reduced to a diol, which then cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but how would that happen? If the starting material is a five-membered cyclic ketal, reducing it would give a diol (1,2-diol), which under certain conditions, perhaps acidic or basic, could undergo cyclization to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the structure of the product again. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has an oxygen, a ketone at C2, and an ethyl at C4.

So the ring is:

O

|
C1

C2: O (as a ketone)
C3
C4: ethyl
C5
C6

So, in a chair-like structure, perhaps.

Now, if the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone, perhaps a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction would give a diol and then form the ring.

Wait, let me outline a possible mechanism. Suppose the starting material is a gamma-keto ester:

RCOCH2COOR'

When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester (R'COOR) to an alcohol, and the ketone (RCO) to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but wait, LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce ketones as effectively as aldehydes. Wait, no, it does reduce ketones, but perhaps with different selectivity.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic acetal. So, reducing it would break the acetal and form a diol, which then can form the ring with the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction would form a diol and then cyclize.

I think I'm not making progress on the structure, so perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry aspect.

The product has (R) and (S) configurations, which suggests that the starting materials have different configurations, and the reagents induce different stereochemistry in the product.

So, the starting materials A and B are enantiomers, perhaps, or diastereomers, leading to the R and S products.

Looking at the options, the options are that A and B are either the same or different enantiomers.

In the options, option D says A is R and B is S, and option C says A is S and B is R.

So, the starting materials are enantiomers, leading to products that are enantiomers.

Now, why would different reducing agents lead to different configurations in the product?

Perhaps because they have different selectivities in the reduction, leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, for example, in the reduction of an epoxide, the reagent might open the epoxide in a way that depends on the reagent's structure, leading to different diastereomers.

Alternatively, in the reduction of a ketone, the reagent might lead to different configurations.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester or another carbonyl compound, and the reduction leads to a secondary alcohol which then forms the ring.

Wait, but then how does the ring formation lead to the configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic acetal, which upon reduction forms a diol, and the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the reducing agent.

In that case, the configuration of the diol would determine the configuration of the ring when it cyclizes.

So, if the starting material is a cyclic acetal, and the reducing agent affects the stereochemistry of the diol, then the ring formed would have a specific configuration.

So, if the starting material is a cyclic acetal with a specific stereochemistry, and it's reduced with either LiBH4 or BH3, each leading to different diol configurations, which then form the pyranone with R or S configuration.

In that case, the starting materials (A and B) would need to be different, perhaps as enantiomers, leading to different diols and thus different configurations in the product.

So, the starting materials are enantiomeric cyclic acetals, and the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) cause the ring opening in a way that leads to diols with different configurations, which then cyclize to form R and S products.

Looking at the options: the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid in either R or S configuration.

Wait, that's a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. So, perhaps the starting material is an acetal or a ketal of a ketone.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

So, for example, the gamma-keto ester structure would be:

RCOCH2COOR'

Upon reduction with a strong reducing agent like LiBH4, the ester group (R'COO-) would be reduced to a CH2OH group, and the ketone (RCO-) would be reduced to RCH(OH)-.

Wait, but that would form a compound with two hydroxyl groups. Then, perhaps in the presence of acid, it could cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the starting material is a cyclic ester (like a lactone), then LiBH4 would open it up to form a diol, which could then undergo cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal of a ketone, which upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Assuming that, the configuration of the diol would determine the configuration of the product.

So, the key is that the reduction is stereoselective, leading to different configurations.

In that case, the starting material would have a certain configuration, and the reagent would determine the diol's configuration.

Thus, the starting materials (A and B) would have the same structure but different configurations, leading to different diols and thus different product configurations.

Wait, but the options have the same substituents but different configurations.

Looking back, the options are about the configuration of the starting material.

So, if A is (R) and B is (S), then when each is reduced, they would form (R) and (S) products, respectively.

Wait, but why would the reagent change the configuration? Or perhaps the reagent affects the diastereoselectivity of the reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal with a stereogenic center, and the reagent's approach affects the configuration of the diol formed upon reduction.

Thus, the same starting material with R configuration, when reduced with LiBH4, would form an R product, and when reduced with BH3, would form an S product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are different enantiomers, and when reduced with different reagents, each leads to a specific enantiomer in the product.

So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, it gives R product; B is S treated with BH3 gives S product.

But wait, the problem says that A is treated with LiBH4 to give R product, and B is treated with BH3 to give S product.

Thus, the starting materials A and B must have configurations that lead to R and S products when reduced with their respective reagents.

So, the key is that the starting materials A and B are enantiomers, and the reagents cause each to form the corresponding enantiomer in the product.

Thus, the correct option would have A and B as enantiomers, with A giving R and B giving S.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is S, B is R.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

Wait, let me think: If A is R and treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. B is S and treated with BH3, gives S product.

So, the correct starting materials would be A is R and B is S, which is option D.

But why would the reagents LiBH4 and BH3 affect the configuration in a way that requires the starting materials to be enantiomers?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diastereomers, leading to products that are enantiomers.

But I'm a bit stuck here.

Another angle: the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material was a diol that cyclized to form the ring.

The diol would have two hydroxyl groups, and the configuration of those OH groups would determine the configuration of the ring.

So, the diol's stereochemistry would directly influence the product's configuration.

Thus, if the starting material's stereochemistry (from A and B) is different, the diol would have different configurations, leading to the R and S products.

So, the starting materials must be enantiomers, leading to diols with opposite configurations, which then form R and S products.

Thus, the correct option would have A and B as enantiomers.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S.

But wait, in the problem statement, the product from A is R, and the product from B is S.

Thus, if A is R and B is S, and each leads to the corresponding product, that would make sense.

But wait, why would the reagents matter? The reagents would determine how the starting material is reduced to form the diol, which would influence the product's configuration.

So, perhaps the starting material's configuration and the reagent's approach (LiBH4 vs BH3) determine the diol's configuration, leading to the product's R or S.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is the same, but the reagents induce different configurations.

But the question states that A and B are treated with different reducing agents, leading to R and S products.

Wait, no, the problem says that A is treated with LiBH4, B with BH3.

So, if A and B are the same compound, but treated with different reagents, would that lead to different configurations? Or if A and B are enantiomers, leading to R and S products when treated with the same reagent.

Wait, perhaps the reagents have different selectivities in the reduction, leading to different diastereomers from the same starting material.

But in this case, the products are enantiomers, so the starting materials must be enantiomers, leading to enantiomeric diols, which then form enantiomeric products.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism.

Assuming the starting material is a cyclic acetal with a stereocenter. Let's say the acetal is (R) configuration.

When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the acetal to a diol. The approach of the hydride would determine the configuration of the diol.

Similarly, when BH3 is used, the approach would be different, leading to a different diol configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reducing agents reduce it to form an alcohol, which then cyclizes.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

The options are about the configurations of the starting materials. So, in the options, when A and B are treated with different reagents, the product configurations are R and S.

Thus, the correct starting materials must be such that when A is R and treated with LiBH4, it gives R product; B is S and treated with BH3, gives S product.

Looking at the options, option D says A is R and B is S.

So, the answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The starting materials, A and B, are treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the stereochemistry of the starting materials and how the reducing agents influence the formation of the enantiomeric products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a six-membered tetrahydropyran ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The enantiomeric nature of the products (R and S configurations) indicates that the starting materials must have different stereochemical properties.

2. **Starting Materials**: The starting materials are given as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. These compounds differ in the configuration of the stereocenter at position 3.

3. **Role of Reducing Agents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces esters and ketones. When applied to the starting material, it selectively reduces the ester group to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone ring.
   - **BH3**: A milder reducing agent that also reduces esters but may exhibit different stereochemical outcomes due to differences in the reduction mechanism or selectivity.

4. **Stereochemical Outcome**:
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material directly influences the stereochemistry of the product. If A is (R)-configured and treated with LiBH4, it produces the (R)-enantiomer of the product. Similarly, if B is (S)-configured and treated with BH3, it produces the (S)-enantiomer of the product.
   - The enantiomeric relationship between the starting materials ensures that the products are also enantiomers.

5. **Correct Option**:
   - Option D specifies that A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This configuration aligns with the observed stereochemical outcome of the products, where A with LiBH4 produces the (R)-enantiomer and B with BH3 produces the (S)-enantiomer.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B, as specified in option D.

**Answer: D**
