Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that astronomers are interested in their luminosities. From the problem, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The spectroscopy part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature. Got it.

Next, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But wait, how does that affect luminosity? Oh, wait, luminosity is an intrinsic property, so maybe the radial velocity is a red herring here. Or perhaps it's about Doppler shifting affecting the observed brightness. Hmm, but the problem states that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe that's already accounted for their velocities? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So I think the radial velocities might not directly affect the calculation of luminosity because the luminosity is an intrinsic property (what the star actually emits), not the observed flux. Oh, but wait, the observed flux depends on distance and velocity, but the problem is about the actual luminosity, not observed flux. So perhaps the 700 km/s is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity here. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The problem states that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is about the ratio L1/L2. Since they're both black bodies, I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. So L is proportional to R² T^4.

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, and T1 equals T2 because the peak wavelengths are the same. So substituting, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Since R1=1.5 R2 and T1=T2, the ratio is (1.5)^2 * (1)^4 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 should be 2.25 times that of Star_2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but why is there an option with ~2.32 or ~2.35? Did I miss something? Oh, perhaps I'm forgetting something about Doppler shift. Because the star is moving, the observed wavelength is different, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Wait, wait, maybe the Doppler effect affects the peak wavelength. So if one star is moving, does that change its observed peak wavelength?

Wait, so Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's think about the Doppler effect. The star is moving away if the radial velocity is positive, which would cause a redshift. The observed wavelength λ' is λ*(1 + v/c), approximately, for non-relativistic speeds. If Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s, and Star_1 has 0, then the observed wavelengths would be different. But the problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed peak wavelength would be longer than Star_1's. But according to the problem, the peak wavelengths are same. So perhaps the radial velocity of Star_2 must be such that the Doppler shift compensates for any intrinsic differences in temperature.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 equals T2 because their λ_max are same. But if Star_2 is moving, the observed λ_max would be shifted. So how does that affect the actual temperature?

I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify.

The problem says the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So when you observe them, their peak wavelengths are the same. But their actual temperatures could be different because of Doppler shift. So perhaps the observed λ_max is same, but the actual temperatures differ.

Wait, that complicates things. Because if Star_2 is moving, its actual temperature is different, but we perceive the peak wavelength as the same.

Let me recall the Doppler shift formula. The observed wavelength is longer if the star is moving away (redshift). So if the observed λ_max is same for both stars, but Star_2 is moving away, its actual temperature must be lower than Star_1. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if Star_2's observed λ_max is same, but it is moving away, that means the actual λ_max of Star_2 is shorter. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Suppose Star_2 is moving away with velocity v. The observed wavelength λ' = λ*(1 + v/c). So if Star_2's actual λ_max is λ2, then the observed is λ2*(1 + v/c). Similarly, Star_1's λ1 is observed as λ1 because it's not moving. The problem says λ1 (observed) = λ2 (observed), so λ1 = λ2*(1 + v/c).

But according to Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So λ1 / λ2 = T2 / T1.

Wait, let's write down the equations.

Given:

Star_1: λ1_observed = λ1 (since radial velocity is 0).

Star_2: λ2_observed = λ2 * (1 + v/c), where v is 700 km/s.

But the observed λ1_observed = λ2_observed. So:

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v/c)  --> equation (1)

Also from Wien's law:

λ1 = b / T1, and λ2 = b / T2, so λ1/λ2 = T2/T1.

Substituting into equation (1):

( T2/T1 ) = (1 + v/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Wait, that can't be right. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer, so T would be lower.

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, I think I mixed up the terms. Let me define correctly.

If the star is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength λ' is λ (source) * (1 + v/c).

But the actual temperature of the star is T2, so λ2 = b / T2.

The observed λ'2 = λ2 * (1 + v/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

For Star_1, no velocity, so λ'1 = λ1 = b / T1.

Since the observed wavelengths are same:

λ'1 = λ'2.

So, (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1 + v/c ) / T2

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

But that would mean T2 > T1, which contradicts my initial thought. Because if a star is moving away, we observe longer wavelength; if it's hotter, we'd expect shorter wavelength (blue shift). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the Doppler effect on the light. If a star is moving away, the light is redshifted. So the observed λ is longer. But according to Wien's law, a star with lower temperature has a longer λ_max. So if a star is moving away, the observed λ is longer. But that could be because the star itself is cooler, or it's moving away.

In this problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So if Star_2 is moving away (v=700 km/s), and Star_1 is stationary, then the observed λ_max is same. So what's the actual T1 and T2?

Using the equation we derived earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So T2 is greater than T1, because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2 would have a higher temperature than Star_1, but because it's moving away, the observed λ_max is same as Star_1.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers to see if this makes sense. Let's say v = 700 km/s. Let me compute (1 + v/c).

c is speed of light, about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = approximately 0.002333.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 is approximately 1.002333 * T1.

So Star_2 is a little hotter than Star_1.

But wait, earlier I thought since both observed λ_max are same, their temperatures are same. But that's only if there's no Doppler shift. So in this problem, because Star_2 is moving away, its actual temperature is a little higher to compensate.

Wait, this changes the approach to the problem. Because now, T2 is not equal to T1. So I need to include the Doppler effect when calculating their temperatures.

So the initial approach I took (assuming T1=T2) was wrong. Because the observed λ_max is same, but the actual temperatures may differ due to Doppler shift.

So, with that, the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Because L ∝ R² T^4.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

What about T1 and T2? From the above, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c ) ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * ( T1 / T2 )^4.

Compute (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Compute (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute 0.99767^2 first.

0.99767 * 0.99767 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995345.

Then, square that again: (0.995345)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why do the options include 2.25 (option A) which is the original factor without considering the Doppler effect. So the correct approach is to consider that because Star_2 is moving away, its actual temperature is a bit higher, which reduces the luminosity ratio from 2.25 to about 2.23.

So the answer should be option D.

To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 

\[
L \propto R^2 T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
2. **Observed Peak Wavelengths**: Both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), this implies that the observed temperatures are the same. However, the radial velocity of Star_2 introduces a Doppler shift, which affects its actual temperature.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{actual}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

For Star_2, the observed peak wavelength is the same as Star_1's. Thus, the actual temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than Star_1's to compensate for the redshift. Using the relationship \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c) \), where \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + 700/300000) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

Thus, \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 1 / 1.002333 \approx 0.99767 \).

### Luminosity Ratio:
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]

Substituting \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99767 \):

1. \( (R_1 / R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
2. \( (T_1 / T_2)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4 \)

To compute \( (0.99767)^4 \), first calculate \( (0.99767)^2 \):

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 1 - 2 \cdot 0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 \approx 0.995345
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
(0.995345)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus, \( (T_1 / T_2)^4 \approx 0.9907 \).

Finally, the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. The correct answer is:
