Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are looking at two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because lambda is inversely proportional to T. So T1 equals T2.

Then, radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity probably affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But wait, the question is about luminosity, not observed brightness. So maybe the radial velocity affects the calculation of luminosity? Or perhaps not. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, not what we observe. Oh, wait, but when calculating luminosity from observed data, Doppler shift could affect the observed flux or affect the distance measurement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the radial velocities might relate to the Doppler shift, which could affect the observed wavelength, but in this problem, they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So perhaps the stars' own temperatures are same, so their emitted peak wavelengths are same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the question is about the luminosity. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since both stars have the same T, then the ratio of their luminosities would be (R1/R2)² times (T1² / T2²), but since T1=T2, that part cancels out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have 2.23, 2.25, etc. So option A is 2.25.

But wait, the question says that they computed the luminosity, considering that the stars radiate as black bodies. So maybe other factors are involved. What about the radial velocities? The velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How would that affect luminosity?

Hmm. Oh, wait. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness—the total energy emitted per second. But when we observe a star, the flux (apparent brightness) depends on distance and luminosity. But in this case, the problem says they computed the luminosity using the blackbody formula, so perhaps the radial velocity doesn't directly affect L. Or does it?

Wait, the radial velocity could affect the measured flux because of Doppler shifting. If a star is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is shorter than emitted. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same, so perhaps the Doppler effect was accounted for when determining the temperatures. Because the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed lambda_max is the same, but the actual emitted lambda_max (and thus T) could be different if they were moving. Oh wait, no, because if Star_2 is moving with velocity v, its emitted wavelengths would be Doppler shifted, so the observed lambda_max would be different. But in this case, the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So that implies that their emitted wavelengths, adjusted for Doppler shift, are the same.

So let me think: suppose Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. The Doppler shift would affect the observed wavelength. To have the same observed lambda_max as Star_1 (which is stationary, v=0), the actual emitted lambda_max for Star_2 must be longer. Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, so observed lambda is shorter than emitted. So for observed lambda_max to be same as Star_1's emitted lambda_max, Star_2 must have a higher emitted lambda_max. Because if Star_2's emitted lambda is longer, and blueshifted, it'll match Star_1's emitted lambda.

So let's model this. The Doppler shift formula is approximately (for non-relativistic speeds):

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, when the star is moving towards us, v is positive. So lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )^{-1}? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the formula right. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, or is it (1 - v/c) in the denominator for approaching? Wait, no, wait. For a source moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter. So the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of frequency or energy, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. Let's denote this as lambda_obs.

For Star_1, since v1 =0, lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s towards us. So lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) ) )

But lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs.

So, lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs / sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

= lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Since lambda_emit is inversely proportional to T (from Wien's law), so T_propto 1/lambda_emit.

Wait, but for blackbody radiation, the peak wavelength lambda_emit = b / T. So T = b / lambda_emit.

So, T2 = b / lambda_emit2.

Similarly, T1 = b / lambda_emit1 = b / lambda_obs.

So, T2 = b / (lambda_emit2) = b * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) ) / (b / lambda_obs) )? Wait, maybe I should express T2 in terms of T1.

Alternatively, let's express lambda_emit2 in terms of lambda_obs.

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So, since lambda_emit is inversely proportional to T, T2 = T1 * (lambda_obs / lambda_emit2 )

= T1 * [1 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) ]

= T1 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Wait, so T2 is lower than T1 because the sqrt term is less than 1.

Wait no, because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda is shorter than emitted. But according to the problem, both observed lambda are same. So the emitted lambda for Star_2 must be longer than Star_1's emitted lambda. Because when moving towards us, the observed lambda is shorter than emitted.

Wait, so if Star_1's emitted lambda is lambda_obs (v=0), then Star_2's emitted lambda is lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Because lambda_obs = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So solving for lambda_emit2: lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which is larger than lambda_obs because (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) is greater than 1.

So, lambda_emit2 > lambda_obs.

Which implies T2 = b / lambda_emit2 < T1 = b/lambda_obs.

So, T2 is less than T1. Because if a star is moving towards us, its observed lambda is shorter, but the actual emitted lambda is longer. So its temperature is lower.

Wait, but if T2 is lower, then when calculating luminosity, since L = 4π R^2 sigma T^4, the luminosity of Star_2 would be lower than if T were same as Star_1.

But wait, the problem says that when the astronomers computed the luminosity, they assumed blackbody radiation. So perhaps they used the observed lambda_max to calculate T, but that would be incorrect if the star is moving. Because if the star is moving, the observed lambda is not the emitted lambda.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars appeared brightest at the same wavelength, so the observed lambda_max is same. But if they used that observed lambda to compute T, then their calculated T would be wrong because of Doppler shift. But the problem says they computed luminosity assuming blackbody radiation, so perhaps they correctly accounted for the Doppler shift when determining T.

Wait, maybe not. The problem states: "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So perhaps the question is asking what the ratio of their intrinsic luminosities is, considering their actual R and T.

But wait, when calculating L, using the observed data, if the star is moving, you have to correct for the Doppler shift to get the correct T and R. Because the observed flux is affected by the Doppler effect and the star's velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply that the luminosity is L = 4π R² sigma T⁴, but to compute L, you need the actual R and T of the star. But the observed flux F is affected by distance and Doppler shift.

Wait, but in the problem, the astronomers found that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, which is the observed lambda_max. So for each star, they would calculate T based on that observed lambda_max. But if Star_2 is moving, the observed lambda_max is not the same as the star's actual lambda_max. So when calculating T, they would be getting it wrong.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed luminosity assuming black body. So perhaps they used the observed lambda_max to compute T, without considering the Doppler shift. So their computed T would be wrong.

Wait, let's think again.

Star_1: v=0. Observed lambda_max is lambda1. So actual emitted lambda is same as observed, because no Doppler shift. So T1 = b / lambda1.

Star_2: v=700 km/s. Observed lambda_max is lambda1 as well. But the actual emitted lambda_max for Star_2 is longer. So when the astronomers compute T for Star_2, they would think lambda_max is lambda1, so T2 would be computed as (b / lambda1). But in reality, Star_2's actual T is lower, because T = b / (lambda_emit), and lambda_emit is longer than lambda1.

Wait, no, because if the star is moving towards us, the observed lambda_max is shorter than the emitted. But in this case, the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1's, which is lambda1. So Star_2's emitted lambda must be longer. So its actual T is lower.

But the astronomers, not knowing about the Doppler shift, would take the observed lambda_max (lambda1) and compute T as T2 = b/lambda1, which is same as T1. But that's incorrect. So when they compute luminosity, they would think that T2 is same as T1, but in reality, T2 is lower.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using black body radiation. So perhaps they used the observed lambda_max to compute T. So in that case, their calculated T for both stars would be same (T1 = T2 = b / lambda_obs), but in reality, T2 is lower.

But how does this affect the calculated luminosity? Let's see.

If the astronomers assume that both T1 and T2 are same, and that Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2, then their calculated L1 would be ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) * T^4, and L2 would be (R2^2) * T^4. So L1/L2 = (2.25 R2² T^4) / (R2² T^4) ) = 2.25.

But in reality, the actual T2 is lower. So their calculation overestimates L2, because they think T is higher than it actually is.

Wait, no. Wait, let's rephrase. The problem is about the actual luminosity, not what the astronomers compute. The question is about the actual factor by which L1 is greater than L2.

Because the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." but no, the actual question is, "they computed the luminosity... by a factor of..." Or wait, the question is: "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

Wait, but the options are all around 2.2 or 2.3, which suggests that the Doppler shift must be affecting the calculation.

So, perhaps the problem is that when calculating the luminosity, the astronomers must correct for the Doppler shift in the flux.

Wait, let's think about flux. The flux F is the observed power per unit area. The flux received from a star is F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer. Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the Doppler shift affects the observed flux. Because the star's emission is being blueshifted, the observed flux is higher.

Alternatively, the flux from a star moving towards us is higher due to the Doppler boost. So when calculating luminosity, you have to correct for this Doppler effect.

So, the formula for luminosity in terms of observed flux is L = 4 pi d^2 F_obs / (1 + v_r/c )

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about it.

The observed flux F_obs is related to the intrinsic luminosity and the distance, but also the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift affects the observed flux because the photons are being compressed (if moving towards us) leading to higher flux.

So, the relation is F_obs = (L / (4 pi d^2)) * (1 + v_r / c )

Wait, no, wait. The exact formula for flux considering Doppler effect is F_obs = F_emit * (1 + v_r/c), where F_emit is the flux as measured in the rest frame of the star.

Alternatively, since F is power per area, and power is energy per time. If the star is moving towards us, the rate at which photons arrive increases, so F_obs = F_emit * (1 + v_r/c) / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), but that's for relativistic speeds. But 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (c ≈ 3e5 km/s), so non-relativistic.

So, for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler factor is approximately 1 + v_r/c. So F_obs ≈ F_emit * (1 + v_r/c )

But F_emit would be L / (4 pi d^2), assuming d is the distance. So putting it together, F_obs = (L / (4 pi d^2)) * (1 + v_r/c )

So if the astronomers are using the observed flux to compute L, they would compute L = 4 pi d^2 F_obs / (1 + v_r/c )

But if they don't account for the Doppler shift, they would think that F_obs = L / (4 pi d^2 ), leading to L = 4 pi d^2 F_obs.

But in reality, because of the Doppler shift, F_obs is higher. So the calculated L without Doppler correction would be higher than the actual L by a factor of (1 + v_r/c ).

Wait, but the question is about the stars' actual luminosity, not the observed flux. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body radiation formula. So perhaps they used the observed flux, but without correcting for Doppler.

So, for each star, the observed flux F_obs is proportional to (L / (4 pi d^2 )) * (1 + v_r/c )

But when calculating L, they use F_obs = L / (4 pi d^2 ), so their computed L would be L_calculated = 4 pi d^2 F_obs = L * (1 + v_r/c )

So, their calculated L would be higher than the actual L by a factor of (1 + v_r/c )

Wait, but Star_1 has v_r=0, so L1_calculated = L1.

Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. So L2_calculated = L2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 ) ≈ L2 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 L2.

But the question is, what is the actual L1 compared to actual L2? Because the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... So perhaps the question is about the actual L1/L2, which depends on their R and T.

Wait, but earlier, the assumption was that T1 and T2 are same, because the observed lambda_max is same. But because of Doppler, T2 is lower.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to model this step by step.

Given:

- R1 = 1.5 R2.

- M1 = 1.5 M2. (But mass isn't directly relevant here, unless we're using some mass-luminosity relation, but the question says to assume blackbody radiation, so I think M doesn't matter.)

- Observed lambda_max for both stars is same (lambda_obs).

- Star_1 has v_r=0, Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s towards us.

We need to find the actual luminosity ratio L1/L2.

But to compute this, we need the actual T1 and T2.

But lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v_r/c) / (1 + v_r/c) )

So for Star_1: lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs.

For Star_2: lambda_obs = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v_r/c) / (1 + v_r/c) )

So, lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

Which makes lambda_emit2 longer than lambda_obs.

Since T = b / lambda_emit, T2 = b / lambda_emit2 = (b / lambda_obs) * sqrt( (1 - v_r/c) / (1 + v_r/c) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v_r/c) / (1 + v_r/c) )

So, T2 is less than T1.

So, actual T ratio is T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

Plugging in v_r = 700e3 m/s, c=3e5e3 m/s.

v_r/c = 700e3 / (3e5e3) ) = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3e2) = approx 0.0023333.

So, (1 + v_r/c) ≈ 1.0023333.

(1 - v_r/c) ≈ 0.9976667.

So the ratio (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.9976667) ≈ approx 1.00468.

So sqrt(1.00468) ≈ approx 1.00234.

So T1/T2 ≈ 1.00234.

So T1 ≈ 1.00234 T2.

Wait, but let's calculate it more accurately.

v_r =700 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s.

v_r/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3e3) = 0.0023333...

So, (1 + v/c) = 1.002333333.

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

The ratio (1.002333333)/(0.997666667) = approx 1.00467.

The square root of 1.00467 is approx 1.00233. Because (1.00233)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1.00466 + negligible ≈ 1.00466, which is close to 1.00467.

So, T1/T2 = 1.00233.

So, T1 ≈ 1.00233 T2.

Now, the luminosity ratio is L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T1^4) ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

= (2.25 R2²) / R2² * (T1^4)/(T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4

= 2.25 * (1.00233)^4.

What's (1.00233)^4?

We can approximate using the binomial expansion.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x², where x is small.

x = 0.00233.

n=4.

So,

(1.00233)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.00233) + (4*3/2)*(0.00233)^2

= 1 + 0.00932 + 6*(0.0000054289)

= 1 + 0.00932 + 0.0000325734

≈ 1.00935257.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935257 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00935 ≈ 0.0210375.

Total ≈ 2.25 + 0.02104 ≈ 2.271.

So, approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options:

Options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

2.27 is closer to 2.25 (option A) than 2.23 (option D), but wait, maybe my approximation is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the calculation of the luminosity as seen from Earth, but the question is about the actual intrinsic luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the observed lambda_max is the same, but the actual T is same for both stars. But that's impossible because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, let's think again. The observed lambda_max is same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual emitted lambda_max for Star_2 is longer. So, their actual temperatures are different.

So, the correct approach is to find the actual T for each star, considering their velocities, and then compute L1/L2.

So, as done earlier.

Now, another approach is to compute the exact (1.00233)^4.

Let me compute 1.00233^4 more accurately.

1.00233^2 = (1 + 0.00233)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 = 1.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 1.004665429.

Then, 1.004665429 squared is (1.004665429)^2.

Which is approximately 1 + 2*(0.00466) + (0.00466)^2.

= 1 + 0.00932 + (approx 0.0000217)

≈ 1.0093417.

So 1.00233^4 ≈ 1.0093417.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0093417≈ 2.25 * 1.00934 ≈ 2.25 + (2.25 * 0.00934) = 2.25 + 0.021015 = 2.271015.

So, about 2.27.

The options are A)2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 is closer to 2.25 (option A) than 2.23 (option D). But the options don't have 2.27. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the calculation of the luminosity as observed. Because luminosity is the intrinsic property, but when calculating it from the observed flux, you have to adjust for Doppler.

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity, assuming the stars are black bodies. So perhaps the calculation uses the observed flux and the observed lambda_max to compute T, but without considering the Doppler shift. So their computed T would be wrong, leading to wrong L.

So, for Star_1, v=0, so their T1 is correct.

For Star_2, v=700 km/s towards us.

The observed lambda_max is lambda_obs.

But the actual emitted lambda_max is lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, the astronomers would compute T2 as (b / lambda_obs ), same as T1, but in reality, T2 is lower: T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, the astronomers think that T1 = T2, but in reality T2 is lower.

Then, their computed L would be based on the assumption that T1 = T2. So,

L1_computed = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2_computed = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T1^4.

Because they think T2 = T1.

So,

L1_computed / L2_computed = (R1^2 / R2^2) = (2.25) as before.

But the question is about the actual luminosity, not the computed. So the actual L1 is 2.25*(T1^4 / T2^4).

Which is 2.25*( (T1/T2)^4 )

Which is approximately 2.25 * (1.00233)^4 ≈ 2.27, as before.

But the options don't have 2.27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the calculated L refers to the astronomers' computed values, not the actual luminosities.

The question says: "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, perhaps the question is about the ratio of their computed luminosities, not the actual.

But that would be different. Let's think: the astronomers computed L1 and L2 without considering Doppler shift.

So, for Star_2, when calculating L2, they used the observed flux, but didn't correct for Doppler.

Wait, but how is L calculated? Because L is intrinsic, but if the observed flux is affected by Doppler, then perhaps they can calculate L as L = 4 pi d^2 F / (1 + v/c).

But if they don't account for the Doppler shift, their calculated L would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when calculating the luminosity from the observed flux, you have to account for the Doppler shift, otherwise you would overestimate the luminosity.

So, the actual L is L = 4 pi d^2 F_obs / (1 + v_r/c )

But the astronomers might compute L without this correction, leading to an overestimated L.

So, for Star_1: v_r=0, so L1_computed = 4 pi d1^2 F1_obs.

For Star_2: v_r=700 km/s, so L2_computed = 4 pi d2^2 F2_obs.

But the flux F_obs depends on the distance and actual luminosity.

Wait, but without knowing the distances, perhaps we can relate them based on other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the observed flux for Star_2 is higher due to Doppler shift, so when astronomers compute L using F_obs without correction, they think L2 is higher than it actually is.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's re-express the problem.

Alternative approach: The luminosity is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

The observed flux from a star is F = L / (4 pi d^2) * (1 + v_r / c )

So, F_obs = (L / (4 pi d^2 )) * (1 + v_r / c )

Thus, if they compute L using F_obs without the Doppler correction, they would calculate L' = 4 pi d^2 F_obs = L (1 + v_r/c )

So, L' (computed) = L (1 + v_r/c )

Thus, for Star_1: v_r=0, so L1_computed = L1.

For Star_2: v_r=700 km/s, so L2_computed = L2 * (1 + 700e3/(3e5e3) ) ≈ L2 * 1.002333.

So, the computed luminosity ratio L1_computed / L2_computed = (L1) / (L2 * 1.002333 )

But the actual ratio of luminosities is L1 / L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 ) ) = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Earlier, we found T1 / T2 ≈ 1.00233.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.271.

But the question is, what is the ratio of their computed luminosities, L1_computed / L2_computed.

Which would be (L1) / ( L2 * 1.002333 ) = (L1/L2 ) / 1.002333 ≈ (2.271) / 1.002333 ≈ approx 2.266.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.266.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute (T1/T2)^4 more accurately.

As before, T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = sqrt( (1.002333333)/(0.997666667) ) = sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So, (1.00233)^4 = (1.00233)^2 * (1.00233)^2.

We had (1.00233)^2 ≈ 1.00467.

So, 1.00467 squared is (1.00467)^2 = 1.00937.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00937.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.271.

But the options don't have 2.27, so perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler effect. Then, L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But why would the question include the Doppler shift info if it's not relevant? Probably because it's a trick. Because even though the stars have same observed lambda_max, their actual temperatures are different.

So, the correct answer should account for Doppler, leading to a slightly higher ratio than 2.25. Which is approximately 2.27, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.25, but that would neglect the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the measured radius or other parameters.

Wait, no, radius is a physical parameter, independent of velocity. So the radius given is the actual radius.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but since the question is about luminosity, which is intrinsic, the Doppler shift doesn't directly affect L.

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body. So perhaps the Doppler shift isn't a factor in the computation.

So, the only factors are R and T, and since T is determined from the observed lambda_max, which is same for both, T would be same. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But earlier reasoning suggested that T is different. So perhaps the question is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, considering that it's small (700 km/s is small compared to c), so the temperature difference is negligible.

So, perhaps the intended answer is 2.25.

But the problem states that the stars have the same observed lambda_max, which would imply same T only if there's no Doppler shift. So if the Doppler shift is considered, T would be different.

But given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25 (option A), but the presence of the Doppler shift info suggests that the correct approach includes it, leading to a ratio slightly higher than 2.25, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.32, which is 2.25 * approx 1.032.

Our calculated ratio is 2.27, which is 2.25 * 1.0093 (approx 1.0093), which is about 0.93% increase.

But none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler factor.

Wait, let's recompute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) more accurately.

v =700 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s.

v/c=700/3e5=7/(3e3)=0.00233333...

So,

(1 + v/c) =1.0023333333.

(1 - v/c)=0.9976666667.

The ratio is 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Compute that exactly.

Compute 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

We can write it as (1 + 7/3e3) / (1 - 7/3e3).

= (3e3 +7)/(3e3 -7) ) / (3e3)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute:

0.9976666667 * 1.0046666667 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute it as (1 + 0.0023333333) / (1 - 0.0023333333).

Using the formula (a + b)/(a - b) where a=1, b=0.0023333333.

So, (1 + b)/(1 - b) = (1 + 2b + b²)/(1 - b²) approximately, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps compute as (1 + b) * (1/(1 - b)).

1/(1 - b) ≈ 1 + b + b² + b³ + ... 

So,

(1 + b) * (1 + b + b² + b³ + ... ) = 1 + 2b + 2b² + 2b³ + ... 

Which for small b is approximately 1 + 2b + 2b².

So, for b=0.0023333333:

1 + 2b + 2b² = 1 + 2*(0.0023333333) + 2*(0.0023333333)^2

= 1 + 0.0046666666 + 2*(0.0000054333)

= 1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000108666

= 1.004677533.

So, (1 + b)/(1 - b) ≈ 1.004677533.

So the ratio is approximately 1.004677533.

Then, the square root of this is sqrt(1.004677533) ≈ 1.002335.

So, T1/T2 = 1.002335.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.002335)^4.

Compute (1.002335)^4.

We can compute (1.002335)^2 = approx 1.004676.

Then, square that: (1.004676)^2 = approx 1.00937.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00937.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.271.

But again, none of the options match.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm. 2.271 is between 2.25 and 2.32. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.25, but the correct calculation gives something higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem states that the observed lambda_max is same. So the correct approach must consider that T1 and T2 are different, leading to a higher ratio.

But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is B) 2.32.

Wait, 2.32 is approximately 2.25 * 1.03185.

Which would correspond to (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.03185.

So, T1/T2 ≈ (1.03185)^(1/4) ≈ approx 1.0078.

Which would imply a higher v/c ratio.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me try using v=700 km/s again.

v = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(3e3) = 0.0023333.

So, the ratio (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) = approx 1.0046775.

The square root of that is sqrt(1.0046775) ≈ 1.002335.

Thus, (T1/T2) = 1.002335.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.002335)^4.

Compute (1.002335)^2 = (approx) 1.004676.

Then, (1.004676)^2 = approx 1.00937.

So, 2.25 * 1.00937 = 2.271.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise methods.

Compute (1.00233)^4.

Compute ln(1.00233) = approx 0.002327.

Multiply by 4: 0.009308.

Exponentiate: e^0.009308 ≈ 1.00936.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00936 ≈ 2.271.

Since none of the options are close, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift.

In that case, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But the question includes the Doppler shift info, so perhaps the intended answer is C) 2.35, but that's higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But if the observed wavelength is same, but due to Doppler, the actual T of Star_2 is lower, which would make L2 lower.

But perhaps the way the question is phrased, the luminosity ratio is computed considering Doppler. So let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the computed luminosities, considering Doppler.

If the astronomers computed the luminosity without considering that Star_2 is moving, their calculated L2 would be higher than actual.

So, the computed L2' = L2 * (1 + v_r/c )

Similarly, computed L1' = L1.

So, the ratio would be L1' / L2' = (L1) / (L2 * (1 + v/c) )

Which is (L1/L2) / (1 + v/c )

We have L1/L2 = 2.271.

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333.

So, L1' / L2' = 2.271 / 1.002333 ≈ 2.265.

Which is about 2.265, again not matching any options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity affects the calculation of the radius via Doppler beaming, but I don't think that's the case. Radius is a physical parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is F = L/(4 pi d^2) * (1 + v_r/c ), so when calculating L from F, you get L = 4 pi d^2 F / (1 + v_r/c ).

So, if the astronomers didn't correct for this, their computed L would be L' = 4 pi d^2 F = L (1 + v_r/c )

So, L1_computed = L1.

L2_computed = L2 * (1 + v_r/c )

So, the computed ratio is L1_computed / L2_computed = (L1) / (L2 (1 + v_r/c) )

= (L1/L2) * 1/(1 + v_r/c )

= (2.271) * (1/1.002333 ) ≈ 2.271 * 0.99767 ≈ 2.26.

Again, no option matches.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Perhaps the question is simply about the Stefan-Boltzmann law, ignoring Doppler, so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But why include the Doppler shift info then? Maybe it's a red herring.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed brightness, but the luminosity is an intrinsic property. So the actual luminosity ratio is 2.25, regardless of observed flux.

But the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of...", which implies that the computed luminosity is being considered.

But if the astronomers used the observed flux to compute luminosity without considering the Doppler shift, their computed L2 would be higher than actual.

So, the computed L1_computed = L1.

Computed L2_computed = L2 * (1 + v_r/c )

Thus, the computed ratio L1_computed / L2_computed = L1 / ( L2 * (1 + v/c) )

= (L1 / L2 ) * (1/(1 + v/c) )

We have L1/L2 = 2.271.

v/c = 0.002333.

So, 1/(1 + v/c ) = 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

Thus, computed ratio is 2.271 * 0.99767 ≈ 2.265.

Again, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the actual luminosity ratio, which is 2.27, but the closest option is B)2.32.

But 2.27 is closer to 2.25 (0.02 difference) than to 2.32 (0.05 difference).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the (1.00233)^4 term.

Wait, let me compute 1.00233^4 more precisely.

1.00233^1 = 1.00233

1.00233^2 = 1.00233 * 1.00233.

Let's compute:

1.00233 * 1.00233:

= (1 + 0.00233) * (1 + 0.00233)
= 1^2 + 2*1*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2
= 1 + 0.00466 + 0.0000054289
= 1.0046654289.

Then, 1.0046654289^2:

= (1.0046654289)^2
= 1^2 + 2*1*0.0046654289 + (0.0046654289)^2
= 1 + 0.0093308578 + 0.000021763
= 1.0093526208.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.0093526208.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0093526208 ≈ 2.271091.

So, about 2.271.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option A)2.25, which is 2.25, and option D)2.23.

2.271 is closer to 2.25 (difference of 0.021) than to 2.23 (difference of 0.041). But perhaps the intended answer is option B)2.32, which is 2.32, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.

Wait, in the initial approach, I assumed that the problem requires the actual luminosity ratio, which is 2.271. But perhaps the question is asking for the computed luminosity ratio, which is L1_computed / L2_computed = (L1) / (L2 * (1 + v/c) ), which is (2.271) / 1.002333 ≈ 2.265.

Still, that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the calculation of the star's radius through some other method. But I don't think so; the radius is a physical property, not observed through Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity affects the determination of the star's temperature, leading to a miscalculation of L.

But I'm not making progress here. Given the options, and the fact that the intended answer is likely to ignore the Doppler effect, the answer would be A) 2.25.

But the problem states that both stars have same observed lambda_max. So, to have same observed lambda_max, their actual emitted lambdas must be different, leading to different temperatures.

Thus, the correct approach must include the Doppler effect, leading to a ratio of approximately 2.27, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D)2.23, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Doppler shift.

Wait, let's think again about the Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Thus, T2 = b / lambda_emit2 = b / ( lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

= (b / lambda_obs ) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

(T1/T2)^2 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = ( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c ) )^2

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * ( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c ) )^2

Because L is proportional to R^2 T^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * ( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c ) )^2

= 2.25 * ( (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) )^2

= 2.25 * (1.0046775)^2.

Compute (1.0046775)^2.

1.0046775 *1.0046775.

= 1 + 2*(0.0046775) + (0.0046775)^2.

= 1 + 0.009355 + 0.00002188.

= ~1.00937688.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00937688 ≈ 2.2711.

Again, same result.

So, no option matches. Perhaps the problem intended to ignore Doppler, making the answer 2.25, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the observed luminosity ratio, but that doesn't make sense because luminosity is intrinsic.

In conclusion, the correct calculation, considering Doppler, gives approximately 2.27, but since it's not an option, the intended answer is likely A) 2.25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The key parameters provided are:

- **Radius**: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
- **Mass**: Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times larger than Star_2, but mass is not directly relevant for this calculation.
- **Observed Wavelength**: Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), implying the same observed peak wavelength.
- **Radial Velocity**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), while Star_2 has \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (towards the observer).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Temperature Relationship**:
   - The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is governed by Wien's Law:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \frac{b}{T}
     \]
     where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, the temperatures must satisfy:
     \[
     T_1 = T_2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
     \]
     where \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v_2/c = 0.002333 \), we find:
     \[
     T_1 / T_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} \approx \sqrt{1.0046775} \approx 1.00233
     \]

2. **Luminosity Relationship**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
     Substituting \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.00233 \), we compute:
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.00233)^4 \approx 1.00935
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot 1.00935 = 2.25 \cdot 1.00935 \approx 2.271
     \]

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - The calculated ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.271 \) does not exactly match any of the provided options. However:
     - **Option A (2.25)**: This corresponds to the case where the Doppler shift is ignored, and the temperatures are assumed equal (\( T_1 = T_2 \)). This is a simplification but aligns with \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \), giving \( L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
     - **Option D (2.23)**: This is closer to the calculated value of \( 2.271 \) than \( 2.25 \), but it still underestimates the ratio.
     - **Options B (2.32) and C (2.35)**: These values are significantly higher than the calculated ratio and are inconsistent with the given parameters.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While the correct calculation considering the Doppler shift gives \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.271 \), none of the options match this value. The problem likely intends for the Doppler shift to be ignored, leading to the simpler result \( L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \).

ANSWER: A
