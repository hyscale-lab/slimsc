Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation in stars, it's related to the thermal equilibrium, right? Oh, wait, the problem says both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a gas. The formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, it's given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. Wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think that means the ratio n_i/n_j is 2 for star_1, and maybe a different value for star_2? Or wait, maybe both are compared to each other. Let me read the question again.

The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. Oh, so for the same energy levels, the excitation (population) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j), perhaps? Or maybe it's (n_i for star1) / (n_i for star2) )= 2? Wait, no, the energy levels are the same, so maybe it's (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j)?

Wait, the question says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given. So E_i and E_j have a difference ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote this as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So for star_1, the ratio n1_i/n1_j = 2. And for star_2, perhaps the ratio is different. Or wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1, so maybe n1_i = 2 * n2_i? Or perhaps it's that for the same atoms, in the same energy level, star_1 has twice the population?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So maybe the number of atoms in that excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1_i = 2 n2_i, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it because the temperatures might be different, so the populations would depend on both the statistical weights and the temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations in each star is different. Let me think: for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, (n_i/n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, for star_2, (n'_i /n'_j )= (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that the ratio is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Wait, no, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio (n1_i/n1_j) is twice (n2_i/n2_j). Or maybe the population in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation is higher in star_1. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's say n1_i = 2 n2_i, but considering that each star's temperature affects the excitation.

Wait, but the Boltzmann factor depends on T. So in star_1, the excitation is higher, which would imply that star_1 is hotter. Because higher temperature means more atoms are in higher energy states.

So taking the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star_1: (n1_i)/(n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n2_i)/(n2_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So perhaps (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j)

Wait, but that would mean (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Oh wait, since the g_i/g_j is the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), it would cancel out. So the equation becomes:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logs on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Hmm, let me rearrange that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k) / ΔE

Let me compute that. Let me remember that k is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So substituting in:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ] / (1.38e-23 J )

The 1.38e-23 terms cancel out, so we have:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / 1 → (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same as (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals ln(2). Rearranging, (1/T1 - 1/T2) = - ln(2)

But let's see the options. The options are in terms of the difference (T1 - T2) or (T2 - T1), etc.

Wait, the equation I have is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2). Let me factor that differently.

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

But perhaps I should write it as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). Let me see.

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which equals ln(2). So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but in our equation, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2), which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = - ln(2). Wait, because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Wait, let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1: it's (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2). So the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But earlier, we have (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2), which equals:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but that would be the same as:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Which, when rearranged, gives ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would match.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me see:

We started with the ratio of (n_i/n_j) being twice as much in star_1 as in star_2, which led us to taking the ratio of their respective Boltzmann factors and setting that equal to 2.

Wait, wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me go back.

The ratio given is that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps (n1_i /n1_j) = 2 (n2_i /n2_j). Then, since g_i/g_j is the same for both stars, the equation becomes:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) ) = - ln(2)

Factor ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ] = - ln(2)

Then,

(1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) = [ - ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Plugging in the numbers, since ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, they cancel:

(1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) = [ - ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ] / (1.38e-23 J )

Which simplifies to:

(1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = - ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So equation ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

The problem involves two stars in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice as high in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The goal is to determine the correct relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, T₁ and T₂.

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we have:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into this ratio and canceling \(g_i/g_j\) (which is the same for both stars), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
