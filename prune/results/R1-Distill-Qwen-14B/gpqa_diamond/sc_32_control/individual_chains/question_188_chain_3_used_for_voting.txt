Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * (cos(alpha)) ), but wait, wait. Oh wait, no, that's not right. I think the correct formula when the lattice is rhombohedral is more specific.

Wait, the general formula for a rhombohedral system. Oh right, in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance for plane (hkl) is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk - kl - lh ) multiplied by some factor involving the angles. Or wait, maybe using the cos terms because of the angles.

I think the correct formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k + k l + l h) * (cos θ) ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. In a rhombohedral crystal, all angles are the same, which is 30 degrees here.

So, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1. So let's plug into the formula.

First, calculate the numerator: a is 10 Angstroms.

Denominator: sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) - (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos(30°) )

Let's compute each part:

Sum of squares: 1+1+1 = 3.

Sum of products: 1*1 + 1*1 +1*1 = 3.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3 * cos(30°)).

What's cos(30°)? It's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 * cos(30) = 3 * 0.8660 ≈ 2.598.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 2.598 = 0.402.

Then the denominator is sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.77? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstroms. Hmm, I must have messed up the formula.

Wait a minute, maybe I got the formula wrong. Because in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) cosθ ) * something else?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Miller indices and the relation in a rhombohedral lattice, which can sometimes be treated as a special case of a hexagonal or cubic system. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used isn't correct for this case.

Let me think again. Oh, wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral lattice can be written as d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (h k +k l +l h) * cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, but the calculation led to d ≈15.77, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is actually d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (h k +k l +l h) * cos α ), but perhaps for a rhombohedral system, the formula is different when the angles are not 90 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation involving the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar distance in terms of the metric tensor. The metric tensor approach might be more accurate here.

So, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

a 0 0
0 a 0
0 0 a² (1 + 2 cos α )

Wait, no, I think the metric tensor components for a rhombohedral system are:

Let me recall. The metric tensor (also known as the Gram matrix) for a rhombohedral lattice with lattice vectors a, b, c of equal length a, and angles between each other as α (since all are equal), is:

[ a²         (a²/2)(1 - cos α)   (a²/2)(1 - cos α) ]
[ (a²/2)(1 - cos α)   a²         (a²/2)(1 - cos α) ]
[ (a²/2)(1 - cos α)   (a²/2)(1 - cos α)   a² ]

Wait, but I might be mixing this up. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements are:

h² (a²) + hk (a² cos α) + ... . Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

The interplanar distance is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) * something.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) (cos α)/(a²).

Wait, that's similar to the formula I tried earlier but perhaps missing a factor.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + kl + lh) cos α ]

So 1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + kl + lh) cos α ] / a².

So d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Plugging in numbers: a=10 Angstrom.

Compute denominator inside sqrt: (3) - (3)*cos(30 degrees) = 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 3 - 3*0.8660 ≈ 3 - 2.598 ≈ 0.402.

So sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.77 Angstrom. But the options are all around 9, so I must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding about the lattice parameter 'a'. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, sometimes the lattice parameter is the edge length, but the interatomic distance might be different. Oh wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So in a simple cubic structure, a would be 10 Angstrom, but in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral with angles 30 degrees.

Wait, but wait: perhaps I confused the lattice parameter 'a' with something else. Let me think: in a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice vectors a, b, c all have the same length, say 'a'. The interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure is 'a', but in a rhombohedral structure, the actual interatomic distance along a different direction might be different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is the length of the lattice vectors (so a=10 Angstrom). Because, in a simple cube, the interatomic distance is a.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal. So in a simple cubic structure, a would be 10. But in a rhombohedral structure with angles, the distance between nearest neighbors is not simply a, but perhaps a function of a and the angles.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think: in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length 'a', and the angles between them are 30 degrees. The interatomic distance (nearest neighbor distance) would be along the direction of the lattice vectors, so yes, 'a' is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but in that case, if I proceed with the formula I have, I get d=15.77, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the rhombohedral system as a hexagonal system. Wait, rhombohedral is a special case of hexagonal when the c-axis is equal to a and the angles are 60 degrees, but in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's not hexagonal.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute using the interplanar spacing formula for a hexagonal system. Hmm, but that's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula for interplanar distance:

d = (1/√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2lh cos γ + ... )) * (some factor).

Wait, no, perhaps the general formula for d is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) - (hk + kl + lh) (cos α / a² )

Wait, no, because in a general triclinic system, the formula is more complex. But in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal (α=β=γ), so perhaps the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula d = a / √(h² + k² + l² - hk - kl - lh) * something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me try to re-calculate.

So, denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 3 - 2.598 ≈ 0.402. So sqrt(0.402) is approximately 0.634, as before.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.77. But none of the options are that high. The options are around 9, which is lower than 10. So this suggests that I'm making a big mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again about the Miller indices and the interplanar distance.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral lattice, sometimes the (111) planes can be related to the face diagonals, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, but no, FCC is a cubic system, not rhombohedral. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me check another source. Oh wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h k + k l + l h) * cos θ )

Wait, I think I did that. So maybe the problem is that the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but some other parameter. Oh! Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but the distance between nearest atoms, which could be something else.

Wait, in a rhombohedral lattice, the atoms are at the vertices of the rhombohedron. So the nearest neighbors would be along the edges, so the interatomic distance would be 'a', so a=10 Angstrom.

But then why am I getting a d that's larger than a? Because for (111) planes, the interplanar distance could be larger than the interatomic distance.

Wait, but the options are all less than 10. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the formula uses cos(θ/2) instead of cosθ. Because sometimes in crystallography, angles are defined differently. For example, the angle between the lattice vectors could be 180 - 30=150 degrees, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no. The angle in the formula is the angle between the lattice vectors, which is given as 30 degrees. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the denominator.

Compute 3 - 3 * cos(30°).

cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254.

3 * 0.8660254 ≈ 2.598076.

3 - 2.598076 ≈ 0.401924.

sqrt(0.401924) ≈ 0.634.

So 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.77 Ang.

But the options are way smaller. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula d = a * sqrt(3) / sqrt( (3) - 2*(something) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the formula I should be using is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * (1 + cos α) )

Wait, but that's a guess. Let me try that. Compute denominator:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

sum of squares = 3.

sum of products: 3.

so (3) - 3*(1 + cos 30) → 3 -3*(1.866) → 3 -5.598= -2.598.

Wait, that can't be right. Square root of a negative number? That's impossible, so that formula must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the structure factor or the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the reciprocal basis vectors. The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is h a* +k b* + l c*, where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

But calculating reciprocal vectors might be more complicated, but let's try.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be determined. The reciprocal vectors a*, b*, c* satisfy the condition that their dot product with the original vectors gives delta functions.

But perhaps a better way is to use the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix given by:

g_ij = a² δ_ij + a² (1/2)(1 - δ_ij) cos α

Wait, that's for a rhombohedral lattice where all sides are a, and angles between any two vectors are α.

Wait, more accurately, the metric tensor components (g_ij) are:

g_11 = a²

g_12 = g_13 = (a²/2)(1 - cos α )

g_22 = a²

g_23 = (a²/2)(1 - cos α )

g_33 = a²

Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors have the same magnitude, and each pair has the same angle α.

So the reciprocal lattice vectors (hkl) are given by solving the matrix equation:

( g_ij ) * ( d_i ) = (h^2 δ_ij ... )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector is |G|² = h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + 2hk g_12 + 2hl g_13 + 2kl g_23.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me write it out.

|G|² = h² a² + k² a² + l² a² + 2hk (a²/2)(1 - cos α) + 2hl (a²/2)(1 - cos α) + 2kl (a²/2)(1 - cos α )

Simplify each term:

= a² (h² +k² + l²) + a² (1 - cos α) (hk + hl + kl )

So,

|G|² = a² [ (h² +k² + l²) + (1 - cos α)(hk + hl + kl) ]

The interplanar distance d is given by d = 2π / |G|.

So,

d = 2π / sqrt( a² [ (h² +k² + l²) + (1 - cos α)(hk + hl + kl) ] )

But wait, the interplanar distance formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) f + ... ), but perhaps I'm confusing the reciprocal vectors. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = 1 / |G|, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think again. The interplanar spacing is given by d = 1 / |G|, where |G| is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. So,

d = 1 / |G|.

So,

|G|² = [ (h² +k² +l²) a² + (hk + hl + kl) a² (1 - cos α) ]

So,

|G| = a sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + (hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos α) )

So,

d = 1 / [ a sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + (hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos α) ) ]

Wait, but that's different from what I had before. Let me plug in h=k=l=1, a=10, alpha=30 degrees.

Compute the terms:

h² +k² +l² =3.

hk + hl + kl=3.

1 - cos(30) = 1 - 0.8660 ≈ 0.13397.

So,

Inside the sqrt: 3 + 3 * 0.13397 ≈ 3 + 0.4019 ≈ 3.4019.

sqrt(3.4019) ≈ 1.8444.

So,

d = 1/(10 * 1.8444) ≈ 1/(18.444) ≈ 0.0542 Angstrom^{-1} ?

Wait, that makes no sense. Wait, no, units. Because |G| is in reciprocal Angstroms, so d is in Angstroms.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the reciprocal. Let me double-check.

Wait, |G| is the magnitude of the reciprocal vector, so d = 1/|G|.

So, |G| = a * sqrt( ... ), so d = 1/(a * sqrt( ... )).

So,

d = 1/(10 * sqrt(3.4019)) ≈ 1/(10 *1.8444) ≈ 1/18.444 ≈ 0.0542 Angstrom?

That can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstrom. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure factor, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes may form a hexagonal pattern, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using the Miller indices and the unit cell vectors.

Let me define the lattice vectors a, b, c, each of length a=10 Angstrom, and the angles between them as 30 degrees.

The unit cell vectors can be represented as:

a = a i

b = a j

c = a [ (k) i + (l) j + (m) k ]

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model the vectors in terms of a cube but with angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a cube with each vector making 30 degrees with each other.

But perhaps the better approach is to model the vectors as vectors in 3D space. For a rhombohedral lattice, all vectors a, b, c have the same magnitude, and the angles between any two are 30 degrees.

So, to find the interplanar distance for (111), we can use the formula:

1/d² = (h a_x + k b_x + l c_x)^2 + (h a_y + k b_y + l c_y)^2 + (h a_z + k b_z + l c_z)^2 )

But I'm not sure about the exact vectors. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula involving the metric tensor.

Wait, the formula I should be using is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) * (1 + (cos α)/ ... )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from the metric tensor approach.

The metric tensor is:

g = [ a²  (a²/2)(1 - cos α)   (a²/2)(1 - cos α) ]
    [ (a²/2)(1 - cos α)   a²        (a²/2)(1 - cos α) ]
    [ (a²/2)(1 - cos α)   (a²/2)(1 - cos α)    a²      ]

Then, the reciprocal of the metric tensor gives the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + ... ), but I'm not exactly recalling it.

Alternatively, the formula for the reciprocal metric tensor (g*) is the inverse of g. The components of g* are used to compute the reciprocal vectors.

The interplanar distance is given by d = sqrt( g*_{11} h² + g*_{22} k² + g*_{33} l² + 2 g*_{12} hk + 2 g*_{13} hl + 2 g*_{23} kl ) )

Wait, no, I think it's:

The magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector is (h, k, l) multiplied by g, then multiplied by (h, k, l)^T, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

|G|² = h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + 2hk g_12 + 2hl g_13 + 2kl g_23.

So, for our case, h=k=l=1.

g_11 = a² = 100 (since a=10).

g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = (a²/2)(1 - cos α) = (100/2)(1 - 0.8660) ≈ 50*(0.13397) ≈ 6.6985.

So,

|G|² = 1² * 100 + 1² * 100 + 1² * 100 + 2*1*1*6.6985 + 2*1*1*6.6985 + 2*1*1*6.6985.

So,

= 300 + (6.6985)*6 → because 2*1*1*6.6985 is 13.397, and there are three such terms.

Wait, no. Let me recompute:

Each of the cross terms (g_12, g_13, g_23) is 6.6985.

So,

|G|² = 100 (for h²) + 100 (k²) + 100 (l²) + 2*1*1*6.6985 (hk) + 2*1*1*6.6985 (hl) + 2*1*1*6.6985 (kl)

So,

= 300 + 3*(2 * 6.6985) → 300 + 3*(13.397) → 300 + 40.191 = 340.191.

So, |G| = sqrt(340.191) ≈ 18.444.

Then, d = 1 / |G| = 1/18.444 ≈ 0.0542 Angstrom^{-1}.

Wait, but d should be in Angstroms, right? Because |G| is in reciprocal Angstroms, so d is in Angstroms.

Wait, no: |G| is in reciprocal Angstroms, so when you take 1/|G|, you get Angstroms.

Wait, so 1/18.444 ≈ 0.0542 Angstrom? That can't be right because the options are about 9 Angstrom.

Wait, this can't be. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the metric tensor's components instead. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute g* (the inverse of g) and then compute |G|.

Wait, the metric tensor g is:

100   6.6985   6.6985
6.6985  100    6.6985
6.6985  6.6985  100

So, to find the reciprocal (g inverse), perhaps I can compute it.

But inverting a 3x3 matrix might be time-consuming, but I can proceed.

Let me denote the matrix as:

g = [ [100, 6.6985, 6.6985],
       [6.6985,100,6.6985],
       [6.6985,6.6985,100] ]

The determinant of g would be needed, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or use symmetry.

But perhaps I should think differently. The reciprocal of the metric tensor (g*) is such that g * g* = Identity.

Alternatively, perhaps the diagonal terms of g* can be found using the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 matrix with diagonal a and off-diagonal b, which is a special case.

In this case, the matrix g is:

g_11 = g_22 = g_33 = a² = 100,

g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = b = (a²/2)(1 - cos α) ≈ 6.6985.

The inverse of such a matrix is known. For a matrix where all diagonal elements are equal to A and all off-diagonal elements are equal to B, the inverse can be written as:

[ (1/(A - B*(n-1)))   (-B)/(A - B*(n-1))   ... ]

But in this case, n=3, so:

The determinant of g is (A - B)^2 (A + 2B).

Wait, for a 3x3 matrix with diagonal A and off-diagonal B, the determinant is (A - B)^2 (A + 2B).

So, determinant D = (100 - 6.6985)^2 * (100 + 2 *6.6985 )

Compute (100 -6.6985)=93.3015. 93.3015^2 ≈ approx 8705.3.

Compute (100 +13.397)=113.397.

So, D ≈ 8705.3 * 113.397 ≈ let's approximate 8705 * 113 = around 980,  000 (exact calculation needed for accuracy, but perhaps it's around 988,  000).

But perhaps it's easier to proceed with the inverse matrix.

The inverse matrix g* will have elements:

g*11 = (A + 2B) / D,

g*12 = g*13 = -B / D,

Similarly, g*22 = (A + 2B)/D,

g*23 = -B/D,

g*33 = (A + 2B)/D.

So,

g*11 = g*22 = g*33 = (100 + 2*6.6985) / D.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the elements using the formula for the inverse.

But perhaps this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a pattern.

But I think I'm stuck. Another approach: Perhaps the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Angstrom.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I should try a different formula. Let me think about the conventional formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * cosθ )

Earlier, I computed this as 10 / sqrt(0.402) ≈15.77, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * (1 + cosθ) )

Wait, let me try that.

Compute denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 3*(1 + 0.8660 )= 3 - 3*(1.866) = 3 -5.598= -2.598. That's negative, which is impossible.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the formula involves the reciprocal of the sum of squares. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Another angle: perhaps I should think in terms of the vectors. The (111) plane is given by the vector sum a + b + c.

The interplanar distance is the magnitude of this vector divided by sqrt(3) if all vectors are the same length and angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, but that approach might not be correct. Let me think.

The vector for the (111) plane is a + b + c.

The magnitude of this vector is |a + b + c|.

Each of a, b, c has magnitude 10 Angstrom.

The angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees.

So, |a + b + c|² = |a|² + |b|² + |c|² + 2(a·b + a·c + b·c )

= 10² +10² +10² + 2*(10*10*cos30 + 10*10*cos30 +10*10*cos30 )

= 300 + 2*(3 * 100 * 0.8660 )

= 300 + 2* 3* 86.60

= 300 + 2*259.8

= 300 + 519.6 = 819.6.

So |a + b + c| = sqrt(819.6) ≈ 28.63 Angstrom.

But the interplanar distance is not this; it's the distance between adjacent (111) planes, which is the magnitude of this vector divided by the number of unit cells along that direction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance d is |a + b + c| / sqrt(3), since the (111) plane corresponds to three directions.

Wait, |a + b + c|=28.63, so sqrt(3)=1.732.

d ≈ 28.63 / 1.732 ≈ 16.53 Ang. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the initial formula I used was correct, but the interatomic distance 'a' is not 10 Angstrom. Maybe the interatomic distance is not 'a' but a different parameter. Because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is larger, so 'a' might be different from the nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps 'a' in the formula is the nearest neighbor distance, but in a rhombohedral system, the edge length 'a' is not the same as the nearest neighbor distance. Hmm, but in a cubic system, 'a' is the edge length and the nearest neighbor distance. In a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor might be along a different direction.

Wait, maybe I should compute the distance between nearest neighbors. In a rhombohedral lattice, the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so their distance is 'a', which is given as 10. So 'a' is 10.

But then, why am I getting a d of around 15.77, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d = [ a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) cosθ ) ]

But perhaps for a rhombohedral system with angles 30 degrees, the actual formula uses cos(60) instead of cos(30). Or perhaps it's sin.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(180-30)=cos(150), which is -sqrt(3)/2. Let me try that.

So cosθ = cos(150) = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.8660.

So denominator is 3 - 3*(-0.8660) = 3 +2.598 = 5.598.

sqrt(5.598)≈2.366.

d=10/2.366≈4.225 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + kl + lh) cosθ )

Wait, let me try that.

Denominator: 3 + 3*(0.8660)= 3 +2.598=5.598.

sqrt(5.598)≈2.366.

d= 10/2.366≈4.225 Ang. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + kl + lh) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, for our case, 3 +3*(1 - 0.866)=3 +3*(0.134)=3+0.402=3.402.

sqrt(3.402)=1.844.

d=10 /1.844≈5.42 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Angstrom, but I can't see how to get that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ )

Wait, let's try with h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 + 3*(2*0.866) = 3 + 5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Ang. Not matching.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps I should look for the formula in a reference.

Wait, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + kl + lh) * cos α )

Which is what I used earlier, leading to d=15.77. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the question refers to a different kind of interplanar distance or perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me re-calculate the denominator:

3 -3 * cos(30) =3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈3 - 2.598 ≈0.402.

sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

10 /0.634 ≈15.77.

Hmm. So I must be using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Let me try that.

Denominator:3 +3*0.866≈3+2.598≈5.598.

sqrt(5.598)=2.366.

d=10/2.366≈4.225 Ang. Still not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + kl + lh) )

In this case, denominator is 3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 Ang. No match.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + kl + lh) (1 - cos α) )

Which would be 3 +3*(0.134)=3+0.402=3.402.

sqrt(3.402)=1.844.

d=10/1.844≈5.42 Ang.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess. But I don't see any option close to 15.77. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstrom.

Wait, how would I get 8.95? Let's see.

Assume d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + kl + lh) * (cos α) )

Wait, but that gives 15.77. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Let me try that.

Denominator:3 - 2*3*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should use another formula. Another thought: the interplanar distance for (111) in a cubic system is a / sqrt(3), which is about 5.77 Angstroms if a=10. But here, it's a rhombohedral system, so the distance should be different.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) ) * something.

Wait, I'm stuck. Another approach: perhaps the answer is option C, 9.54 Ang.

Wait, but how? Let me think of 10*0.954=9.54. So perhaps the denominator is about 1.048.

Wait, sqrt( (3) -3 * cos30 )=sqrt(0.402)=0.634. 10/0.634≈15.77. How does 9.54 come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Miller indices differently. Wait, maybe the plane is (1,1,1), but perhaps the formula uses a different approach, like the face-centered cubic approach, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * (sqrt(3)) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) )

Wait, for h=k=l=1,

denominator is 3-3=0. So that's undefined. So no.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the options, and the calculations I've done, I'd say perhaps the correct formula leads to option B) 8.95 Angstrom. But I can't see how.

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula uses the angles as 60 degrees instead of 30? Because sometimes the angle between the lattice vectors is defined as 60 degrees, leading to a different calculation.

Wait, but the question states the angles are 30 degrees. So that's not applicable.

Another idea: perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle, 180-30=150 degrees. So cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator:3 -3*(-0.866) =3 +2.598=5.598.

sqrt(5.598)=2.366.

d=10/2.366≈4.225 Ang. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. Since none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 9.54 Ang, which is close to 10. So perhaps the answer is option C, but I can't see how to get it.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should use the formula d = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) * something.

Wait, for (111), h² +k² +l²=3. So sqrt(3)≈1.732.

So 10/1.732≈5.77 Ang. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) * (1 - (cos alpha)/something) )

But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the given angles are all 30 degrees, which makes it a special case. Maybe for a rhombohedral system with alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, the interplanar distance formula simplifies.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * (2 cos alpha) )

In that case, denominator would be 3 -3*2*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Again, impossible.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the earlier calculation and see if it's possible that the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Ang.

Wait, but I can't see how to get that number. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + kl + lh) * cos alpha )

Which gives denominator 5.598, d=10/2.366≈4.225. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08. Let me see.

If d=9.08, then denominator is 10/9.08≈1.101.

So sqrt( ... )=1.101.

So inside sqrt: (3 - 3 cos30)=0.402. But 1.101 squared is 1.212, which is much larger than 0.402. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

I think I'm stuck and will have to make a guess. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Ang.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) \cos \alpha}}
\]

### Step 1: Substitute the given values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \). Substituting these values:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
\]
\[
hk + kl + lh = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 3
\]
\[
\cos \alpha = \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
The denominator inside the square root is:
\[
(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) \cos \alpha = 3 - 3 \cdot 0.866 = 3 - 2.598 = 0.402
\]

Thus:
\[
\sqrt{0.402} \approx 0.634
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( d \)
Using the formula for \( d \):
\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{0.402}} = \frac{10}{0.634} \approx 15.77 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( d \approx 15.77 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all significantly smaller (around 9–10 Å). This suggests that either the formula used or the interpretation of the given parameters might be incorrect. However, based on the options provided, the closest plausible answer is **B) 8.95 Å**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.
