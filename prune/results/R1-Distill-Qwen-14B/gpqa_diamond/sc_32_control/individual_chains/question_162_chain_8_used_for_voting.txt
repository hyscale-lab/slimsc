Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric in 2D. The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, I remember that in such cases, the area element can be found by integrating the determinant of the metric. But wait, since it's 2D, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. For a metric in the form ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the determinant is f squared, so the area element is f dx dy.

So in this case, f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, what's the domain of this metric? Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which means the metric blows up when x² + y² approaches 4. So the space is defined where 4 - x² - y² is positive, meaning inside the circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane. Because if x² + y² <4, then the denominator is positive. If it's greater, the denominator becomes negative, but the metric would have an imaginary component, which isn't physical, so the space is probably the region where x² + y² <4.

So the space looks like a disk of radius 2, but with a conformal factor that makes the area element larger as you approach the edge (since f increases as x² + y² approaches 4).

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, wait! I think I'm getting confused. Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y coordinates, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, wait, pseudosphere is a term used in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, in 2D, the pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Wait, but in this case, the metric is 2-dimensional, so perhaps it's representing a space with some curvature.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is in 3D, but no, the question seems to be 2-dimensional because the metric is written in dx² + dy². So perhaps this is a 2D space with a certain geometry, and the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere (which, in 2D, would just be a circle with some properties) but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I'm supposed to find the area of this pseudosphere using the given metric.

Wait, but pseudosphere is a term I'm a bit fuzzy on. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature, right? Like the tractricoid. So the metric given might describe such a surface.

But wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y, but the metric's form is f(x,y)(dx² + dy²). So maybe it's a way to parameterize the pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. Maybe the given metric is that of a pseudosphere, and we're to compute its area.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is 4πr², but wait, no. Wait, the tractricoid is a surface of constant negative curvature, but the area is actually infinite? Because the tractricoid is a complete surface with finite area but infinite extent? Hmm, no, I think the tractricoid is a finite surface. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: in 2D hyperbolic space, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π times (cosh(r) -1). But if r is 2, then it would be 2π( cosh(2) - 1 ). But wait, that's in the Poincaré disk model, but I'm not sure how that relates here.

Wait, but the given metric is in 2D, and the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a 2D surface. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a 2D hyperbolic space, which has an infinite area.

Wait, but the given metric is conformally flat. The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. To find the total area, I would integrate this over the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0, which is the disk of radius 2. So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, that seems like a standard integral. Let me try to compute it. Switching to polar coordinates would make sense, since x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫(θ from 0 to 2π) ∫(r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Factor out the constants: 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So the area is 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -(du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ 1/u ] * (-du/2 ). The negative sign reverses the limits:

= (1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2)(ln u) evaluated from 0 to 4. But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm, that suggests the integral diverges. But that can't be, because our original region is up to r=2 where the denominator is 4 - r²=0, but r=2 is the upper limit.

Wait, no, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand approaches infinity. So the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr becomes ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try another approach. Let me write the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me note that 4 - r² = -(r² -4), so the denominator is negative when r <2, but in our case, r is from 0 to 2, so 4 - r² is positive.

Wait, but the substitution u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ (r dr) / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du. 

Which is (-1/2) ln |u| + C. But since u is positive in our interval, we can drop the absolute value.

So the integral from r=0 to r=2 is:

At r=2, u=0; at r=0, u=4. So substituting:

Integral = [ (-1/2)(ln u) ] from 4 to 0.

Which is [ (-1/2)(ln 0) ) - (-1/2)(ln 4) ) ].

But ln(0) is minus infinity, so this becomes [ (1/2) * infinity ) + (1/2 ln4 ) ].

Wait, that's infinity. So the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr is approaching infinity. Therefore, the area would be 32 * 2π * (infinite) → infinite.

But the options have option D as +∞. So perhaps the area is infinite.

But wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. How can the area be infinite? The region of integration is the disk of radius 2, but the conformal factor is blowing up at the boundary. So the area might indeed be infinite.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere is a finite area surface, isn't it? Or is it? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the tractricoid (pseudosphere) with the hyperbolic plane. Because the hyperbolic plane has infinite area, whereas the tractricoid is a finite surface.

Wait, the tractricoid (pseudosphere) is a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's a finite area surface, right? But if the metric given is for a 2D space, perhaps it's a model of the hyperbolic plane, which extends infinitely and has infinite area.

Wait, but in our case, the metric is defined only for x² + y² <4, which makes it a finite region, but the conformal factor makes the area element diverge as you approach the boundary. So the total area would be infinite.

But wait, another thought: if the metric is given in terms of x and y, but the coordinates are only valid within a certain radius, perhaps that's a compactification. But the integral still diverges.

So, putting it all together, the area is infinite, so the answer is D) +∞.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infinite. So the answer should be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformally flat in 2D. The conformal factor is \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), and the area element is \( dA = f(x, y) \, dx \, dy \). The metric is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) becomes zero at \( r = 2 \) (where \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)) and negative beyond this radius, making the metric singular at \( r = 2 \).

To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Changing limits: \( r = 0 \to u = 4 \), \( r = 2 \to u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| \Big|_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to infinity. Thus, the total area \( A \) is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). While the tractricoid (pseudosphere) is a finite-area surface in some contexts, the given metric describes a 2D space where the area element diverges as \( r \to 2 \). This suggests the space is not compact and has infinite extent, leading to an infinite total area.

From the options provided:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not the total area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not the total area.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area diverges due to the conformal factor.

Thus, the total area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite.

Answer: D
