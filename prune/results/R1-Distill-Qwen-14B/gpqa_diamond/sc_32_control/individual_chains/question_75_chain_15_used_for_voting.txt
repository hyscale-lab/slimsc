Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mice. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The researcher is using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to transfect a plasmid that's supposed to overexpress GADD45G with an HA tag. But when they test the expression, it's not working. They look at the DNA sequence and see that the plus strand starts with ATG (which is the start codon) and ends with TGA. 

Wait, the sequence ends with TGA. Hmm, TGA is a stop codon. Oh, right, stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. So in the mRNA, TGA would be a stop codon. But wait, the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. Let me think about the transcription.

The DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the coding strand but with T replaced by U. So the last part of the mRNA would have UGA. That's a stop codon.

But wait, the construct is supposed to express the GADD45G protein with an HA tag. If the mRNA has a stop codon in the middle, the ribosome would terminate early. So the HA tag is probably at the N-terminus, right? If the stop codon is within the coding sequence, that would cause the protein to be truncated or not made at all. 

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That makes sense because the DNA has a TGA in the middle, which would lead to a premature stop in the mRNA.

What about the other options? Option A talks about a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But the problem didn't mention any issues with the HA sequence; the issue is that the protein isn't being expressed. So maybe the stop codon is the main problem.

Option C is about a linker causing proteolysis. I'm not sure how that would affect expression. The problem is that the protein isn't being made in the first place, not that it's being degraded. Plus, the sequence includes the HA tag, which I don't think is a protease site.

Option D is about the tRNA for UAA not existing. Wait, no, the mRNA has UGA as a stop codon. The tRNA for UAA (which isn't a standard codon) doesn't exist, but the ribosome itself recognizes stop codons without tRNA. So the ribosome would stop at UGA regardless of tRNA availability. So D doesn't seem right.

So the issue is that the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, causing early termination. So the correct answer should be B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an HA tag in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells but observes no successful expression. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand shows that it starts with the start codon ATG and ends with TGA, which is a stop codon in the mRNA (UGA). This premature stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA sequence is unlikely since the issue is the lack of protein expression, not a specific problem with the HA tag.
- **Option B**: The presence of the stop codon (UGA in mRNA) explains why the ribosome terminates translation prematurely, preventing full-length protein expression. This aligns with the observed failure to overexpress the protein.
- **Option C**: A lack of a linker sequence causing proteolysis is not relevant here, as the issue is the absence of protein expression, not degradation.
- **Option D**: The tRNA for UAA is irrelevant because the stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, and stop codons are recognized directly by the ribosome without requiring tRNA.

The root cause of the failure to express the protein is the premature stop codon (UGA) in the mRNA, leading to early ribosome termination. 

Answer: B
