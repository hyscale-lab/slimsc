Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question lists four organic moieties, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each a combination of the four. Let's break them down.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so this is a biphenyl compound. The substituents are on positions 2 and 6 of each benzene ring. Wait, the structure is a biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents are symmetrical, but I'm more concerned about the possibility of a chiral center. So, let me look at the functional groups here. The dicarboxylate groups are on each benzene ring, and they're ester groups (since it's dimethyl). But are there any chiral carbons?

Wait, the central carbon—like where the two benzene rings are connected. No, that's a single bond, so maybe that's a possibility for some kind of isomerism. Oh wait, no, because biphenyls typically don't have a chiral center there. Unless there's a substituent on that carbon. Oh, but in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 (I think that's the positions). Wait, maybe the substitution is such that there's a possibility of the molecule being chiral.

Wait, the molecule is 6,6'-dinitro... so on each benzene ring, the nitro groups are at position 6, and the carboxylate groups are at 2. So the substituents on each ring are in such a way that when looking at the biphenyl, the substituents are arranged symmetrically? Hmm, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so it wouldn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the arrangement leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry, then maybe it's chiral.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe the key is to look for any chiral centers. If any carbon in the molecule is bonded to four different groups, then the molecule can have optical isomers. So, in this case, the ester groups are OMe attached to carbons. Wait, the ester groups are on the benzene rings. The carbons attached to the ester oxygen—so each ester is a methyl ester. So the ester carbonyl would be a carbonyl group, but the carbons adjacent to the oxygen (the OMe) would be connected to the benzene rings.

Wait, maybe the central carbon isn't a chiral center because it's connected to two benzene rings and two other groups. Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so each benzene has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the two benzene rings each have two substituents. So the biphenyl might have a structure where the two substituents on each ring are in such a way that the overall molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it won't have a chiral center. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it could have a chiral center.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about this. Let me think again. The molecule is 6,6'-dinitro, so nitro groups are on the 6 position of each ring, which is the para position relative to the connecting bond between the two rings. The 2,2' positions have the carboxylate groups. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So the substituents on each ring are para to each other. So when you have that arrangement, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical across the axis of the biphenyl, meaning that any substituents would mirror each other. But I'm not entirely certain. I'll tentatively think that this molecule might not exhibit optical isomerism because of symmetry. Wait, but I could be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent makes the structure asymmetric. Hmm. Maybe I should come back to this and check the other options first.

Moving on to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure-wise, propanoate ester with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Let me write that structure. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- as the ester, but wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. No, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. But when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CHOHCOOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is attached to CH3, CHOH (wait, no—wait the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (the 2nd) is connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (up)
- COOCH3 (right)
- And the central carbon is also connected to another CH2? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let's write the structure properly.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is: the carboxylic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified, it's CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (on the same carbon)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and the next CH2 group? Or wait, the central carbon is the second carbon, so its bonds are:

- to the first carbon (CH3)
- to the third carbon (COOCH3)
- to the OH group
- and to the hydrogen. So no, that's four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center because it has four different groups attached. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 does show optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is phenyl. So the structure is two benzene rings connected to a ketone group (C=O). The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, the ketone group is RCOR', so in benzophenone, both R and R' are phenyl. So the carbon structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph

But the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. Also, the central carbon (the one attached to two phenyls and the O) is connected to two identical groups (the two phenyls). So, the central carbon can't be a chiral center because it has two identical substituents. Are there any other chiral centers? The phenyl groups are all attached to the central carbon, but they themselves don't have any substituents that would create a chiral center. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. Wait no, that's not right. Let me think. Maleic acid is the cis-dioic acid, and fumaric acid is the trans-dioic acid. So fumaric acid is trans. So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester of fumaric acid, so the structure is O=C(CH2COOCH3)-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. The structure of fumarate is CH2COO-CH2COO-, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure would be:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for maleic acid? No, wait. No, wait. Let me correct. Maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, where the two carboxylic acids are on adjacent carbons with a double bond. If the double bond is between the two CH groups, then for maleic acid, the two COOH groups are on the same side (cis), and for fumaric acid, they are on opposite sides (trans). Wait, no, wait. Actually, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH with the two COOCH3 groups on each CH2. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that would be if the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, where the double bond is in the middle. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH(COOCH3), but wait, no, because the double bond is between the two carbons, each bearing a COOCH3 group. So the structure is O=C(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O-OCH3?

No, that's not right. Let's think of it as:

The fumarate ion has a structure where the two carboxylate groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the ester would have two ester groups on each end of the double bond.

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond? No, wait, no, because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and two ester groups on adjacent carbons. So the structure is something like CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of it as the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO2C-CH=CH-COOH.

So when esterified, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is O
           ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2-O-C-OCH3?
Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2-O-C-OCH3?

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O
           ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CH2-O-C-OCH3?

No, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps I can think about whether this molecule has any stereocenters or geometric isomerism.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

In the structure of fumarate, each of the two central carbons (the ones with the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, but that's if it's in a certain configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the carbons are each connected to a COOCH3, a CH2 group, and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps each of the two central carbons (connected by the double bond) has two identical groups. Let me imagine the structure as:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
       |
       COOCH3

Wait, no, that would be a single bond. Alternatively, with a double bond:

COOCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, but that's not possible because each C in the double bond can't have two COOCH3 groups. Oh wait, perhaps each C in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that would be a single bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid has a double bond between the two central carbons, each of which has a carboxylic acid group. So the di-ester would have two ester groups on each of the central carbons.

So the structure is O
           ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
       |
       O-C-OCH3
But wait, that's a single bond; that can't be right. Alternatively, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2-O-C-OCH3

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

COOCH3
|
C=CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, that can't be right because each C in the double bond can't have a COOCH3 and something else. Maybe each of the two central carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So the structure would be:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that would be CH2=CH, which would be a double bond between two CH2 groups, each bearing a COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make each of the two central carbons have two CH2 groups, a COOCH3, and the double bond. So each would be CH2 connected to COOCH3, with a double bond between them. So each of the central carbons has two identical substituents (the CH2 groups), so they wouldn't be chiral centers. Because a chiral center needs four different groups.

Wait, so each of the two central carbons in the double bond here has:

- two CH2 groups (from the same carbon?), but no, wait, each has a CH2 group attached to the COOCH3 and a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps each of those carbons has:

- COOCH3
- two CH2 groups (but that's impossible because each carbon can only have four bonds). Wait, maybe the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond. Oh, but wait, in fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but regardless of that, each of the carbons in the double bond would be attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, for example, one carbon is attached to COOCH3, CH2, and two other substituents. Wait, maybe each carbon has:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (from adjacent)
- and two H's?

Wait, perhaps each carbon is CH2(COOCH3), connected via a double bond. So each carbon would have:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (as a substituent)
- and two H's?

Wait, but then each carbon would have two H's, a CH2 group, and a COOCH3 group. But for a chiral center, you need four different groups. So if a carbon has two H's, it can't be a chiral center because two substituents are identical.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. Since fumarate is a trans diacid, when esterified, does that lead to any chiral centers?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not correct because that would be a single bond. Alternatively, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

So, each of those carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (the adjacent carbon)
- and two H's.

Wait, but that would mean each has two H's, so they can't be chiral centers. Unless the substituents are arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me think about the structure again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So each has:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (from the adjacent carbon)
- and two H's.

Wait, but that can't be because a double bond requires each carbon to have two substituents besides the double bond. So each C in the double bond is bonded to two other groups besides the double bond. So, for example, one C has COOCH3 and CH2, the other has COOCH3 and CH2 as well. Wait, but that would mean each C has the same substituents as the other, so they wouldn't be chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps each C is connected to different substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as:

The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond. But no, fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would be a single bond, which is maleate.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is trans. So the structure would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Now, each of the CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each carbon in the double bond has:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- and two H's.

Wait, but that would mean each C has two H's, so they can't be chiral centers. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, wait. Another possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, since the substituents are on opposite sides, but perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but another thought: in some cases, even if the individual carbons in the double bond aren't chiral centers, the molecule as a whole can have a plane of symmetry. If that's the case, then the molecule itself is achiral. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: could the molecule have a center of symmetry? If the substituents are mirror images across the double bond, then it might be a meso compound, which is achiral despite having stereogenic centers.

Wait, but if each of the two carbons in the double bond is a stereogenic center, but they are mirror images of each other, the molecule would be a meso compound and thus achiral. So for example, if each has two identical substituents, but the arrangement is such that the overall molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound.

Wait, so if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical, then perhaps it's a meso compound. So, for example, if the structure is symmetric across the double bond, then the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two chiral centers but is achiral because of a plane of symmetry. So maybe dimethyl fumarate is similar.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (like two COOCH3 and two CH2 groups), then each carbon would have two identical substituents, so they can't be chiral centers. Thus, the molecule would not have any chiral centers and thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, that can't be right because the ester groups are on opposite sides, but perhaps each carbon isn't a chiral center. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have chiral centers. Let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group, a CH2 group, and two H's. So each has two H's, which are same, so they can't be chiral centers. So, no, no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: look up the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Wait, I can't look it up, but let me think again. The structure of fumarate is trans-butenedioic acid. So the ester would have the structure where each of the two central carbons (each connected to the double bond) has a COOCH3 group.

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Each of the two CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each has:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- and two H's.

So each C has two H's, so they can't be chiral centers. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would be achiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, creating a plane of symmetry in the molecule. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, putting this all together:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I thought earlier that perhaps it doesn't have a chiral center due to symmetry, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should reevaluate. Let's think: the molecule has two benzene rings connected by a single bond, each with nitro groups at 6 and carboxylate groups at 2. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, would the overall molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the arrangement is such that the substituents are mirror images, then it might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents lead to a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl group can rotate. In that case, even if the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule can rotate to become identical to its mirror image, making it achiral. But wait, in some cases, the rotation is restricted, leading to different isomers. But in this case, the substituents are at specific positions. Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral due to the arrangement of the substituents. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would have a chiral center. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings), but in this case, that carbon is connected to two benzene rings, a nitro group, and a carboxylate group. Wait, no, the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is connected to two benzene rings and the substituents on each ring. Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is on the benzene ring, not directly on the connecting carbon.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether the biphenyl compound has any chiral centers. If any of the carbons attached to the rings has four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

In the molecule, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each substituent is attached to a benzene ring, which is attached to the central carbon. So, for example, the carboxylate group on each ring is attached to the benzene, which is attached to the central carbon. So, the substituents are on the benzene, not on the central carbon. So, perhaps the central carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, the substituents are on the ring, which is connected to the central carbon. So, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents (like nitro groups)? Or perhaps the nitro and carboxylate groups are para to each other on the benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions, which are para to each other. So, perhaps each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has two substituents at para positions. Then, looking at the biphenyl structure, each ring has substituents on opposite sides. So, the arrangement might create a symmetrical molecule, making it achiral. Or it might not.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. I'm not entirely certain, but perhaps the biphenyl compound in option 1 has a chiral center, making it exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not confident. Let me try to decide. Suppose the molecule is symmetrical, then it's achiral. If it's not symmetrical, it's chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So, each ring is substituted in such a way that the substituents are in para positions. So, when you have two rings connected by a single bond, with each ring having substituents in para positions, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that rotating the molecule 180 degrees around the central bond leaves it unchanged, then it's symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that they don't mirror each other, then the molecule might be chiral. But in this case, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral.

In conclusion, option 1's molecule might not exhibit optical isomerism because of symmetry.

So, to recap:

1. Probably doesn't exhibit optical isomerism (if symmetrical)
2. Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center)
3. Doesn't exhibit optical isomerism (no chiral centers)
4. Earlier thought: doesn't exhibit, but now unsure.

Wait, but another thought: dimethyl fumarate. If each of the two central carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2, then each would have two identical substituents (H's), so they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, which of the four have optical isomerism?

Option 2: yes.

Option 1: maybe no.

Option 4: no.

So, looking back at the options:

The question is which of the four moieties show optical isomerism.

So, let's list which ones do:

1: ?

2: yes

3: no

4: no.

So the only one we've confirmed so far is option 2.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. Suppose the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Are there any other carbons in the molecule besides the central carbon and the rings?

The molecule is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The carboxylate is OMe, so each ring has two substituents. Are any of the carbons in the rings chiral centers?

Wait, the rings themselves are sp² hybridized, so their carbons can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. The only other carbons are in the ester groups.

Each ester group is OMe attached to the ring. So, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so not a chiral center. The ester oxygen is connected to the ring and to a methyl group. But that's not a chiral center either.

Wait, but perhaps the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is a chiral center. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the central carbon has four different groups, then it would be a chiral center.

Wait, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents? Or is it connected to two benzene rings and the rest being substituents on the rings.

Wait, the structure is biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected at a single carbon. So, the central carbon is attached to two benzene rings and two other groups. But in this case, the substituents are on the benzene rings, not directly on the central carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to each ring and has other substituents. Hmm, maybe not. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral. For instance, if the two rings have substituents arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to it being chiral, even without a chiral center.

Wait, but I think that requires the molecule to have a center of chirality, which is possible in some cases. For example, a molecule can be chiral without a chiral center, but that's more common in larger molecules with certain arrangements. But in this case, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the two rings mirror each other, leading to a plane of symmetry.

I think I'm stuck on whether option 1 is chiral. Let me try to think of an example. Biphenyl compounds can be chiral if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically around the central atom. For example, 1,2-dimethylbiphenyl can be chiral if the substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, in the case of 1,1'-biphenyl, if each ring has substituents at certain positions, the molecule could be chiral. For example, if each ring has a substituent at position 2, and they are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has two substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring has substituents at para positions, which might lead to symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, among the four, only option 2 does. But looking back at the options given:

Options are A) 1, 2,4; B) 3 and4; C)2 and3; D)1 and2.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 has optical isomerism. But that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2.

Hmm, none of the options say only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps option 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has four different substituents. Let me reevaluate.

Each C in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group (from adjacent)
- and two H's.

Wait, but that would make two substituents as H, which are identical. So each C has two H's, so they can't be chiral centers. So no, no chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, based on this, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking back at the options:

The options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me double-check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2.

So, none of the options have only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of option 4.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere. Maybe in the ester groups. Let me think. The ester groups are OMe attached to the carbonyl, so the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded, so not a chiral center. The adjacent carbons are CH2, but they're connected to the ester groups and the double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there's a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think of fumaric acid again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. No, wait. Fumaric acid has a double bond between the two middle carbons. So the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, each of the two CH groups in the double bond has substituents attached.

Each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (from the adjacent carbon)
- two H's.

Wait, so each CH has two H's, making them unable to be chiral centers. So, no chiral centers in option 4. Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the original analysis: only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is options A and D. Since option A includes 1,2,4, but I thought 1 and 4 don't, perhaps only 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option with just 2. So perhaps I made a mistake with option 4.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule in option4 has a geometric isomerism but no optical isomerism. But the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chiral centers, not geometric isomerism.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in assessing option 1.

Let me think again about option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on the benzene rings are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical, it could be chiral.

Imagine that each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Looking at the biphenyl structure, the arrangement of these substituents could lead to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the two rings are mirror images of each other, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So the arrangement on each ring is symmetric, but when connected to the other ring, perhaps the overall structure becomes symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it achiral. So, the nitro and carboxylate groups are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, leading to no optical isomerism.

So, option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct option is 2.

But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4) because option 4 does exhibit optical isomerism. But why?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center somewhere else. Let me think again about its structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the structure. Let me think of it as (E)-dimethyl fumarate. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each of the two CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2. So each carbon in the double bond has:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- two H's.

So, each has two identical substituents (H's), so not chiral centers.

But wait, perhaps the molecule has a different structure. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but each of the carbons in the double bond has two different substituents besides the double bond. For example:

One carbon has COOCH3 and CH2, and the other has COOCH3 and CH2. Wait, but that would mean each has two substituents that are the same (CH2), so no, they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck and should instead look for another approach. Another way to think: which of these compounds have chiral centers.

1. Biphenyl compound: no chiral centers due to symmetry.

2. 2-hydroxypropanoate: yes.

3. Benzophenone: no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no.

So, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is not listed. But that can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe option 4 has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the ester groups are attached to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the central carbons are attached to a chiral center. Let me think: in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So, perhaps each of the two central carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group, a CH2 group, and two H's. So, they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the central carbons in the double bond have four different substituents. Let me write the structure again: CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

The two CH in the double bond are each attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- and two H's.

Wait, that's three substituents. Wait, no, each C in the double bond is connected to two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, no, each C in a double bond has two substituents (like in CH2=CH).

In this case, each C in the double bond is connected to:

- CH2 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and two H's.

So, each C has four substituents: CH2, COOCH3, and two H's. But since two substituents are H's, they're identical, so each C isn't a chiral center.

Thus, again, option 4 doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm. So the only correct answer is option 2, but that's not an option in the multiple-choice. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 1. Let me think again. Suppose the central carbon in the biphenyl structure is a chiral center.

The structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], meaning the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 position. So, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings. But each benzene ring has substituents at the 2 and 6 positions.

So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, the two rings are each substituted in the same way. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Thus, option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, I'm back to the initial conclusion that only option 2 does. But since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option 4 does have a chiral center. Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is (Z), but that would be maleic anhydride. No, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each of the two central carbons in the double bond has different substituents. For example, one has COOCH3 and CH2, and the other has COOCH3 and CH2. No, that's the same as before.

Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a stereogenic center elsewhere, like in the ester groups. But the ester groups are OMe, which are attached to carbons that are double-bonded to O, so they can't be chiral centers.

Thus, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps option 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a molecule has a double bond, the configuration around it can lead to different isomers, but not necessarily chiral centers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But based on my analysis, only 2 is correct. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that only option 2 is correct, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer includes option 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate option 4.

Wait, another approach: look for any centers where four different groups are attached.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- and two H's.

No, so no chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of tartaric acid as a comparison. The meso form has two chiral centers but is achiral because of a plane of symmetry.

Similarly, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, but that would require the presence of chiral centers that are mirror images. But in this case, I don't think the carbons in the double bond are chiral centers.

Thus, I think I've exhausted my options. Based on my analysis, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion that only option 2 is correct, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1, 2, 4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that each of the two central carbons in the double bond has four different substituents. For example, one has COOCH3, CH2, and two different substituents, but I don't think that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that would be a single bond, making it a different compound. No, because fumarate has a double bond.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the initial analysis, the only correct answer is option 2. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, then each carbon in the double bond has three substituents: COOCH3, CH2, and H. So, each C has four substituents. Wait, no, that's three substituents because of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too confused. Let me try to make a decision.

Based on the analysis:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

Thus, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option1. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

In that case, option1 would have optical isomerism. So, options D (1 and 2) would be correct.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate. Another approach: which of these have any possibility of a chiral center.

Option 1: possible chiral center at the central carbon if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. But if the substituents are symmetrically placed, no.

Option 2: definitely a chiral center.

Option 3: no.

Option4: no.

So, the only correct ones are 1 and 2 if 1 has a chiral center, or just 2 otherwise.

But I'm not certain about option 1.

An alternative approach is to think about the actual structures.

The correct answer is likely option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4). But I can't see why 1 and 4 would have optical isomerism.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the biphenyl in option 1 is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the central carbon a chiral center, then it would have optical isomerism.

But in the given compound, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring has two substituents para to each other.

So, the central carbon would be connected to two benzene rings, each of which has substituents at 2 and 6, and perhaps other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other groups, making it a chiral center.

But earlier analysis suggests that the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the central carbon not a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm forced to conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option for the presence of chiral centers (atoms bonded to four different groups). Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers or a lack of symmetry leading to chirality.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at the 6-position and carboxylate groups at the 2-position on each ring. The molecule may have a plane of symmetry due to the symmetrical arrangement of substituents on the benzene rings. If the molecule is symmetrical, it will not exhibit optical isomerism. However, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, it could lack a plane of symmetry and exhibit chirality. Based on the substituent positions, the molecule is likely symmetrical, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CHOH-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, H, and OH. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph is a phenyl group. The central carbon is bonded to two identical phenyl groups and the carbonyl group, meaning it does not have four different substituents. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to a COOCH₃ group, a CH₂ group, and two hydrogens. Since these carbons have two identical substituents (hydrogens), they are not chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- **Option 1**: Likely does not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.  
- **Option 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to a chiral center.  
- **Option 3**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
- **Option 4**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From the analysis, only **Option 2** exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided answer choices include only Option 2. Based on the reasoning, the closest match is **Option A (1, 2, 4)**, though there is uncertainty about Option 1 and Option 4.
