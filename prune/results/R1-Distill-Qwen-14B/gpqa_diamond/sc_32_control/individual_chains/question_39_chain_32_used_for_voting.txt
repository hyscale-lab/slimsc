Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. When they measure the position, none are found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. Hmm, right, because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, wait. The question is about finding the value of 'a'. The options are given. So I need to normalize the wave function because the total probability must be 1. But wait, the wave function given is a bit strange. It's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, okay, so it's a complex function. So the modulus squared will give the probability density.

Wait, but if the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, that seems a bit odd because usually, the wave functions are written in terms of real and imaginary parts, but maybe that's the way it is here. But wait, the wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be 1.

Wait, but the wave function given has two terms. Let me think. No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the given wave function. The given ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Oh, so it's a complex function where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the entire function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x)))] - 0.5i.

But wait, that can't be right. Because if that's the case, ψ(x) would have a real part that depends on x and an imaginary part that's constant. But in reality, for a valid wave function, it's more common for both real and imaginary parts to depend on x. But perhaps that's how it is here. Hmm.

But regardless, to find 'a', I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1. Because outside of that region, the wave function is zero, as per the measurement results. So the integral from 1 to 3 is the total probability, which must be 1.

Let me write down ψ(x) as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i. So the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2, right? Because |ψ|² = (Re ψ)^2 + (Im ψ)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

Wait, but that's because (a / sqrt(1+x)) squared is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5i) squared is (0.5)^2, which is 0.25, but wait, that's not exactly right. Wait, no— when you take the modulus squared of a complex number, it's (real part)^2 plus (imaginary part)^2. So if the imaginary part is -0.5, then (Im ψ)^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but wait a second. If ψ(x) is a linear combination of a real function and a constant imaginary function, that seems a bit unusual, but perhaps it's correct. So the probability density is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 is the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3. And this integral must equal 1.

Let me compute that integral:

Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

I can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral becomes a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So,

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So,

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So 0.5/0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, so that's likely the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the setup?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is correct. So when you calculate |ψ|², it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral is correct.

So integrating from 1 to 3, the integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5)/(ln(2)) ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is option B: 0.85.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is the wave function actually normalized in the region [1,3]? Because the way it's written, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. If that's the case, the integral might not just be a sum of the two terms. Wait, no, the modulus squared is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) exp(-0.5i), but that's a different scenario, but in the problem statement, it's written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, which implies a complex number with real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part (-0.5).

Wait, but wait. If the wave function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, that's correct. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So the modulus squared is [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]².

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave function is written as a function where each term is multiplied by i. But no, the problem states it as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of ψ(x) as (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - (0.5i)), but that's not what the problem says. The problem says (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which suggests that it's a real term plus a constant imaginary term.

But regardless, the way I computed seems correct. So I'll proceed.

Another point to consider: when integrating, the integral is from 1 to 3 because that's where the wave function is non-zero. So yes.

So the conclusion is a ≈ 0.849, so option B is 0.85, which matches.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function. The wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability must equal 1, so we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists, \( x \in [1, 3] \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 1 dx = 1
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 1 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to option \( B \), which is \( 0.85 \). Therefore, the value of \( a \) is:
