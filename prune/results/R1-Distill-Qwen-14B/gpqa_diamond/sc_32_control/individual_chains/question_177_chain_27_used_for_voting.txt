Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through what I know. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, when it comes to luminosity, I remember that mass isn't directly the factor. Oh right, luminosity depends on radius and temperature, not mass. Or maybe the mass relates to temperature somehow? I'm not sure yet, so I'll keep that in mind.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. If the peak wavelengths are the same, then the temperatures must be the same because λ_max would be the same. So T1 = T2. Okay, that's helpful.

Next, the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But since the question is about the actual luminosity, which is intrinsic, not the observed, maybe the Doppler shift isn't directly relevant here. Because luminosity is intrinsic brightness, while observed flux depends on distance and Doppler shifts, but the question is about computed luminosity, so perhaps I can ignore the radial velocities in this calculation. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on blackbody radiation. So perhaps the radial velocities are a red herring, or maybe they affect the calculation of temperature somehow. Hmm, maybe not. Because if they're using spectroscopy to find the peak wavelengths, then the Doppler shift would have already been accounted for, right? Because if a star is moving towards us, its spectrum is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But the problem states that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same, but the actual temperature would be different if they have different radial velocities. Or wait, no. Because if a star is moving towards us (like Star_1 with 0 km/s, maybe it's stationary?), and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then their measured λ_max would be different. But according to the problem, the measured λ_max are the same. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. 

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. But the actual λ_max (as per Wien's law) depends on their temperatures. So if their observed λ_max is same, but one is moving towards us and the other moving away, their actual temperatures would differ. But in our case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, meaning no Doppler shift. Star_2 has 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted. Oh wait, no, because if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, which would make its observed λ_max longer than its actual λ_max. But the problem says the observed λ_max are same. So this might complicate things.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Let me model this. 

Star_1 has radial velocity of 0. So its observed λ_max is λ1_obs = λ1_actual. Star_2 has radial velocity v=700 km/s. Since it's moving away (assuming positive velocity away), the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_actual * (1 + v/c), where c is speed of light. Because when a star moves away, the wavelength is stretched (redshifted). 

But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So λ1_actual = λ2_actual * (1 + v/c). But wait, from the problem, λ1_obs equals λ2_obs. So:

λ1_actual = λ2_actual * (1 + v/c)

But I also know that for blackbody radiation, the actual λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_max = b / T. So for Star_1, λ1_actual = b / T1, and for Star_2, λ2_actual = b / T2. 

So substituting into the first equation:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify, the b's cancel:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, that's interesting. So the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1's? Because when v is positive (moving away), (1 + v/c) is greater than 1. So T2 is higher than T1. Hmm, but I thought the observed λ_max is the same. So the actual maximum emission wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed ones are same. So Star_2 is hotter and moving away, Star_1 is cooler and stationary. Or maybe I got it backwards. Let me think:

Suppose Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ_max is longer. But since λ1_obs equals λ2_obs, that implies that the actual λ2_max is shorter than λ1_max. Because when a star moves away, its observed λ_max is longer than actual. So if observed λ_max is same, then Star_2's actual λ_max must be shorter, making its temperature higher.

So, since λ_max_observed is same, and Star_2 is moving away, its actual λ_max is shorter, so T2 is higher than T1.

But wait, I thought earlier that T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So if v is positive (moving away), then T2 is higher than T1. But that would make Star_2 hotter than Star_1. Hmm, but wait earlier conclusion said that when a star is moving away, observed λ_max is longer. So if Star_2 is moving away, and observed λ_max is same as Star_1's (stationary), then Star_2's actual λ_max must have been shorter, which means T2 is higher.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). But wait, let me check the Doppler shift formula again. The Doppler effect for wavelength is usually given as λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if the source is moving away. So for Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_actual * (1 + v/c). And since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, then λ1_actual = λ2_actual * (1 + v/c). 

Since λ is proportional to 1/T, λ1_actual = (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c). 

Simplifying, T2 = T1 / (1 + v/c). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me re-derive this.

We have:

λ1_obs = λ1_actual = b / T1.

λ2_obs = λ2_actual * (1 + v/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

Given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2/(T1) = (1 + v/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm. Wait, if v is positive (moving away), then (1 + v/c) is bigger than 1, so T2 = T1 * something bigger than 1. So T2 is bigger, meaning Star_2 is hotter.

But wait, let's imagine that Star_2 is moving away. So for its observed λ_max to be the same as Star_1's stationary λ_max, its actual λ_max must be smaller. Because when it's moving away, the observed λ_max is longer. So if λ_obs is same, the actual λ must be smaller. Since λ is inversely proportional to T, that would mean higher T for Star_2. So that makes sense. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). 

But wait, what's the actual value of v? 700 km/s. Let me compute (1 + v/c) since v is much smaller than c (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.0023c). So 1 + 0.0023 is approximately 1.0023. So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0023.

But wait, that's a very small change. So the temperature difference between the two stars is minimal. But wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. Luminosity for a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So the luminosity ratio is (L1/L2) = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But T2 is T1 multiplied by (1 + v/c) which is about 1.0023. So T2 ≈ 1.0023 T1. Let me compute T1^4 / T2^4.

T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / ( (1.0023)^4 ). Let's compute (1.0023)^4.

Using binomial approximation: (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x when x is small.

x = 0.0023, n=4.

(1.0023)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*0.0023 = 1 + 0.0092 = 1.0092.

So 1/(1.0092) ≈ 0.9909.

Wait, but wait, for more accurate calculation, perhaps I should compute (1.0023)^4 precisely.

Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

1.0023 squared is (1 + 0.0023)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0023 + (0.0023)^2 ≈ 1.0046 + 0.00000529 ≈ 1.00460529.

Then square that again: (1.00460529)^2 ≈ 1.009247.

So (T1^4)/(T2^4) = 1/(1.009247) ≈ 0.9908.

So the temperature term is about 0.9908.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9908) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.2278.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.228. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close. Option A is 2.25, which is without considering the temperature difference.

But wait, what's the exact calculation? Because I approximated (1.0023)^4 as 1.009247, but maybe in reality it's a bit different. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's first recheck the setup. Because the radial velocity is 700 km/s for Star_2, but Star_1 has 0. So when computing the Doppler shift, v is 700 km/s. But in the Doppler formula, is it v/c or (v/c) as a fraction, and is it positive or negative?

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)

So for Star_2, moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. But since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, we have:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But wait, no. Because λ_obs for Star_1 is λ1_rest (since v1=0), and λ_obs for Star_2 is λ2_rest * (1 + v/c). And they are equal.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But λ_rest is related to temperature via λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So yes, T2 is higher than T1.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/3e5 )

700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...

So 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, the ratio is T1^4 / T2^4 = [T1^4 ] / [ (T1 * 1.002333 )^4 ] = 1/(1.002333)^4.

Calculating (1.002333)^4.

Let me compute it step by step. Let me compute (1.002333)^2 first.

1.002333^2 = (approx 1.002333 * 1.002333).

Let me compute:

1.002333 * 1.002333:

= (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Now, square that result to get (1.002333)^4.

(1.00467144)^2 = ?

Let me compute 1.00467144 * 1.00467144.

= (1 + 0.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + (0.000021825).

≈ 1.0093647.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093647.

So 1/(1.0093647) = approximately 0.9907.

So the T ratio part is 0.9907.

Now, the L ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/1.0093647).

(1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2275.

Which is approximately 2.2275, so about 2.23. Looking at the options: option D is ~2.23.

But wait, let me think again. Did I correctly calculate (1.002333)^4?

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach: 1.002333^4.

Wait, 1.002333^1 = 1.002333.

1.002333^2 = approximately 1.004666.

1.002333^3 = 1.004666 * 1.002333.

Let me compute 1.004666 * 1.002333.

= 1 * 1.002333 + 0.004666 * 1.002333.

= 1.002333 + 0.004676.

= 1.007009.

Then, 1.007009 * 1.002333 (to get the 4th power).

= 1.007009 * 1.002333.

= approximately 1.007009 * 1.0023 = ?

Wait, 1.007009 * 1.0023:

= (1 + 0.007009) * (1 + 0.0023) = 1 + 0.0023 + 0.007009 + 0.007009 * 0.0023.

= 1.009309 + 0.00001612 ≈ 1.009325.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009325.

So, 1/(1.009325) = approximately 0.9907.

Thus, 2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.227.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.227.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is the closest. So the correct answer is D.

The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their radii, temperatures, and the Doppler effect. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Luminosity Formula**: The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a blackbody, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   Thus, the luminosity ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]

2. **Given Data**:  
   - \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)  
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)  
   - Observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars.

3. **Temperature Relationship**:  
   Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), and the Doppler effect for wavelength, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} (1 + v/c) \), the relationship between the actual temperatures is:  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]  
   Thus, the temperature ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}
   \]

4. **Temperature Term**:  
   The temperature term in the luminosity ratio is:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{(1.002333)^4}
   \]  
   Using a calculator or approximation:  
   \[
   (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009325 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{(1.002333)^4} \approx 0.9907
   \]

5. **Radius Term**:  
   The radius ratio is:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]

6. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   Combining the radius and temperature terms:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:  
   The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **D) ~2.23**.

Answer: D
