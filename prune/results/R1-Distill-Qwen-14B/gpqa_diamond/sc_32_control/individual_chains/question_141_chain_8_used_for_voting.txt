Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d (I think that's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene) with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic substitutions. 

Wait, 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene means the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (bromo), 2 (methyl), and 4 (methyl). Oh wait, wait. Let me draw this structure. So, position 1 is bromo, position 2 is methyl, and position 4 is another methyl. So the ring has substituents at 1, 2, and 4 positions. That would place the methyl groups in the ortho and para positions relative to the bromine.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2, which is a deprotonating agent. I think NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation, maybe elimination, but wait, in aromatic substitution, it's more about deprotonating to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, like a benzene anion. Oh right, like in the formation of a phenide ion. 

So, in an aromatic substitution, when you have a leaving group like bromide attached to benzene, you can have nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Wait, but benzene isn't very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution unless it's activated. Oh wait, but in this case, the substituents are methyl groups. Methyl is an electron-donating group via the inductive effect, which should activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution, but for nucleophilic substitution, usually you need strong activating groups, like -O- or -NH2. 

Wait, but wait. When you have a benzene with a leaving group and a strong base, sometimes elimination can happen. Or maybe dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond? No, that's more aliphatic. Alternatively, maybe a coupling reaction? No, I think NaNH2 is more about deprotonation in certain contexts.

Wait another thought—maybe this is a case of aromatic substitution via a benzyne intermediate. Oh! Benzynes are formed when a dihalobenzene undergoes dehalogenation, but wait, in this case, the molecule has only one bromine. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Oh, perhaps I'm confusing reactions. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a deprotonating agent, maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzynelike structure.

Wait, but only one bromine. Oh wait, maybe it's a ring contraction or expansion? No, that's more for cyclic systems like cyclopropane or something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of elimination. If the base abstracts a proton beta to the bromine, that could form a double bond and eliminate HBr. But wait, we're in an aromatic ring. The positions are 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me). Let's see: the adjacent positions to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 is already a methyl group, so the only possibility is position 6. But wait, position 6 is a hydrogen that's attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. So, the benzene ring has Br in position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl group, so the only possible position for deprotonation adjacent to Br is position 6. So, NaNH2 would abstract a proton from position 6, leading to the formation of a carbanion (a benzene anion) adjacent to the Br.

Wait, but then what happens? The base could abstract a proton adjacent to Br, making a carbanion, which could lead to the elimination of Br- as a leaving group, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2 (since C1 is Br and C2 is adjacent). Wait, no. Because C1 is Br, and C2 is methyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzyne formation. Benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in the benzene ring. But for that, you usually need two leaving groups. Or maybe elimination of HBr from adjacent positions. Oh, perhaps when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the Br leaves, creating a carbene? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a benzannulation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the bromide leaves, and a new substituent is added. But without any other reagents, maybe it's a case of elimination to form a triple bond, but that would require two adjacent leaving groups or some way to form a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of the formation of a benzene diradical or a triple bond. Let me think. If the base abstracts a proton next to Br, then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms. But wait, the adjacent position has a methyl group. So if the base takes a proton from position 6, Br leaves, and we have a triple bond between C1 and C6? But wait, C6 is attached to the ring, but it's a CH that's being deprotonated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism is more like a single elimination, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the reagent NaNH2 in ammonia is used in the Birch reduction? No, Birch uses metals like Na or Li and NH3. Alternatively, in the presence of a base, perhaps it's an elimination to form an alkyne. For example, in alkyne synthesis from dihalides via double elimination.

But in this case, we only have one bromine. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to a coupling. For example, a coupling reaction where the bromide is replaced by a new substituent. But without any other reactants, that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the bromide is deprotonated and forms a benzene anion, which could undergo some kind of attack, but without an electrophile present, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the benzene ring, making a carbanion, which then could attack another electrophilic site, but again, without an electrophile, not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But in aromatic systems, it's not exactly possible to form a double bond since benzene is already fully conjugated. Unless it's a meta director or something else.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, making it more susceptible to attack. But without an incoming nucleophile, that's just the phenide ion.

Wait, in some cases, the phenide ion can undergo various reactions, like ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. The substituents here are methyl groups, which are electron-donating. So, activating the ring for electrophilic substitution but not nucleophilic. Wait, but in some cases, strong bases can perform deprotonation, leading to a ring that's more reactive.

Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are ortho/para directors, but for nucleophilic substitution, activating groups are usually strong electron-donating groups, like -O- or -NH2. Methyl is a weaker activating group and may not be sufficient for nucleophilic substitution.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The reaction is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH2 in ammonia. 

Another thought: Maybe this is a case of a ring contraction or expansion. For example, the base abstracts a proton, leading to a diradical that reorganizes the ring. But I'm not sure about the details.

Wait, wait. I think I remember that when a bromobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination if there's a possibility to form a triple bond, but only if there are two adjacent leaving groups. Wait, no. Oh, but in some cases, like 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the base can abstract a proton from the adjacent carbon, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. That would form a benzyne intermediate, which is a very reactive species.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 4 positions, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 6 (since 1 is Br). But position 2 has a methyl group, so maybe the only possible elimination is from position 6.

Wait, let me visualize the structure. The benzene ring has Br at position 1, methyl at 2, and methyl at 4. So, the positions are as follows: 1 (Br), 2 (Me), 3 (H), 4 (Me), 5 (H), 6 (H). So, the adjacent positions to Br (1) are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl, so the H's are at position 6 and perhaps others.

So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then the Br leaves, and the adjacent C6 would form a triple bond with C1. But C1 was Br, which is leaving, so perhaps the triple bond forms between C1 and C6? That would create a triple bond between C1 and C6, but wait, when a triple bond forms, you lose two H's? Or is it an elimination of the Br and a proton, leading to a triple bond.

Wait, the mechanism would be: deprotonation of position 6, creating a carbanion adjacent to Br. Then, the Br leaves as Br- with two electrons from the C-Br bond, and the carbanion would form a triple bond with the adjacent carbon. So, the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, right? But wait, that would make a structure with a triple bond between 1 and 6. But benzene is a six-membered ring, so a triple bond would make it a very strained structure, but maybe it's a diradical or something else.

Wait, but wait, I'm confusing this with the formation of benzyne. Benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in the ring, which is usually formed from a dihalobenzene undergoing double dehalogenation. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base would lose two HBr's to form a triple bond between C1 and C2.

In our case, we have only one Br. So, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are getting deprotonated. But methyl groups aren't very acidic, are they? The pKa of a benzene ring's hydrogen is around 43-45, while aliphatic protons are around 50 or higher. The methyl groups attached to benzene have even higher pKa because of the electron-donating effect. Wait, so the protons on the ring are more acidic than the methyl's. So, the base NaNH2 (which has a strong base strength, pKa of NH3 is about 38, so the conjugate base is strong) would abstract a ring proton, not the methyl.

So, the base would abstract a hydrogen from the benzene ring, perhaps adjacent to the Br. Let's say it takes a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. Then, the Br would leave, taking two electrons with it—so that's an E2 mechanism, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, but how does that affect the ring structure? That would create a triple bond, and the ring would have a triple bond in it, making it a cyclohexatriyne or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a diradical, which then can combine with another diradical to form a new structure. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: The methyl groups are in positions 2 and 4, so the ring has substituents at 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me). So, when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, that creates a carbanion next to Br. Then, the Br leaves, and the adjacent C (C6) would form a triple bond with C1. 

But wait, the structure would then have a triple bond between C1 and C6, which would leave the ring in a strained state. But perhaps this triple bond would be too unstable, leading to some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens up or forms a new structure.

Wait, but without another substituent, maybe we can't form a diradical. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination but through some other pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a phenide ion. The phenide ion would have a negative charge on the ring. Then, maybe the bromide leaves, and the ring remains as a phenyl anion. But I'm not sure if that would lead to any products.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. But methyl groups are electron-donating, which activate the ring for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So, perhaps the reaction isn't nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, like a Ullmann or something, but I don't think NaNH2 is used for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a new substituent. Wait, but without any other reagent, what would that substituent be? Or maybe the base is acting as a nucleophile. Wait, NaNH2 in ammonia—so the solvent is aq. ammonia, perhaps with NH2- as the nucleophile.

So, if the base abstracts a proton, perhaps the Br leaves, and the NH2- could attack, leading to a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. But that's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but for that to happen, the ring must be activated. If the ring is activated by strong electron-donating groups, then the ring becomes more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The substituents here are methyl groups. Are two methyl groups enough to activate the ring for nucleophilic substitution?

I'm not entirely sure. Methyl groups are weakly activating but ortho/para directing. But in nucleophilic substitution, the ring needs to be strongly activated, like with -O- or -NH2 groups, which are strongly activating. Methyl groups might not be sufficient.

So, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look up common reactions of bromobenzene derivatives with NaNH2. From what I remember, NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in the formation of benzynes. But that typically requires two halogens adjacent to each other. Since this molecule only has one Br, perhaps another elimination isn't possible.

Wait, but maybe this molecule can form a benzynelike structure through some other mechanism. Let's see. If the base abstracts a proton next to Br, then Br leaves, and a triple bond forms. But in this case, the adjacent position has a methyl group, so maybe the only possible proton to abstract is position 6.

So, the process would be:

1. Deprotonation at position 6 by NaNH2, forming a carbanion.
2. The Br leaves, taking two electrons (E2 mechanism), leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, the structure would then have a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But in a benzene ring, that's a bit awkward. Let me count the positions. Positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So, forming a triple bond between them would make a ring with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the diradical formed could reorganize into a different structure, but I'm not sure.

If the triple bond forms, then the structure is now a triple bond between C1 and C6. But I'm not certain about the possible products from that.

Wait, the question is asking how many possible organic products are formed. So, maybe the reaction leads to more than one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms multiple isomers because the triple bond can form in different positions or because of different sites of deprotonation.

Wait, but in this molecule, the only possible site for deprotonation adjacent to Br is position 6. So, the triple bond would form between 1 and 6, making a structure like 1,6-didehydrobenzene or something. But that structure is a diradical or a triple bond.

But wait, perhaps the triple bond can then lead to some rearrangement. Maybe the triple bond could be in different positions, but given the substituents, perhaps only one is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the ring doesn't form a triple bond but instead undergoes some kind of ring contraction or expansion, leading to different products.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but as a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But without an incoming nucleophile, that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a proton from a position that's meta to the Br, leading to a different site of attack. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction forms a benzene ring with a new substituent. But without any other reagents, maybe the only product is the phenide ion, which doesn't count as a product in this context. Or perhaps the base induces some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the loss of HBr, forming a diradical that can then form different products. But I'm not certain about the possible products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a substituted benzene with a new substituent from the ammonia. But again, without an electrophile, I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the possible products in such a reaction. For example, when 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene is treated with a strong base, what could happen? If elimination occurs, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne), but I'm not sure if that's possible with only one Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates, but the Br doesn't leave, and nothing happens. But that's unlikely because the question expects a reaction.

Wait, maybe the Br is replaced by an amide group. If the NH2- attacks the benzene ring, replacing Br, that would be a nucleophilic substitution. But methyl groups are not strong enough activators for that. So, perhaps that doesn't happen.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2- acts as a base, abstracting a proton and leading to the elimination of Br, forming a new structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a methyl group moving. Like a ring expansion. But I'm not familiar with such a mechanism in this context.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the possible structures again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. The reagent is NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. So, the base would abstract a proton, perhaps from position 6.

So, if position 6 is deprotonated, then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6. But how would that look? The benzene ring would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, which are adjacent. So, the structure would be a triple bond between 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but that would result in a triple bond between 1 and 6, which is adjacent. So, the ring would have a triple bond, and the substituents at 2 and 4. But how would that affect the structure? Would that lead to any rearrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond could shift to a different position. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond would form between positions 1 and 2, but position 2 already has a methyl group, so that's not possible. So, the only possibility is between 1 and 6.

But wait, the ring can't have a triple bond and a substituent directly attached. Or can it? Maybe it's possible, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but instead forms a new ring structure, like a bicyclic compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge. Then, the Br leaves, and the ring becomes a phenide ion. But without another electrophile, where would the ring go? Maybe it just remains as the phenide ion, but that's not a product in this reaction context.

Alternatively, the phenide ion could attack another part of the molecule, but I don't see how that would work without another leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the base isn't just abstracting a proton but also causing some kind of coupling. But I don't recall such a reaction.

Another angle: The reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a new double bond. But again, benzene is already fully conjugated, so introducing a double bond isn't straightforward.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the loss of HBr and the formation of a new substituent. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the number of possible products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, either one product, or multiple.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and a triple bond between 1 and 6, that would form a single product. But wait, the triple bond could also form in a different position if another deprotonation is possible.

Wait, but in this structure, the only adjacent position to Br is position 6, as position 2 is a methyl. So, only one possible site for elimination, leading to one product. So the number of products would be 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract protons from other positions, leading to different products. For example, deprotonation at position 4, but that's already a methyl group. Or position 3. But position 3 is not adjacent to Br. So, maybe only position 6 is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to multiple products based on the position of the triple bond. But without another adjacent leaving group, I don't see how that's possible.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction forms a benzene ring with a new substituent after deprotonation and elimination. But without an incoming reagent, I don't think that's feasible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group. But methyl groups are not very acidic, and NaNH2 is a strong base, but I think the ring protons are more acidic than the methyl's, so the base would abstract a ring proton first.

So, putting it all together: The base abstracts a proton from position 6, adjacent to Br. This leads to the elimination of Br, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. So, the product is 1,6-didehydro-2,4-dimethylbenzene or something like that. 

But wait, that's just one product. So, the number of possible products is 1. So, option B) 1.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: The base could abstract a proton from position 3, which is ortho to the methyl groups but not adjacent to Br. Would that lead to a different product?

No, because the Br is at position 1, and the base would prefer to abstract a proton that's adjacent to Br because that's where elimination would be possible. Proton abstraction from position 3 wouldn't lead to any elimination since the Br is at 1, and position 3 is meta to Br.

So, the only possible product is the one formed by elimination from position 6. Therefore, only one product is formed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that typically facilitates deprotonation and elimination reactions. The structure of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene has a bromine atom at position 1, methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, and hydrogens at positions 3, 5, and 6.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Deprotonation and Elimination**:  
   NaNH₂ abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine atom. The only viable position for deprotonation is position 6, as position 2 is already occupied by a methyl group. This deprotonation creates a carbanion at position 6, which then leads to the elimination of HBr via an E2 mechanism. The elimination results in the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, yielding a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne-like structure).

2. **Substituent Effects**:  
   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are electron-donating and ortho/para-directing, but they do not significantly activate the ring for nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction proceeds via elimination rather than substitution because the methyl groups are insufficient to facilitate nucleophilic attack.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   The elimination of HBr from position 6 leads to a single product: a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, along with methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. No other positions for deprotonation or elimination are viable due to the steric and electronic constraints of the molecule.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces only one product, as the elimination occurs exclusively at position 6, resulting in a unique benzyne-like structure.
