Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants usually increase with the order of the complex, right? So β4 is 16, which is lower than β3, so maybe the complexes aren't necessarily in order of stability beyond the third? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed.

We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so that's the second complex, β2=40. Alternatively, wait, no—wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n, so the first would be Co(SCN), the second Co(SCN)_2, and so on. So the blue one is probably the one with two SCN- ions, so n=2, which is β2=40.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the colors. Oh well, the problem specifies the dithiocyanato as the blue complex. So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ ion. So I need to find the fraction of Co existing in that form.

The approach I remember is using the stability constants to find the distribution of the various complexes. The general formula is to express each complex's concentration in terms of [Co] and [SCN]^n, multiplied by the appropriate β and divided by the activity coefficients (but assuming they're 1 here, as is common in such problems).

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all possible complexes. So c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4].

But since the problem only asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], we can express that in terms of the other species.

Alternatively, the distribution depends on the formation of each complex step by step. The formation of each complex is governed by the respective stability constant. 

Stability constant (β) for the complex Co(SCN)_n is given by:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n 

But wait, each step requires adding another SCN^- to the previous complex. Hmm, but no, wait, the overall β for each complex is the cumulative product. So:

β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

And so on. So each subsequent β is a separate step.

But to calculate the distribution, you also have to consider the sequential formation. So for each n, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is determined by β_n multiplied by [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n, but each step builds upon the previous, considering all possible ways to form the complex.

Wait, but maybe an alternative approach is to consider the fraction of each complex. The fraction f_n of each complex is given by the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0 to 4} β_m [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, for each n, the term would be β_n [SCN^-]^n. So the denominator is the sum of all β_m [SCN^-]^m from m=0 to 4. But wait, m starts at 0, which is [Co^2+] (since β_0 is 1, but that's not given here. Wait, wait, the problem gives β1, β2, β3, β4. So what about β0? Oh, β0 would be 1 since it's [Co^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^0) =1. So the denominator includes β0=1, which is [Co^2+] as the term.

So the fractions would be:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 β_m [SCN^-]^m )

So for each n, f_n is the fraction of Co in that complex.

In this problem, the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the β values given are up to n=4, but the given β4 is 16. Hmm, that's a bit odd because β3 is 63, which is higher than β4. So does that mean that the Co(SCN)_4 complex is less stable than Co(SCN)_3? Well, that's possible. So the highest stability might be for n=3.

But regardless, let's proceed.

So, n can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

So first, compute each term β_m [SCN^-]^m for m=0 to 4.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So:

m=0: β0=1; term=1*(0.1)^0 =1*1=1

m=1: β1=9; term=9*(0.1)^1 =9*0.1=0.9

m=2: β2=40; term=40*(0.1)^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

m=3: β3=63; term=63*(0.1)^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

m=4: β4=16; term=16*(0.1)^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Now sum all these terms: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the fractions f_n for each n are (βn * [SCN]^n) / denominator.

We are interested in f_2, which is the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2].

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that:

0.4 divided by 2.3646. Hmm, 2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

2.3646 ≈ 2.365.

0.4 / 2.365 = approximately 0.16908, so about 16.908%.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the options given are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So 16.9% is option D.

But wait, the problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Dithiocyanato is two SCN groups, so n=2, which is β2=40. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. Do I have the fractions correctly? Because the denominator is sum of all terms, including n=0 (free Co^2+), n=1, n=2, etc. So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4/2.3646= ~0.169 or 16.9%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering β4=16. Wait, β4 is 16. So when m=4, term is 16*(0.1)^4=16e-4=0.0016, which is correct.

So the sum is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = sum them step by step.

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3+0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes.

So the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%, so option D.

But wait, wait. Another way to think about this is that when the ligand concentration is high, the higher complexes are favored. Wait, the given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 0.1, which is not extremely high, but not low either.

Wait, but the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations. The stability constant for a complex is defined as:

\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]

The fraction of cobalt in the form of each complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

Here, the total cobalt concentration includes contributions from all possible complexes: free cobalt ([Co\(^{2+}\)]), monothiocyanato ([Co(SCN)]), dithiocyanato ([Co(SCN)\_2]), trithiocyanato ([Co(SCN)\_3]), and tetrathiocyanato ([Co(SCN)\_4]).

### Step 1: Calculate the terms for each complex
Given:
- \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\)
- Stability constants: \(\beta_0 = 1\), \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), \(\beta_4 = 16\)

For each \(n\), compute \(\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n\):
- \(n = 0\): \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot (0.1)^0 = 1\)
- \(n = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot (0.1)^1 = 0.9\)
- \(n = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4\)
- \(n = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063\)
- \(n = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\)

### Step 2: Compute the denominator (total sum)
\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)\_2]
The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 4: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
