Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think through this.

First, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds normally because you're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities relativistically is different. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, that's the formula for adding two velocities in the same direction. Let me get this straight. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second?

Wait, no. Wait, actually, relative speed would be the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the second astronaut in the first's frame. Or wait, is it the other way around?

Wait, I think I should be careful. Let me define it properly. The first astronaut is moving at velocity u = 0.6c relative to an observer. The second is moving at v = 0.5c relative to the same observer. So from the first astronaut's frame, what is the speed of the second astronaut?

The formula for relative velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Because in this case, the second is moving at v in the same direction as the first, but at a lower speed. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction opposite to the first astronaut's motion, but since speed is a positive quantity, the relative speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that would match options C and D, which have v_rel as 0.14c.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the formula. I think the correct formula when you're finding the velocity of an object moving at v in the lab frame from the perspective of someone moving at u in the lab frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, since the second astronaut is moving slower in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that narrows it down to options C and D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 *3m c² = 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says 5mc². So the total energy is about 5.96 mc², which points to option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, another thought. When adding velocities, I considered the relative speed as 0.14c. But the problem says "the relative speed." So in this case, that's correct.

So putting it together, relative speed is 0.14c and total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, that's option C.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (the speed of the first astronaut) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (the speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but since speed is a scalar quantity, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\). This matches the relative speed in options C and D.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

This matches the total energy in option C. Combining the relative speed (\(0.14c\)) and the total energy (\(5.96m c^2\)), the correct answer is:
