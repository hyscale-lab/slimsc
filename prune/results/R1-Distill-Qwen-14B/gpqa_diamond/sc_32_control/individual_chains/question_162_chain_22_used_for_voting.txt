Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. So, this is a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx² and dy².

I think this resembles the metric for a sphere, but wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks similar to the equation of a sphere. Because the equation of a sphere with radius 2 would be x² + y² + z² = 4, but here maybe it's in two dimensions? Or maybe it's an embedded surface in higher dimensions.

Wait, the metric is written in terms of dx and dy, so perhaps it's a two-dimensional surface. But the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which suggests that this is a 2D surface embedded in maybe 3D, but I'm not entirely sure.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm a bit confused because the metric given doesn't look like the standard pseudosphere metric. Wait, the standard pseudosphere (or tractricoid) has a metric with a specific form, usually involving terms like (dr² + dz²) or something else with a negative curvature. But this metric is in terms of x and y, which might complicate things.

Wait, maybe this is a metric for a sphere in some coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric on a hyperbolic plane, which would have negative curvature and thus be a pseudosphere. But the form doesn't immediately look familiar.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a sphere with a specific radius. Let me think about the general form of the metric for a sphere. In spherical coordinates, the metric is (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's for a sphere in 3D. Hmm, but this is a 2D metric, so maybe it's a sphere in 2D, which is just a circle. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 minus the sum of squares. That suggests that the surface is defined where x² + y² <4, so it's inside a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So maybe this is a sphere of radius 2, but expressed in a different coordinate system.

Wait, but this is a 2D metric, so it's a 2D surface. But what's the area? For a sphere, the area is 4πr². But wait, radius here is 2, so 4π*(2)^2=16π. But that's for a standard sphere. But this might not be a standard sphere.

Alternatively, if this is a hyperbolic metric, the area could be infinite or something else. Wait, hyperbolic spaces have infinite area, right? But I'm not sure. Let's think about the metric more carefully.

The metric is conformally flat because it's written as a function times (dx² + dy²). The function is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Conformally flat metrics can represent spaces with different curvatures. For example, the sphere can be represented with a conformal metric in the Northern hemisphere. But wait, the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the surface is bounded because as x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric terms blow up. That makes me think that this is a compact space, perhaps a sphere.

Wait, but the area of a sphere in 2D is just a circle, which has area πr². But that's for a flat circle. But if this is a sphere in 2D (which is a circle embedded in 3D?), no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait. Let me consider the general form of a metric on a sphere. For a unit sphere in 2D, the metric in polar coordinates would be ds² = dr² + (sinθ)^2 dφ². But that's in 2D only if we're talking about a circle. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between 2D and 3D.

Wait, the question asks for a pseudosphere. Oh, pseudosphere is a term sometimes used for a tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in another context, a pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry. Wait, but hyperbolic plane is non-compact and has infinite area. So if we're talking about a hyperbolic pseudosphere, it's an infinite area.

Wait, but the metric given here might not be that. Let me calculate the Gaussian curvature to see what kind of geometry we're dealing with.

The Gaussian curvature for a metric in 2D that's conformally flat, like this one, can be calculated using the formula:

K = - (1/(2f)) * Δ(f),

where f is the conformal factor, and Δ is the Laplacian in flat space. Wait, the general formula is that for a metric g = f²(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is (−(1/(2f))Δf).

Alternatively, I think the formula is K = - (1/(2f)) * ( (f_{xx} + f_{yy}) ), because the Laplacian in 2D is f_xx + f_yy.

So let's compute f. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4−x²−y²) (dx² + dy²) = f² (dx² + dy²), where f² = 32/(4−x²−y²). So f = sqrt(32/(4−x²−y²)).

So f = (32)^½ / sqrt(4 - x² - y²) ) = 4*sqrt(2)/sqrt(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². Wait, but for the Laplacian, I need to compute f_xx + f_yy.

Wait, maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates, since x² + y² = r².

Let me define r² = x² + y², so r is the radial coordinate.

So f(r) = 4√2 / sqrt(4 − r²) = 4√2 (4 − r²)^(-1/2).

Compute the Laplacian in 2D for f(r):

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian of a radially symmetric function f(r) is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr).

So first, compute df/dr.

df/dr = d/dr [4√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2) ] 
= 4√2 * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r)
= 4√2 * (1/2) * 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2)
= 4√2 * r (4 - r²)^(-3/2)

Wait, let me re-calculate that more carefully.

df/dr = 4√2 * d/dr [ (4 - r²)^(-1/2) ) 
= 4√2 * (-1/2) * (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r)
Because the derivative of (4 - r²) is -2r.

So:

= 4√2 * (1/2) * 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) 

Wait, let me compute each step.

df/dr = 4√2 * (-1/2) * (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r)
The two negatives cancel, and 1/2 multiplied by 2r gives r.

So df/dr = 4√2 * r (4 - r²)^(-3/2)

Now, compute (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr )

r df/dr = r * 4√2 r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ) 
= 4√2 r² (4 - r²)^(-3/2)

Now take derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [4√2 r² (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ]

Let me compute this. Let me factor out the constants.

= 4√2 * d/dr [ r² (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ]

Use the product rule:

=4√2 [ 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + r² * (-3/2) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (-2r) ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term: 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2)

Second term: r² * (3/2)(2r) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) 
= r² * 3 r (4 - r²)^(-5/2)
= 3 r³ (4 - r²)^(-5/2)

So putting it all together:

=4√2 [ 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + 3 r³ (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) ]

Factor out r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) from both terms.

Note that (4 - r²)^(-3/2) = (4 - r²)^( -5/2 + 1 ) = (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (4 - r²).

So:

=4√2 [ r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [ 2(4 - r²) + 3 r² ] ) ]

Compute inside the brackets:

2(4 - r²) + 3 r² = 8 - 2 r² + 3 r² = 8 + r².

So the Laplacian becomes:

(1/r) [ d/dr (r df/dr) ] = 4√2 * [ r (8 + r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) ] * (1/r) )

The r in numerator and denominator cancels:

=4√2 (8 + r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2 )

Wait, but I think I might have messed up a step here. Let me go back:

Wait, the Laplacian is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr ), which after substitution, gives 4√2 [ (8 + r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) ]

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether I correctly applied the product rule. Let me recheck.

In the product rule step:

d/dr [ r² (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ] = 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + r² * (-3/2)(-2r) (4 - r²)^(-5/2)

Wait, the derivative of (4 - r²)^(-3/2) is (-3/2)(4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (-2r) = 3 r (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

So the second term is r² * 3 r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) = 3 r^3 (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

So when we add the two terms: 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + 3 r^3 (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

But to factor out (4 - r²)^(-5/2), I can write (4 - r²)^(-3/2) as (4 - r²) * (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

So the first term becomes 2r (4 - r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) = 2r (4 - r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

Wait, no: (4 - r²)^(-3/2) = (4 - r²)^(-5/2 + 1) )= (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (4 - r²)^1.

So, putting it together, the first term is 2r (4 - r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) and the second term is 3r^3 (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

So when we factor out (4 - r²)^(-5/2), we have:

[2r (4 - r²) + 3 r^3 ] * (4 - r²)^(-5/2)

Simplify the bracket: 2r (4 - r²) + 3 r^3 = 8 r - 2 r^3 + 3 r^3 = 8r + r^3.

So the Laplacian is 4√2 [ (8 r + r^3) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) ] 

Wait, but that's the derivative of r df/dr. Then the Laplacian is (1/r) times that, so:

(1/r) * 4√2 (8 r + r^3) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) 

=4√2 (8 + r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) 

So K = - (1/(2f)) * Laplacian(f)

Wait, the formula for Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2f)) (Δ f ), where Δ is the Laplacian. Because the metric is f² (dx² + dy²), so K = -(Δ f )/(2f).

So plugging in f:

f = 4√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2)

Δ f = [4√2 (8 + r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ] 

So,

K = - [ (4√2 (8 + r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) ] / [ 2 * 4√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

2 *4√2 =8√2

Denominator exponent: (4 - r^2)^(-1/2)

So,

K= - [4√2 (8 + r²) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ] / [8√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4√2 /8√2 = (4/8) (√2/√2) )= (1/2) (1) )= 1/2.

The (4 - r²) terms: (4 - r²)^(-5/2) / (4 - r²)^(-1/2) ) = (4 - r²)^(-5/2 + 1/2) )= (4 - r²)^(-2) )= 1/(4 - r²)^2.

Putting it all together:

K = - [ (1/2) * (8 + r²) ] / (4 - r²)^2 

Simplify numerator:

(8 + r²) = 8 + r².

So,

K = - [ (8 + r²) ] / [ 2 (4 - r²)^2 ] 

Wait, but this seems complicated. Let me plug in r² = x² + y². Alternatively, maybe I should evaluate this at a particular point, but perhaps the curvature is constant. Wait, if the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, then K would be a negative constant. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, because the Gaussian curvature of a pseudosphere is a negative constant. Let me check if this expression for K is a constant.

Wait, the expression for K has r² in it, which suggests that the curvature varies with r. But a pseudosphere should have constant curvature, so perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken in thinking that this metric represents a pseudosphere. Maybe it's a sphere instead. Alternatively, perhaps the area isn't finite, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, the radius in the metric is 2 because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 2 squared. So perhaps this is a sphere of radius 2, and the area would be 4πr² = 16π. But wait, the options don't have 16π. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² − y² )

D) +infty

Hmm, none of the options is 16π. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the area is zero because the metric is singular at x² + y² =4, making the space compact, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the metric is for a flat space, but that doesn't make sense because the function would be 1, not 32/(4 - ...).

Wait, another approach: compute the area by integrating the area element over the entire space.

The area element in the metric is (32/(4 -x² - y²)) dx dy. So the area A is the double integral over the region where 4 -x² - y² >0, which is the disk x² + y² <4.

So,

A= ∫∫ [32/(4 -x² -y²)] dx dy

We can switch to polar coordinates:

x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy = r dr dθ.

Thus,

A= ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

Compute the integral:

First, the θ integration is straightforward:

A = 2π ∫(r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr

Let me compute the radial integral.

Let me make substitution: let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So,

Integral becomes:

∫(u=4 to 0) [32/(u)] * (-1/2) du 
= ∫(u=4 to 0) [32 * (-1/2) /u ] du 
= ∫(u=4 to 0) (-16)/u du 

The negative sign flips the limits:

= ∫(u=0 to4) 16/u du 

But wait, 16/u integrated from 0 to4 would be divergent because as u approaches 0 from the positive side, 16/u approaches infinity.

Wait, that's a problem. So the integral becomes:

= 16 ∫(0 to4) (1/u) du = 16 [ ln(u) ) from 0 to4 ]

But ln(0) is -infinity, so this integral diverges to positive infinity.

Wait, so the area is infinite? That would suggest the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, the original metric is only defined for x² + y² <4, which is a finite region (a disk of radius 2). But the area element is 32/(4 - r²) r dr dθ, which goes to infinity as r approaches 2. So the integral diverges, making the area infinite.

But that seems counterintuitive because the disk is of finite radius. However, the metric's scaling factor is singular at the boundary, making the area element blow up there. So the area is indeed infinite.

But wait, is this a pseudosphere? A pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite area surface, but perhaps in this case, the metric is of a different kind. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect or the options don't match the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the area is infinite, which would make the answer D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the integral. Let me recheck the substitution.

The integral is ∫(0 to2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute without substitution.

Let me write 32 r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me note that d/dr (4 - r²) = -2r → (4 - r²)’ = -2r.

So, 32 r/(4 - r²) dr = -16 * [ (-2r)/(4 - r²) ] dr = -16 d(4 - r²).

So, the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ d(4 - r²) evaluated from r=0 to r=2.

Which is -16 [ (4 - (2)^2) - (4 - 0^2) ) ] = -16 [ (4-4) -4 ) ] = -16 [ (0 -4) ) ] = -16 (-4) )= 64.

Wait, that's different. Wait, let me do that again.

Wait, ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to2.

Let u =4 - r² → du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du= r dr.

So, 32 r/(4 - r²) dr = 32 [ (r dr) / (4 - r²) ) ] = 32 [ ( (-1/2) du ) / u ) ] 
= -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

So the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ du from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2).

So,

-16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So,

-16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] → -16*(-infty) → positive infinity.

So the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite.

That's odd because the region of integration is finite, but the integrand becomes singular at r=2. So the area is infinite.

Thus, the answer would be D) +infty.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions, where the conformal factor is \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The metric is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The task is to compute the area of this space.

### Step 1: Area Element
The area element in the metric is given by:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 2: Total Area
The total area \( A \) is obtained by integrating the area element over the entire domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), or equivalently \( 0 \leq r \leq 2 \) and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi \):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral is straightforward:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluating the Radial Integral
To evaluate the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr,
\]

we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Changing the limits accordingly:

- When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \).
- When \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \).

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0^+ \). This indicates that the area is infinite.

### Step 4: Interpretation
The metric is singular at \( r = 2 \) (where \( 4 - r^2 = 0 \)), causing the area element to blow up at the boundary of the disk. Despite the finite domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), the singularity in the metric leads to an infinite total area.

### Conclusion
The area of the space described by the given metric is infinite.
