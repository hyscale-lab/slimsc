Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and bases are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with a base.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are given for each. I'm a bit confused because there are three solutions here. Wait, so I think the reaction is a combination of all three mixing together. But wait, how do they react with each other?

Let me think about the possible reactions. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, the acids will react with the base. But wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will provide OH- ions.

Let me calculate the moles of each to see what's going on.

HCl: volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, so 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: volume is 300 mL (0.3 L) and 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL (0.2 L) and 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So per mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the reaction between acids and bases would be H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. But I need to consider how much H+ and OH- are available.

Wait, but there are two acids here. So the total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, when they react, the OH- will neutralize the H+. But which one is in excess?

Let's see: H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2. So OH- will be the limiting reagent. All OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water. That's the neutralization part.

But wait, what about the remaining H+? After reacting 0.2 moles H+ with OH-, 0.08 moles of H+ will be left (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08). These excess H+ ions are still in solution but don't react further because there's no more OH-.

But wait, the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. Oh, right, the enthalpy change comes from the reaction of H+ and OH- to form water. So the amount of heat released would be based on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually reacted.

Wait, but wait a second. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of acid reacting with base. And for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy is around -57 kJ/mol (but wait, that's per mole of H+ reacting).

Alternatively, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 57 kJ of energy as heat.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy when these three solutions are mixed. So all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. But let me double-check.

Wait, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react. The remaining 0.08 H+ will stay in solution, but they don't contribute to the neutralization enthalpy because they're not reacting with OH-.

So the moles of H+ neutralized are 0.2. Each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ (I think the value is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+). But wait, I should confirm the exact value. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-).

Wait, another point: for H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid, the first H+ is strong, but the second is weaker. But in aqueous solution, especially in dilute conditions, H2SO4 completely dissociates the first H+ and the second as well (I think in dilute solutions, the second H+ may dissociate to a significant extent). But in the case of strong bases like Ba(OH)2, the reaction would probably involve both H+ from H2SO4 reacting.

Wait, but in this calculation, I considered all H+ from H2SO4. So I think that's correct.

So, moles of H+ reacting: 0.2. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So that's approximately -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, because the options are in kcal and kJ. Wait the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, wait. My calculation is in kJ, but the options have both kcal and kJ.

Hmm, this is important. Because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So I need to check the units.

Wait, wait. The calculation I did was 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. So that's about -11,400 J or so. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 57 kJ is about 13.64 kcal (since 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.64). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × 13.64 ≈ 2.728 kcal. But that would be if I converted the 57 kJ to kcal.

Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). Alternatively, sometimes it's given as -57 kJ per mole of acid, but for strong monoprotic acids, it's -57 kJ per mole. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so when considering neutralization, each mole contributes two moles of H+.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the exact process. Neutralization enthalpy is the heat when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. For a diprotic acid, each mole would react with two moles of base, so the enthalpy change would be double.

Wait, but in the case of mixing these solutions, we have to find out how much acid and base are reacting. So perhaps I should look for the limiting reagent.

But wait, in this problem, the acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2.

HCl is monoprotic, so each mole provides one H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole provides two H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, providing two OH- per formula unit.

So the reaction would be: H+ (from acids) + OH- (from base) → H2O.

So the total H+ available is:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+ (since 2 per mole).

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2 mol. H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the OH- will react with 0.2 mol of H+.

Each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57 kJ. So 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. But since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's bigger than 11.4, so not this. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.4 × 1000 J × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) → Wait, no, option B is in kcal, but I have kJ.

Wait, 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal). So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 × 13.6 = 2.72 kcal. But that's not matching any option. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. For monoprotic strong acids, it's about -57 kJ per mole of acid, which is the same as -57 kJ per mole of H+. For diprotic acids, each mole contributes two H+, so the enthalpy would be about -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. The enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. For a diprotic acid, one mole would require two moles of base. So, for H2SO4, the reaction would be H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is approximately -114 kJ (since 2 × 57 kJ).

Hmm, so in this problem, we have a mixture of HCl and H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: find out how much of each acid reacts with the Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per mole. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize 2 moles of H+.

The total H+ available is 0.28 moles.

The Ba(OH)2 available is 0.1 moles, which can provide 0.2 moles of OH-. So it can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So all the Ba(OH)2 will be consumed, as it's the limiting reagent.

So the reaction is: H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

The total H+ consumed is 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (standard enthalpy per mole of H+).

But wait, what's the standard value? I think for strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), so 57 kJ released per mole.

So for 0.2 moles, that's 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, so 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.727 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). Because 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72.

Hmm, but that would make the answer around -2.72 kcal, which is option A. But wait, that's not matching my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up kcal and kJ. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial problem gave the options in both kcal and kJ. So perhaps I need to calculate whether the correct answer is given in kcal or kJ.

Wait, 57 kJ is about 13.64 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.727 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be approximately -2.727 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, that seems conflicting because earlier I thought the change was -11.4 kJ. But the options have both units, so I need to see which is correct.

Wait, what's the standard enthalpy of neutralization? It's usually around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of acid for monoprotic). So if the calculation is in kJ, then it's -11.4 kJ, which would correspond to option D if it were -11.4, but option D is -16.0, which is a different number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles. Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → each contributes 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So, the OH- is the limiting reagent.

So, 0.2 moles H+ reacting with 0.2 moles OH-.

Each mole of H+ reaction gives about -57 kJ (exothermic).

So, total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is different because it's diprotic. Wait, the neutralization of the first H+ is about -57 kJ, but the second H+ has a different value. For H2SO4, the second H+ has a lower enthalpy of neutralization because it's a weaker acid.

Wait, but in the case of a strong base like Ba(OH)2, both H+ ions might be neutralized. So perhaps the enthalpy for the first H+ is about -57 kJ, and the second is about -50 kJ (I'm not sure about the exact value). But without exact data, perhaps the problem assumes each H+ contributes -57 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to consider all moles of H+ and OH-, regardless of the acid type.

Wait, perhaps another approach: considering the total H+ and OH- moles.

Total H+ available: 0.28 moles.

Total OH-: 0.2 moles.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Each mole of H+ reacts to release 57 kJ, so 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have 11.4 kJ in the D option is -16.0, which is not matching. Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: perhaps the correct approach is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess, then compute the heat based on that.

Wait, let me reassess. The H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So only 0.2 H+ reacts with OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water. The remaining 0.08 H+ is unreacted. So the heat is from 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × 57 kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Looking again at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ. So why is option D -16.0 kJ? That would be if 0.28 moles of H+ reacted, but that's not possible because OH- is limiting.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering that Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per mole, but perhaps the neutralization reaction for each OH- contributes to the enthalpy.

Wait, no. Each OH- reacts with one H+ to form water, so each mole of OH- contributes 57 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different standard value, like 55.8 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, 55.8 × 0.2 = 11.16, which is approximately 11.2 kJ. Still not matching option D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recalculate.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles.

So H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

Reaction: 0.2 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O. Enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Hmm.

Looking at the options again, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than 11.4. So that can't be right.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ are available, and the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But the molar ratio here is 1:1.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is limiting, perhaps.

Wait, but that approach might be wrong because HCl is also present and can react. I think the correct approach is to treat all H+ (from all acids) and OH- as reacting until one is exhausted.

So, the initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -3.80 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, 3.80 kcal is about 16 kJ (since 3.8 *4.184≈ 15.9 kJ). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × 3.8 = 0.76 kcal, which isn't matching any option. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total energy in terms of kcal.

Wait, 0.2 moles × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ.

Now, 11.4 kJ converted to kcal: 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.725 kcal.

Which is approximately 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier I thought the correct calculation gives -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, and the correct value is approximately -2.72 kcal.

So between option A and option B.

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.42 × 4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ. But our calculation was 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So if the problem expects the answer in kcal, option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results based on the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to consider the moles of H+ and H2SO4 and HCl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization of each mole of acid produces a certain amount of heat.

For HCl: it's monoprotic, so each mole releases 57 kJ.

For H2SO4: each mole releases 114 kJ (since it's diprotic, so each mole reacts with two moles of base).

Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- per mole.

So, the reaction would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O → enthalpy: -57 kJ per mole of HCl.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O → enthalpy: -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

So, the total heat would be the sum of the heat from each acid reacting with Ba(OH)2.

But wait, how much of each acid reacts?

HCl: 0.1 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 can react with one mole of HCl (since HCl provides one H+ and Ba(OH)2 provides two OH-).

Wait, no. The reaction would be HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But the stoichiometry is 1:1 for HCl and Ba(OH)2, producing 1 mole of H2O (but uses 2 H+ from HCl ? No, wait HCl is monoprotic, so each mole gives one H+.

Wait, the reaction of HCl with Ba(OH)2 would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So, 2 moles of HCl react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

Similarly, for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

This reaction is 1:1.

So, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles.

HCl is 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is 0.09 moles.

So, for HCl: since it takes 2 moles of HCl to react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, the available HCl is 0.1 moles, which can only react with 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2.

But Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles. So, after reacting 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2 with HCl, there's 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2 left.

Now, the H2SO4 can react with the remaining 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 requires 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 per mole of H2SO4.

So, 0.05 moles Ba(OH)2 can react with 0.05 moles H2SO4.

But H2SO4 is 0.09 moles available. So, 0.05 moles will react, leaving 0.04 moles of H2SO4 unreacted.

So, the reactions are:

1. 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → products. HCl used: 0.1 moles → 0.05 moles Ba(OH)2 used.

2. 1 H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → products. H2SO4 used: 0.05 moles, Ba(OH)2 used: 0.05.

3. Remaining: 0.04 moles H2SO4, and 0 moles Ba(OH)2 left.

Now, the H+ from unreacted H2SO4: 0.04 moles × 2 = 0.08 moles H+.

Additionally, any H+ from HCl? No, because HCl was all consumed in reaction 1.

So the total H+ neutralized comes from:

From reaction 1: 2 HCl → 2 H+ → 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles H+.

Wait, no. Wait, each HCl gives one H+, so 0.1 moles HCl gives 0.1 moles H+.

Reaction 1: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So 2 HCl → 2 H+ → 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Reaction 2: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ → 0.05 moles H2SO4 gives 0.1 moles H+.

So total H+ neutralized is 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 moles.

So, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.4 × 1000 J = -11,400 J.

Wait, but the options include D as -16.0 kJ, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the reaction's enthalpy includes both H+ from HCl and H2SO4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the correct calculation is -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- available, find the limiting reagent, and then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

In this case, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, only option B is close in kJ terms if we convert it.

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Converting that to kJ: 11.42 × 4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ. That's higher than our calculation, so that can't be right.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our -11.4 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing some aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the reaction of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2 produces more H+ neutralization.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- again, but maybe I made a mistake.

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M=0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So:

H+ =0.28, OH-=0.2.

So, 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 mol of H2O.

So, 0.2 ×57 = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match this except perhaps option B, but option B is in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.727 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.727). So the enthalpy change is -2.727 kcal, which is approximately option A (-2.72 kcal).

But wait, I'm confused because another approach suggested 0.2 moles ×57 kJ is -11.4 kJ.

So why is there a discrepancy? Because the options have both units. The correct approach is to use the units given in the options.

Wait, the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization." Enthalpy of neutralization is typically reported in kJ per mole of H+ or per mole of acid, but the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps the correct answer is in kJ, but I don't see an option that matches.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in kcal. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another consideration: perhaps the problem uses the value 55.8 kJ per mole of H+.

So 0.2 ×55.8=11.16 kJ, which is about 2.67 kcal. So the closest would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total H+ contributed by both acids and the OH- from the base, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the dilution effect. But no, the problem asks for the enthalpy, which is a molar quantity, not dependent on concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to consider the moles of the limiting reagent. Since Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles, and each mole provides 2 OH-, the total OH- is 0.2. So the H+ neutralized is 0.2, releasing 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

So, if the problem's options are in kJ, but none match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option D (-16.0 kJ), but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's think about the reactions again.

When mixing all three solutions, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

So, the correct answer should be -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option. The options are D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. For example, if the enthalpy of neutralization is taken as -16.7 kJ per mole of H+ (I think I've heard of this value before, but I'm not certain).

0.2 ×16.7=3.34 kJ, which is about 0.797 kcal, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess. But I've already done that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the answer to be based on the total H+ available, 0.28 moles, and the total OH- is 0.2, so the neutralization is 0.2, but the problem might have considered the excess H+ as contributing to the solution, but not to the enthalpy change.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct enthalpy change is approximately -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So the closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{moles of H₂SO₄} \). Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - Total H⁺ from acids: \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂} \). Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻: \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - H⁺ available: \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).
   - OH⁻ available: \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it will neutralize \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ per mole of H⁺} \).
   - Moles of H⁺ neutralized: \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).
   - Total enthalpy change: \( 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal if necessary:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \).
   - \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value in kcal.
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is inconsistent with the calculation.
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect.
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is inconsistent with the calculation.

The correct answer is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
