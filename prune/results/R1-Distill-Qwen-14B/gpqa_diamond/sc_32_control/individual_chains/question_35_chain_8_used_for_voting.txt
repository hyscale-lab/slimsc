Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, angular momentum... I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The problem gives me some details about the operator Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. 

Wait, c is given as h divided by 4π. Right, I think I remember that h is Planck's constant, but wait, sometimes people use ħ, which is h/(2π), so c here is h/(4π), which is ħ/2. Oh, because ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) would be ħ/2. So c = ħ/2. That makes sense because the spin matrices are often scaled by ħ/2.

The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that down:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Wait, I think that's the structure of the Pauli Y matrix. Oh wait, no, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me think: σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so S is indeed the Pauli Y matrix. Oh, right, so S is σ_y.

So Ay is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y, because c is h/(4π) which is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the options don't directly ask for the eigenvalues but rather statements about them and other properties.

Wait, but let me go through the process. To find eigenvalues, I know I need to solve the equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, for a matrix operator, the eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But let me think about the structure of Ay. Ay is proportional to σ_y, which is a Pauli matrix. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of σ_y are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) multiplied by those, so a = (ħ/2)(±1) = ± ħ/2. Alternatively, since ħ is h/(2π), that's ± (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = ± h/(4π). Wait, because c is h/(4π), so Ay is c * S, and S is σ_y. So if σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay's eigenvalues would be c*(±1) = ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So that would make the eigenvalues of Ay ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But that doesn't match, because here the eigenvalues are real, right? Because the operator is Hermitian. Wait, wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix. Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, so Ay should be Hermitian too (since c is real). So the eigenvalues should be real, which would make the imaginary parts zero. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Imaginary parts are ±2πh or similar. That can't be right because eigenvalues are real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B) Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But that would imply eigenvalues are complex, which can't be the case for a Hermitian operator. So B is wrong.

Option C) The eigenfunction can also be eigenfunction of A². Hmm, because A² is the square of the angular momentum. Since A² is a Casimir operator, its eigenvalues are the same for all directions, so any eigenstate of Ay should also be an eigenstate of A². Because A² commutes with all components, including Ay. So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A squared.

Additionally, what about the Z-component, Az? Az and Ay don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So while phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not an eigenfunction of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Which is correct. So that's a possible correct statement.

Option D) The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about this. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, so they form a basis. So if the operator is 2x2, it has two eigenfunctions which form a basis for the space. So D is correct in that statement. But wait, the operator's matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct. But let's see the other options.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but given the way the choices are made, only one is correct.

Wait, let's go back to the eigenvalues. Since Ay is Hermitian, its eigenvalues are real. So any option suggesting otherwise is wrong. So A and B are out.

So between C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunction can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. As A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also eigenfunction of A². So that part is correct. But it says 'not of the Z-component, Az.' Which is correct because [Ay, Az] = iħ A... something, so they don't commute. So eigenstates of Ay aren't eigenstates of Az. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the basis functions (the eigenvectors) are the ones that diagonalize Ay. So yes, they form a basis for the space, so they are the basis functions for Ay. So D is correct as well? Or is it a statement that's always true?

Wait, any Hermitian operator's eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space, so in this case, since the matrix is 2x2, the two eigenvectors are orthogonal and can form the basis. So D is correct as a statement.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So if I'm calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statements hold.

Wait, let me reexamine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmmm, the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the vector space. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors are a basis for the 2-dimensional space, so they are the basis functions of Ay. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So both C and D might be correct. But looking at the options, I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement is considered correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, let's see.

Wait, how about the eigenvalues. Since S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay has eigenvalues c*(±1) = ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So eigenvalues are real and equal to ±h/(4π). So looking at the options, none of them directly say that. Only option C and D are relating to the properties of the eigenfunctions.

So with that, the correct statements would be C and D, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, but the options don't allow for multiple correct, so I have to reevaluate.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so yes, that's correct. So D is correct.

But in the context of the problem, the question is which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but looking at the options, which one is presented as correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The matrix S is 2x2, so it's a spin-½ system. The eigenfunctions of Ay are spin-up and spin-down in the Y direction.

Now, for option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Since A² is the total angular momentum squared, which for spin-½ is (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So any state is an eigenstate of A² with the same eigenvalue, regardless of the direction. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenvectors form the basis of the operator. Since the eigenvectors are orthogonal and span the space, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So if both C and D are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in D. The basis functions of the matrix operator Ay refers to the matrix representation. Wait, the eigenvectors are the basis functions, but in the matrix representation, the basis is usually the standard basis. So the eigenvectors as a set form a different basis, but are they the basis for Ay? Or is it the standard basis that represents Ay as a matrix?

Hmm, the matrix representation of Ay is written with respect to some basis, say the standard basis. The eigenbasis is a different basis, but the eigenvectors are the basis functions for that operator in their own right. So I think D is correct.

But the problem is that in the options, C and D could both be correct. But the options are presented as independent, so I need to see which is correct.

Wait, let's think about the eigenfunctions. If Ay has eigenfunctions, then each eigenfunction is associated with a particular eigenvalue. The eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

So going back to the problem, which statement is correct during the calculation.

I think option D is correct because the eigenvectors are the basis of the matrix operator. So in that setup, the eigenvectors are the basis. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have option C as correct.

Wait, let me think about the possible options. The question is a multiple-choice, so the correct answer is one of the four.

So, based on the analysis, the eigenvalues are real and equal to ±h/(4π). So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So A and B are out.

Then, between C and D.

Option C: eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², not of Az.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

So both statements are correct. But looking at the given options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is correct. So I think C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, so any operator can be diagonal in that basis.

But the question is about during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is considered correct. So, for example, when you calculate the eigenvectors, you're finding the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That makes sense, because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator in that they can express any state in terms of them. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So all four options are statements about the process or results. So, I think the correct answer is C and D.

But looking at the options, the correct one must be either C or D.

Wait, another angle: which operator's eigenvectors do not form a basis? No, eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator always form an orthonormal basis for the space when the operator is diagonalizable, which it is because it's a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues (assuming S has two distinct eigenvalues, which it does: +1 and -1). So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The question says, which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because when you diagonalize the matrix, you find the basis functions, which are the eigenvectors.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Yes, correct. Because A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions can be shared. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so the eigenfunctions aren't shared.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, and thus for the operator. So D is correct.

But the question is which is correct. So both C and D are correct statements. But the options are presented as different options, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for more clues. Let's think about the matrix Ay.

Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So let's compute Ay squared.

Ay^2 = (h/(4π))^2 * [[0, -i],[i,0]]^2.

The square of S is [[-1, 0],[0,-1]] because S^2 = σ_y^2 = [[-1,0], [0,-1]].

So A^2 (the square of the operator) is (h^2/(16π²)) * (-1) * I, where I is the identity matrix. So the eigenvalues of A^2 are (h^2/(16π²))*(-1) and same again, because the identity matrix has eigenvalues 1. So A² has eigenvalues (-h²)/(16π²) for both eigenstates? No, wait, the operator A is the angular momentum, and for spin-1/2, A² should have eigenvalue (s(s+1))ħ², where s=1/2. So s(s+1)= (1/2)(3/2)=3/4. So A² eigenvalues are (3/4)ħ². But let me compute it via the matrix.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute the matrix Ay squared.

Ay = (c) S, where c = h/(4π), and S is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

So S^2 = [[0,-i],[i,0]] * [[0,-i],[i,0]].

Compute first element: (0*0) + (-i * i) = 0 + (-i*i)= (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Wait, wait.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S squared is:

Row 1: [ (0*0 + (-i)(i)), (0*(-i) + (-i)(0)) ]
= [ (0 + (-i^2) ), (0 + 0) ]
= [ (0 + (-(-1)) ), 0 ] => [1, 0]

Row 2: [ (i*0 + 0*i), (i*(-i) + 0*0) ]
= [0, ( -i^2 ) ]
= [0, -(-1) ] => [0, 1]

So S^2 = [[1, 0],[0,1]] = I.

Wait, that can't be right because S is the Pauli Y matrix. Let me double-check.

Compute S^2:

Element [1,1]: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = 0 - (-1) = 1.

Element [1,2]: (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0.

Element [2,1]: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

Element [2,2]: (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So S^2 is indeed the identity matrix I. So S squared is I. So then Ay squared is (c^2) S^2 = c^2 I.

So the eigenvalues of Ay squared are c^2 times the eigenvalues of I, which are 1, so the eigenvalues are c^2 * 1. So the eigenvalues are (h/(4π))².

But wait, that can't be right because the eigenvalues of A squared should be proportional to ħ² (3/4 ħ² for spin 1/2). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, no. Because Ay is the Y-component of the spin angular momentum, which has magnitude sqrt(s(s+1))ħ, but each component has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me step back.

So, when I compute the eigenvalues of Ay, I get ±h/(4π).

Now, the eigenfunctions of Ay are spin-up and spin-down in the Y direction. These are the same as the eigenfunctions of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So their eigenfunctions are shared. So option C is correct.

So, the correct answer must be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The Pauli Y matrix \( S \) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Option A:**  
   This option suggests that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

3. **Option B:**  
   This option suggests that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real and equal to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

4. **Option C:**  
   This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of the Z-component \( A_z \).  
   - \( A^2 \) is a Casimir operator and commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).  
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).  
   This statement is correct.

5. **Option D:**  
   This option states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).  
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) operates.  
   - Since \( A_y \) is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors span the space and can serve as the basis functions for the operator.  
   This statement is also correct.

### Conclusion:
Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks for the correct statement "during the calculation" of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Option C provides a more specific and relevant insight into the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), making it the most appropriate choice.

**Answer: C**
