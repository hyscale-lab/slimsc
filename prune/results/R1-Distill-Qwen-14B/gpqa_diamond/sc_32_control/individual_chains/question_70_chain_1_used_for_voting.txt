Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions, and ultimately, we're supposed to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are point groups from molecular symmetry. Point groups are used to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements.

So, let's break down the reactions given. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Third: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Fourth: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think the key here is to figure out what substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are. Once I know E, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

Let's start with reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). H is a solvent, so maybe something like water, ethanol, or maybe a more complex solvent. But given that D and B are gases reacting in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps they're combining to form something like H2O. Wait, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is something like NH3, which is a gas? Or perhaps something else, like HCl? Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, etc., and weak ones like CH3COOH, HNO2, etc. So maybe C is a metal oxide or a metal carbonate that when it reacts with water produces acids. But wait, if C is a metal oxide, reacting with water would form a metal hydroxide, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide or another compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces acids.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2, which isn't an acid, though. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like AlN, which reacts with water to form NH3 and Al(OH)3. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate or another salt. Not sure yet.

Let me think about reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. The stoichiometry is 1:8. That's a lot of equivalents. Which reaction forms a product with such a ratio? Maybe something like the formation of a chloroalkane from an alkali metal? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction like the formation of a transition metal compound. Wait, 8 B per A—could B be something like Cl2, and A be a metal that forms an octachloride? For example, maybe A is Fe, and B is Cl2. 8 equivalents would be 4 moles of Cl2? Wait, FeCl4 would be tetra, but FeCl3 is more common. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the bright red product C. Bright red solids in chemistry are often things like mercury(II) oxide (HgO) but that's red, but that's more of a dark red. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else. Wait, sodium nitrate forms a red precipitate in some reactions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound, but they can vary in color.

Alternatively, when copper reacts with concentrated nitric acid, it produces a blue solution, but maybe the product is a different color. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if product C is a sulfide. Sulfides can be bright colors. For example, CdS is bright yellow, but perhaps another sulfide is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate, but I'm not recalling a bright red nitrate.

Wait, another approach: reaction 2. C reacts with 2 D to form E, which is very hazardous. If E is a hazardous substance, perhaps it's something like chlorine gas, sarin gas, or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a highly toxic compound like cyanide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps E is a radioactive substance, but I think the question is more about common chemicals.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule. For example, O2, Cl2, etc., but those are not that hazardous in some cases. Alternatively, maybe E is a product of decomposition.

Let me think about the reactions again. Another angle: looking at reaction 3, C with water gives A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak. So maybe C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, if C is ammonium nitrate, but that's more of a white crystalline solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. For instance, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (which is an acid when dissolved, but not exactly an acid. Wait, but F and G are acids. So maybe C is a sulfite, which when hydrolyzed produces H2SO3 and maybe another acid? Not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, NH3 is a weak acid in water, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about D and B reacting to form H. D and B are gases, in 1:1 ratio. H is a solvent. Common solvents that can be formed from gases reacting in 1:1 ratio: perhaps H is HCl, but HCl is a gas. Or maybe H is NH3, which is a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4, but that's not typically a product of such reactions.

Wait, another possibility: If B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H could be HCl, but that would require H2 and Cl2 reacting. But that's a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, forming H2O, but H2O is a liquid. But the problem states that H is a solvent, which could be liquid. So H could be H2O.

Wait, if H is H2O, then D and B are H2 and O2. But O2 is a diatomic gas, H2 as well. So O2 plus H2 in 1:1 ratio would form H2O. But that requires a catalyst, such as in the Haber process? No, the Haber process uses N2 and H2 to make NH3. Wait, but in any case, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then H could be HCl, which is a gas, but HCl is a solvent? Well, it's a liquid when pure, but in the reaction, perhaps it's a gas. But if H is a solvent, then it's likely a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that wouldn't make sense because they are both gases. Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is H2O, but then H could be something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reactions in order.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. So A is a solid, B is gas. Product C is bright red.

Second reaction: C + 2 D → E (hazardous).

Third: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak.

Fourth: D + B → H (solvent).

Wait, let's think about reaction 4. D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is a solvent made from D and B.

If H is a common solvent, perhaps H is methanol, ethanol, water, etc.

Let's think about H as water. Then D and B would be H2O's components. But H2O is made from H2 and O2. But O2 is a diatomic gas, so if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. Then reaction 4 would be H2 + O2 → H2O. That makes sense.

So if B is O2 (gas), D is H2 (gas), then H is H2O (solvent).

Then, let's go back to reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. B is O2 here.

So A is a solid reacting with O2 to form C. 8 equivalents of O2 implies 4 moles of O2 per mole of A. So for every mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are used.

What solid reacts with O2 in such a way? Perhaps something like sodium (Na) reacting with O2 to form NaO2? Wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, but that's with one O2 per two Na. Wait, sodium reacts with O2 to form Na2O (1 O2 per 2 Na) or NaO2 (superoxide) with one O2 per Na.

Wait, but the stoichiometry here is 8 O2 per A. So if A is Na, then 8 O2 would be 16 O atoms. So the formula would be NaO8, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe. Iron reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Let me calculate the moles.

Suppose A is Fe, which has a valency of +2 or +3.

FeO: Fe^2+ and O^2- → formula FeO. Each Fe uses 1 O2 molecule (since O2 is diatomic). So for each Fe atom, 1 O2 is used. So to get 8 O2 per Fe, the formula would require 8 O per Fe. So possible formulae could be FeO8, but that's not a real compound. Alternatively, perhaps multiple Fe atoms per O2.

Wait, maybe the formula is something like Fe3O4. Fe3O4 can be written as FeO·Fe2O3. So for each Fe3O4, it requires 4 O2 molecules. So for 3 Fe atoms, 4 O2. So 4 O2 per 3 Fe. So the ratio is 4 O2 per 3 Fe. But in reaction 1, the ratio is 8 O2 per 1 Fe (assuming A is Fe). So 8 O2 per Fe would require a formula like FeO8, which doesn't exist as far as I know.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about other possibilities.

Another thought: Perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, lead(IV) oxide, PbO2. Lead is a metal that can have +2 and +4 oxidation states. PbO2 is a brown solid, not bright red, though. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal oxide with a bright red color.

Wait, mercury(I) oxide is red, but I'm not sure about the formula. Mercury(I) oxide would be HgO, but I think that's more of a dark red. Alternatively, cobalt compounds can be various colors, but I'm not sure if any are bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think about the color. Bright red could also be a result of certain coordination complexes, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another angle. The product C, when reacted with D (which is H2), produces E. So C + 2 H2 → E. If E is a gas, perhaps it's a hydrocarbon, or an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with hydrogen to form a metal and water. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But in that case, E would be Cu, which is a solid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, if E is a gas, maybe it's some kind of diatomic molecule. Another possibility is that E is something like NH3, but I don't think that's produced from C + H2.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonyl compound. For example, perhaps C is CO, which is a gas, but that's not a bright red solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a polynuclear compound.

Wait, let's try to approach this differently. Let's look at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces two different acids.

So, C must be a salt that, when dissolved in water, hydrolyzes to produce two acids. That's a bit tricky. One possibility is that C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, maybe C is a nitro salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite, which when hydrolyzed produces H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and another acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a polyatomic ion salt. For instance, perhaps C is ammonium sulfide, (NH4)2S. When it reacts with water, it would produce NH3 (a weak base) and H2S (a weak acid). But in reaction 3, F and G are acids, so this might not fit.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like MgCO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce Mg(OH)2 (a weak base) and CO2 (which is a weak acid in water). So again, F and G would be a base and an acid. But in the problem, both F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like NH4N3 (ammonium azide?), which when hydrolyzed gives HN3 (which is a weak acid) and NH4OH (which is weak as well). Hmm, not matching F and G as strong and weak.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacting with water produces NaOH (strong base) and H2O2 (which is an oxidizing agent but not a strong acid). Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, another thought. Maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, calcium carbide (CaC2) reacts with water to form acetylene (C2H2, a weak acid in water?) and calcium hydroxide. Hmm, but that gives a base and a weak acid. Maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. For example, NH4NO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH (weak base). But in reaction 3, both products are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal hydride. For example, LiAlH4 reacts with water to produce LiAl(OH)4 and H2. But that produces a base and hydrogen gas, which isn't an acid.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. D is H2 (from reaction 4, where D + B → H, which is H2O, so D is H2, B is O2). So, reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is a product of C reacting with H2, perhaps it's a reduction reaction. So C could be a metal oxide, which when reduced with H2 gives a metal and water. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But then E would be Cu, which is a solid, not a gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas, so maybe C is a compound that upon reduction releases a gas.

Wait, another approach: if E is a highly hazardous gas, perhaps it's something like chlorine (Cl2), but how would that form from C and H2?

Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2? But those are gases, but perhaps not hazardous. Alternatively, maybe E is a gas like HCN, which is highly toxic. How would that form?

Hmm, perhaps C is a chloride. Let me think: C could be carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), but that's a liquid, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe C is something else. But wait, reaction 3 produces F and G as acids, so if C is CCl4, reacting with water would not produce acids, because CCl4 is inert in water. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a halide. For example, if C is AgCl, it's a solid. But AgCl is white, not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps C is HgS, which is red. HgS is a red solid. That could fit the bright red description.

So if C is HgS, then what?

Reaction 3: HgS + H2O → A + F + G.

HgS is mercuric sulfide, which is also known as cinnabar, a bright red solid. When it reacts with water, does it produce anything? Well, HgS is relatively unreactive with water, but under certain conditions, perhaps it could decompose. Alternatively, maybe it's treated with strong acids.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think again. If C is HgS, then HgS is the product of reaction 1. So reaction 1 is A + 8 B → HgS.

HgS is a compound of Hg and S. So A and B must supply Hg and S. B is O2, from reaction 4 (D is H2, B is O2, H is H2O).

Wait, if B is O2, then reaction 1 is A + 8 O2 → HgS. But HgS contains neither O, so where is the O2 used? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps my earlier assumption that B is O2 is incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider other possibilities for B and D. Let me reevaluate reaction 4.

Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D and B are gases that react in 1:1 ratio to form a solvent.

If H is ethanol, then D and B would need to form C2H5OH. But I'm not sure how that would happen from gases. Alternatively, H could be methanol. How would that form from gases? Maybe CO + H2 → CH3OH with a catalyst. But then, D would be H2, B would be CO, and H is CH3OH. But that's a possible reaction.

Wait, but if H is CH3OH, then D is H2 and B is CO. Let's see.

So, reaction 4: CO + H2 → CH3OH. That would require a catalyst, like in the Fischer-Tropsch process, but perhaps it's possible. Alternatively, maybe H is a different solvent.

Alternatively, if H is NH3, which is a gas but can be a solvent when liquefied. So reaction 4 would be N2 + H2 → NH3. But that's a 1:1 ratio only if it's 1 N2 and 3 H2 → 2 NH3. No, that's not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is HCl. Then reaction 4 would be H2 + Cl2 → HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O. Then D and B are H2 and O2. Reaction 4 would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 1:1 ratio of H2 and O2 in moles if considering 2 H2 and 1 O2. Wait, but 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the mole ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should think of D and B as CO and H2, producing methanol (CH3OH) as H. So in reaction 4, CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. That's a 1:2 ratio, which doesn't match the 1:1 ratio given. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is CO2. But CO2 is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is CH4, but that's a gas and not typically a solvent in large quantities.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, but the mole ratio for D and B is 2:1, which doesn't match the 1:1 given. So I'm stuck on reaction 4.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about the product E. It's extremely hazardous. So E is a dangerous substance. What are some highly hazardous gases? Cl2, HCN, NO, NH3 (toxic but not extremely so), H2S, etc. Alternatively, perhaps E is a radioactive gas, but I don't think that's what the question is about.

If E is Cl2, how would it form? From C + 2 D → Cl2. If D is H2, then C + 2 H2 → Cl2. That would require C to be something that when reacted with H2 produces Cl2. Not sure about that.

Alternatively, if E is HCN, then perhaps C is a cyanide salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2, but those aren't extremely hazardous in their pure form. Alternatively, perhaps E is a phosgene or another toxic gas, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of a decomposition reaction. For example, if C is ammonium dichromate, which decomposes to form Cr2O3, NH3, and other products. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of a redox reaction. For example, if C is Fe(OH)3, and D is H2, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about each reaction again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid). B is a gas. Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (hazardous gas). Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent). 

From reaction 4, D and B are gases in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Perhaps H is NH3. So D is NH3, but that's a gas, but some reactions can form it. Wait, but in reaction 4, D and B would be gases, so maybe D is H2 and B is NH3. But NH3 is a gas at room temperature, but it's more common as a liquid under pressure. Wait, but H is a solvent. So if H is NH3, it's a liquid when compressed. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: think about the product E and its symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Point groups: C2 is a 2-fold rotation axis. D4h has a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. D∞h is like D4h but with an infinite fold, like in a cylinder. C2v has a 2-fold rotation and vertical mirror planes.

Which of these is associated with a highly symmetric molecule, perhaps a diatomic or a molecule with a center of symmetry?

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, their point group would be D∞h because diatomic molecules have a center of symmetry and a C2 axis, along with other symmetry elements leading to D∞h. Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, it would be D∞h.

Wait, another thought: if E is O2, which has a D∞h symmetry. Similarly, Cl2 also has D∞h symmetry.

So if E is O2 or Cl2, the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But earlier, I thought reaction 4 might involve H2 and O2 to form H2O. So if E is O2, that would tie back to reaction 2: C + 2 D → O2.

But if D is H2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → O2. That would imply that C is a compound that when reduced with H2 produces O2. That's a bit odd, as H2 is a reducing agent. So C would have to be something that can be oxidized to O2, perhaps?

Wait, C is a bright red solid. If C is a metal oxide that upon reaction with H2 produces the metal and water, which isn't producing O2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2. So reaction 2 would be C + 2 H2 → Cl2. That would imply C is a chloride that reacts with H2 to produce Cl2. For example, if C is CH3Cl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like NaCl. But NaCl is a solid, and when reacted with H2, it wouldn't produce Cl2. Unless it's a decomposition reaction, but that's unclear.

Wait, maybe C is a chlorate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps E is CO2. But CO2 is a linear molecule, so its point group is D∞h. So if E is CO2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C. But is CO2 hazardous? It's not extremely hazardous, but it can cause asphyxiation in high concentrations.

Hmm, but the question states that E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So its point group would be D∞h.

But I'm not sure if I'm on the right track with the reactions. Let me see.

If E is phosgene (COCl2), then reaction 2: C + 2 D → COCl2. How would that happen? Let's think about D. If D is H2, then reaction would be C + 2 H2 → COCl2. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2, but then reaction 4 would be D (Cl2) + B → H (solvent). If H is HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

If F is HCl (strong acid) and G is H2CO3 (weak acid), then C would have to be a carbonate that when hydrolyzed gives HCl and H2CO3. Wait, but that would imply C is a chlorinated carbonate, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water would give NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But F and G are acids, so that's not matching.

Wait, another idea: if C is a nitride, like NH4N3. Reacting with water would produce HN3 (a weak acid) and NH4OH (a weak base). Again, not matching F and G as both acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, BaO2 reacts with H2O to produce Ba(OH)2 and O2. But that produces a base and a gas, not acids.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to make some educated guesses.

Let's summarize what I have so far:

- Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent)
- H is likely H2O, but the mole ratio is 2:1 for H2 and O2, which doesn't fit 1:1.
- Alternatively, H is another solvent, like CH3OH, but its formation would require CO and H2 in a 1:2 ratio, which doesn't fit.

Maybe a different approach: think of C as a compound that when reacted with D (H2) produces E (maybe HCN). HCN is a highly toxic gas. So, reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → HCN + something.

Wait, HCN is produced from reactions involving cyanide. So perhaps C is a cyanide salt. For instance, NaCN reacts with H2 to produce HCN and NaH. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 2 is C (a cyanide) + H2 → HCN + other products. Let me think: if C is NaCN, then NaCN + H2 → HCN + NaH. But I'm not sure if that's a real reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)4) decomposes to form Ni and CO. But that doesn't seem to lead to E as a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, HNO2 (nitrous acid) is a weak acid, but again, not matching reaction 3.

Wait, going back to the product E. If E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, its point group is D∞h. So the correct answer would be option C.

But let's see if that makes sense with the other reactions.

If E is Cl2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → Cl2.

Assuming D is H2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → Cl2.

So C would have to be something that when reacted with H2 produces Cl2. Perhaps C is CCl2F2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, perhaps C is CH2Cl2. When it reacts with H2, maybe it decomposes. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloroalkane, like CH2Cl2. When it's heated with a catalyst, it might decompose, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 2 is a decomposition of C into Cl2 and something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O2. Then, reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → O2. If D is H2, then C would have to be something that when reacted with H2 produces O2. For example, perhaps C is a metal oxide that upon reaction with H2 produces the metal and water, which doesn't produce O2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2. But reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2. If D is H2, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate. For example, PbO2 (lead dioxide) is a bright yellow solid, but if C is something else, like mercury(II,IV) oxide, which is red. When it reacts with H2, perhaps it decomposes into Hg and water, but that doesn't produce O2.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible answers.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, its symmetry is D∞h. So the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2 or HCN, it's also D∞h. So I think the answer is D∞h, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of chemical reactions, and the goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options provided are based on molecular point groups: **C2**, **D4h**, **D∞h**, and **C2v**. To solve this, the reactions and products must be analyzed to identify the nature of E and its symmetry.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 4**:  
   - D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent).  
   - H is likely a common solvent. If H is **H2O**, then D and B would be **H2** and **O2**, respectively. However, the stoichiometry of H2 and O2 (2:1) does not match the 1:1 ratio given. This suggests H might be another solvent, such as **CH3OH** or **NH3**, but the exact identity remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 1**:  
   - A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid).  
   - C is a bright red solid. Possible candidates include **HgS** (mercuric sulfide), which is red and inert in water. However, the role of B (likely O2) in forming C is unclear, as O2 is not directly involved in forming HgS.

3. **Reaction 2**:  
   - C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous gas).  
   - E is highly hazardous, suggesting it could be a toxic gas like **Cl2**, **HCN**, or **phosgene (COCl2)**. These gases are linear molecules, which typically have **D∞h** symmetry.

4. **Reaction 3**:  
   - C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).  
   - This indicates C reacts with water to produce two acids. If C is **HgS**, it does not hydrolyze to form acids, so this suggests C might be a different compound, such as a sulfite or nitride. However, the exact identity of C remains ambiguous.

5. **Symmetry of E**:  
   - If E is a diatomic molecule like **Cl2** or **CO2**, its molecular symmetry group is **D∞h**.  
   - If E is a linear molecule like **HCN** or **phosgene (COCl2)**, it also has **D∞h** symmetry.  
   - Given the options and the nature of E as a highly hazardous gas, **D∞h** is the most plausible symmetry group.

### Conclusion:  
Based on the analysis, E is likely a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry, consistent with highly hazardous gases like Cl2, CO2, HCN, or phosgene. 

**Answer: C**
