Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question here about isomerism, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism has to do with molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are also called enantiomers. They are stereoisomers that cause plane-polarized light to rotate in opposite directions.

The question gives me four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, I need to understand each structure to see if they have any chiral centers or if they can exhibit stereoisomerism.

The options are:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

Let's take each one:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl groups are connected by a single bond, so the two phenyl rings can rotate relative to each other. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The nitro groups are at 6' and 6, and the ester groups (since it's dimethyl) are at 2 and 2'. The question is, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Wait, the molecule is [1,1'-biphenyl], which means the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at 2, 2', 6, and 6'. Let me draw this in my mind. Each ring has a carboxylate ester group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. So each phenyl ring is symmetrical? If the substituents are in para positions on each ring, does that create any chirality?

Wait, the biphenyl itself—does it have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are on both rings, perhaps the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry, maybe it is chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are on both rings, but in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Suppose each ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has two groups. Are those groups arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system allows for the possibility of cis or trans isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. Wait, but wait. If the biphenyl is connected in such a way that the substituents create a chiral center, then it would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but each substituent is on a benzene ring, not on a carbon chain, so perhaps no chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the entire biphenyl structure could create a chiral axis or something else.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the other compounds first and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is an ester. Let me break it down. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH2OH)CH2COO- but as an ester, it would be OMe attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure is O
       ||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH2-C(OH)H-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO^- but 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO^-.

Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, let's write the structure. The ester is OMe connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to another CH2 group which has an OH. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate part is CH2CH(OH)COO^- (since propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-; 2-hydroxy would add OH on the second carbon). So when esterified, it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So looking for chiral centers here. The CH(OH) group: the carbon attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2 group. Wait, let me count the substituents on that carbon.

The central carbon (second carbon) has:

- one CH2 group (from the COO group, but wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the ester group. Then, connected to that is the propionyl group. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

The ester is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right. The 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, so the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, that carbon in the middle (CH(OH)), connected to:

- CH3 (on one side)
- OH (on another)
- COOCH3 (another group)
- and CH2? No, wait, it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think of the carbon chain.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So, when esterified, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with an OH on the second CH2.

Wait, no, wait. The formula would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are: COOCH3, then CH2, then another CH2 with OH.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me try again.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH.

Wait, that might make more sense. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When it's the methyl ester, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the chiral centers. The carbon in the middle (the one attached to OH) has four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another hydrogen? Or maybe it's connected to two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Let's see the structure: 

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (the one with OH) has:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH (substituent)
- and a hydrogen atom.

Wait, no, because the formula is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply a central carbon connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH somewhere. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHOH connected to COOCH3?

Wait, no. Let me think of propanoate: three carbons. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the middle carbon in the chain is carbon 2, which has an OH, and it's connected to two CH2 groups. So the substituents on that carbon would be two CH2 groups (from either side), an OH, and a hydrogen? That can't be because that would mean two CH2 groups on the same carbon, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: The structure must be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because the formula would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H?

Wait, that would make four substituents: yes. So each is different. So that carbon is a chiral center. Because it's connected to four different groups.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So it can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 would show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is diphenyl ketone. So, it's (Ph)2CO. Each phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon.

So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups and a ketone group. Wait, no. Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, which is a carbonyl group with two phenyl groups attached.

So the structure is: 

Ph–CO–Ph

The carbonyl carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and the oxygen (double bond). Wait, no, carbonyl is O double bonded to C, which is connected to two Ph groups. So the carbonyl carbon is only attached to two Ph groups and the oxygen (double bond). So does that carbon have four substituents? No, because double bonds don't count as substituents in the same way. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized. So it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis or trans diastereomer of maleate. Wait, wait. Fumaric acid is a di-carboxylic acid with two double bonds. Let me think. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid.

Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester with two methyl groups, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So when it's the dimethyl ester, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. Wait, the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, does this molecule have any stereoisomerism? Well, because of the double bond, it can have geometric isomerism (cis and trans). But what about optical isomerism?

Wait, but geometric isomerism is about the arrangement around a double bond, not about chirality. For a molecule to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. So each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond. So in this structure, are there any chiral centers? Each of the carbons in the ester groups is connected to O, but they're part of the ester group.

Wait, the central double bond is C=C. The two carbons on either side of the double bond each have two ester groups. So each of those carbons is attached to two ester groups (O-CO-OCH3), and the double bond.

Wait, but each of those carbons is connected to two ester groups and two other groups. No, wait, the structure is:

- Each of the two middle carbons (the ones attached to the double bond) is connected to two ester groups.

Wait, no. Each of those carbons is connected to two ester groups (O-CO-OCH3), but wait, fumarate is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the dimethyl ester would be (CH2CO₂Me) groups on either side. Wait, no, fumarate is trans, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But this is a planar structure. Do any of the carbons have four different substituents? The carbons on either end of the double bond are each connected to:

- Two O-CO-OCH3 groups
- One double bond
- One hydrogen (since the structure is CH₂(CO₂Me)-CH₂(CO₂Me) in a trans configuration? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the dimethyl ester would be CH₂(CO₂Me)-CH=CH-CO₂Me, but in trans configuration.

Wait, that's not right. Let me think again. Fumarate is an (E) diacid: the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides. So the structure is:

COOH-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, fumarate is CH₂(COOH)-CH=CH-(COOH)CH₂? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The two carboxylic acid groups are on the same carbon, but that's not possible. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same ends of the double bond in a trans configuration.

So when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In a trans configuration.

Now, the central carbons (the ones attached to the double bond) each have two ester groups, a double bond, and another substituent. Wait, each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups and two other groups?

Wait, no. Let me imagine each of the two central carbons:

Each has two CH₂ groups, but that's not correct.

Wait, the structure is more accurately:

Each of the two central carbons is connected to:

- One ester group (O-CO-OCH3)
- One double bond (so each is double-bonded to the adjacent carbon)
- And two more substituents.

Wait, maybe each has a methyl group from the ester and another group? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Each of the central carbons is attached to a carbonyl oxygen and a double bond. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to:

- One O-CO-OCH3 group
- One double bond (so, each is connected to two other C's via double bonds)
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is attached to two ester groups. Wait, no, each is attached to one ester group. Wait, let me think of the actual structure.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid: O=C-(CH=CH)-CO=O.

As the dimethyl ester, it would be O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration, meaning the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to:

- One ester group (O-CO-OCH3)
- One double bond (so each is connected to the adjacent carbon via double bond)
- And two other substituents, which are each a methyl group from the ester?

Wait, no, because the ester is O-CO-OCH3, which is a substituent on the carbonyl group. So the central carbons are each bonded to:

- One carbonyl group (each has a double bond to O)
- And each is double-bonded to the other central carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the point. Let's think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

A chiral center must have four different substituents. Are any of the carbons in dimethyl fumarate a chiral center?

The central carbons are each bonded to:

- One carbonyl group (O)
- One double bond (so each is connected to the other central carbon)
- And two other substituents.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂-COOCH3, but with a double bond. No, that's not right. Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl ester would be (COOCH3)₂ on each end, with the double bond in the middle.

So each central carbon (the ones in the double bond) has:

- One COOCH3 group
- One double bond (so each is connected to the next carbon)
- And two more substituents, which would be hydrogens. Wait, no, because the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH₂(COOCH3), but that's not correct. Wait, the structure is actually two carbonyl groups on either end of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the central carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One double bond to the other central carbon
- And two hydrogens.

So each central carbon has the groups: COOCH3, two H, and a double bond to the other central carbon.

Wait, but double bonds are between two atoms, so each is bonded to the other. So each central carbon in the double bond has:

- COOCH3
- Double bond to the other central carbon
- Two H's.

So each of these carbons has three groups: COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. Wait, that's only three substituents. So each has three substituents and a double bond.

Therefore, each of these carbons is sp² hybridized, not sp³. So they can't be chiral centers because chiral centers are sp³ with four substituents.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, there are no chiral centers. However, the molecule can have geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. Fumarate is (E), which is trans. So the dimethyl fumarate would have a certain configuration. But can it have enantiomers?

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral. Let me see. If the molecule is symmetric, then it won't have a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, is there a plane of symmetry? If the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule might be symmetric across the double bond. Because each side mirrors the other.

Wait, in the trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. Thus, it would not be chiral and would not have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about whether the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image. If the molecule is symmetric, its mirror image would be identical. If not, then the mirror image would be a different enantiomer.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, being trans, it's symmetric. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the dimethyl fumarate is in the cis configuration, would that lead to a chiral molecule? Because for cis, the two ester groups are on the same side. But in that case, each of the central carbons would have:

- COOCH3
- Two H's (maybe)
- And a double bond.

Wait, no. Let me consider cis (Z) isomer. For cis, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So the structure would have both COOCH3 groups on the same side.

But would that make the molecule chiral? Let's see.

Each central carbon in the double bond would have:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- And a double bond.

No, each central carbon is in a double bond, so they're sp² hybridized. So they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, but maybe the entire molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, so perhaps dimethyl fumarate, whether cis or trans, doesn't have any chiral centers. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I thought that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Wait, maleate is in the cis configuration, and fumarate is trans. Wait, no, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. So the dimethyl esters would be dimethyl maleate (cis) and dimethyl fumarate (trans).

But in either case, would the molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think of another approach. The presence of a chiral center requires four different substituents on an sp³ carbon. So, in dimethyl fumarate, are there any such carbons?

The ester groups are O-CO-OCH3. The carbons in the ester groups are connected to the oxygen, but those are not chiral centers. The central carbons in the double bond are not chiral centers either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the ester groups themselves have some branching. No, each ester is O-CO-OCH3, which is a simple group.

Wait, unless the molecule has a stereogenic center elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, in the ester, each carboxylic acid becomes a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Arranged in a trans configuration.

So, each central carbon is connected to:

- The COOCH3 group
- The double bond (so connected to the other central carbon)
- Two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, no, each central carbon is connected to two substituents: COOCH3 and two H's. Because each is part of the double bond.

So each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and a double bond. So they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different groups.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. So option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Because dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, perhaps the question is not about that.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Are there any chiral centers in any of the compounds?

So, the first compound, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Let me imagine the structure. Biphenyl connected at position 1 and 1'. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

But because the rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', are the substituents on each ring arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring make the molecule asymmetric, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, but the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are planar. So, unless there's a chiral center attached to the rings, the molecule itself won't be chiral.

Wait, but the biphenyl structure can have a twist, but that's more about conformation, not stereochemistry. So, perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetric, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in a way that they create a chiral axis or plane, then the molecule might have chirality. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So, each ring has two substituents, which are para to each other. So, for each ring, the substituents are in para positions, making the ring symmetrical.

So, each ring is symmetrical, and the biphenyl connects them. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1', which are the same positions, so the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center.

So, the first compound doesn't show optical isomerism.

Now, let me summarize what each compound does:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No optical isomerism. Because the molecule is symmetrical, no chiral centers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, has a chiral center. So optical isomerism exists.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought that dimethyl fumarate is a trans isomer, but perhaps I'm wrong about it not having a chiral center. Let me double-check.

Wait, another way: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. For dimethyl fumarate (trans), does it have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So, mirroring across that plane would result in the same molecule. Therefore, it's not chiral.

Thus, among the four compounds, only option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me go back to option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Another approach: The molecule could have a chiral center if any of the carbons in the structure has four different substituents.

Looking at the structure again, perhaps the two ester groups are on opposite sides, but maybe there's a stereogenic center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the central carbons in the double bond are not the only ones; perhaps other carbons are involved.

Wait, but the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Each of the central carbons is bonded to COOCH3, two H's, and a double bond. So, no, each has three substituents. So no chiral centers.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

So option D is 1 and 2. But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 1.

Let me re-visit compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with each ring substituted at positions 2 and 6. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

So, each ring is symmetrical in terms of substituents (para substitution), so each ring has a plane of symmetry. The biphenyl connects the two rings at positions 1 and 1'.

But does the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Imagine looking at the molecule from the side. The two rings are connected, and each has substituents at 2 and 6. So, when the rings are in a certain conformation, the substituents may be arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents on each ring are on the same face, the molecule could be chiral. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a center of inversion, then it will be achiral. If not, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the rings, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on the rings are arranged in a way that they're not mirror images, the molecule could be chiral.

Hmm. Another thought: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

But considering that each ring has two substituents in para positions, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the overall structure non-symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the same side of each ring, leading to a chiral structure.

Wait, but without knowing the exact spatial arrangement of the substituents, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound 1 is meso. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, but the molecule overall is chiral because of the arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl system is such that the two rings are connected in a way that allows for a chiral arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry.

Another approach: the biphenyl group can have different diastereomers if the substituents are in specific positions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, for example, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each substituent is para to each other. So, each ring is symmetric. The biphenyl connects at 1 and 1', which are the same points. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the biphenyl, making it achiral.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

That brings me back to only compound 2 as correct. But in the options, the only option that includes only 2 is option A (which includes 1,2,4) and D (1 and 2). Since 1 is incorrect, D is out, and option A includes 4, which I thought was incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 is incorrect. So perhaps I was wrong about 4.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Looking at the structure of dimethyl fumarate:

It's (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In the trans configuration.

Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to:

- One ester group (O-CO-OCH3)
- One double bond (so connected to the other central carbon)
- And two H's.

So each central carbon has:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- Double bond (which is connected to the next carbon)

But wait, the double bond is between two carbons, so each has two substituents from the double bond. So each has:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- And the double bond to another carbon.

So, each central carbon has three substituents plus the double bond. So they're sp² hybridized, not sp³. Therefore, they can't be chiral centers.

So, no chiral centers in compound 4. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back at the options, none of the options say only 2.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, there's no option where only 2 is correct. So one of my earlier analyses must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again about it.

Wait, what if the molecule is such that one of the ester groups is on a chiral center?

Wait, the ester groups are on the carbonyl, which is double-bonded, so those carbons are sp², not chiral.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Another possibility: the dimethyl fumarate has a stereogenic center at the ester groups. No, because the ester carbons are connected to three groups, not four.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fumarate structure is such that the central carbons are bonded to four different groups, making them chiral centers.

Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Imagine the structure:

The dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In the trans configuration. The two central carbons are each connected to:

- One ester group (COOCH3)
- One double bond to the other central carbon
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, that makes three substituents. So, no, not a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm stuck because according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options reflect that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think of another way.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate has a cis configuration, which might lead to a chiral center.

Wait, no. The structure of dimethyl maleate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In the cis configuration. Are any of the central carbons chiral?

Each central carbon is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- Double bond.

So again, three substituents, no, so no chiral centers.

Hmm. So, perhaps I was correct in thinking that none of the options have only 2, so perhaps I'm wrong about another compound.

Wait, let me check compound 1 again. Is there a possibility that it has a chiral center?

The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other, making each ring symmetrical. The biphenyl connects at 1 and 1', so the two rings are symmetrical relative to the central bond.

So, the entire molecule is symmetrical, which means it can't be chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry? For example, if the nitro groups are on the same face of each ring and the ester groups on the opposite face, perhaps leading to chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that the substituents on each ring don't produce a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Hmm. Without a clear structure, it's hard to tell, but I think the para substitution on each ring leads to a symmetrical molecule, meaning no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to only compound 2 showing optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing another compound.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 1,2,4. So if compounds 1 and 4 also show optical isomerism, then option A would be correct.

But I thought compounds 1 and 4 don't have chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let's think about whether compound 4 can have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the dimethyl fumarate is not a symmetrical molecule. Because the two substituents on either side of the double bond are the same (both COOCH3), but arranged in a trans configuration. So, perhaps the molecule is achiral because of this symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents were different, the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, since both substituents are the same, the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, another thought: if the two substituents on the double bond are the same, then the molecule is not chiral. But if they are different, then the molecule could be chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, both substituents are the same, so the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral.

So, I think only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate: is it (E)-configuration, meaning the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

But what about the possibility of atropisomerism? Atropisomers are conformational isomers that are not interconvertible due to a high barrier to rotation. But that's not optical isomerism; it's a different type of isomerism.

So, perhaps the molecule doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm. Let me now consider the possibility that I made a mistake about compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it would be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring is symmetrical, but perhaps the arrangement of the two rings leads to asymmetry.

Alternatively, if the two rings are connected in a way that they're not mirror images, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', so the two rings are in a fixed position. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that can't be mirrored, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are on the same face, making the structure chiral.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's hard to tell. However, if the rings are connected in such a way that the substituents are not mirror images, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, but where would the chiral center be? The substituents are on aromatic rings, which are planar. Unless there's a chiral center attached to the rings, the molecule won't be chiral.

Wait, unless the biphenyl system itself can lead to chirality. Biphenyls can have axial chirality if there's a substituent on each ring that prevents the molecule from having a plane of symmetry.

But in this case, each ring has two substituents (nitro at 6, ester at 2), which are para to each other. So each ring is symmetrical. The biphenyl connects at 1 and 1', so the molecule is symmetrical across the central axis.

Therefore, the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, again, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4. Let me see another approach.

Wait, another way to think about this: if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, which could create a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But, what if the substituents are in a way that there's no plane of symmetry?

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, so the molecule is symmetrical. Thus, it's not chiral.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2.

Wait, let me check the options again:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D)1,2

So, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me think again about it.

Wait, is there a possibility that compound 1 has a chiral center?

The structure is a biphenyl, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The substituents are nitro groups and ester groups.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl is such that the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face, making the molecule chiral.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, which would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a center of chirality.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find which compounds have a chiral center.

Only compound 2 has a chiral center. So, the answer should be option A (1,2,4) if I'm missing something, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: the ester groups are in a trans configuration, but perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In the trans configuration. Each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- Double bond.

So, no, they don't have four different substituents.

Wait, but wait. Each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3
- H
- H
- Another carbon (the other central carbon in the double bond).

Wait, but that's four substituents. Wait, each is connected to COOCH3, two H's, and a CH₂ group? No, because it's a double bond, so each is connected to the other carbon via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing substituents with bonds.

In any case, each of those carbons is sp² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers.

Hmm.

So, after all this, I think only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about compound 4.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecule has a stereogenic center in the ester groups. But each ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbons in the ester are:

- The carbonyl carbon (sp², not chiral)
- The methyl group (sp³, but attached to three O's and a methyl, so not four different substituents)

No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, no, fumarate is a diester across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, no, the substituents are on the same carbon as the double bond.

Hmm. I'm stuck. 

Since I'm time-constrained, I'll have to make a decision. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4.

Wait, no. Let me think again about compound 4. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are on the same side, it's also not chiral because both substituents are the same.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl maleate (cis), the molecule has two ester groups on the same side, but since both are the same, the molecule is not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, I think the only correct answer is option 2. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry.

In the trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So, if you imagine a plane cutting through the double bond, the two ester groups mirror each other. So the molecule is symmetrical, thus not chiral.

So, no optical isomerism in 4.

So, only compound 2 is correct. But since the options don't have that, I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4's structure. Let me think differently. Suppose the molecule is not symmetrical because the substituents are not on the same type of carbons. For example, if the substituents are on different carbons, perhaps leading to a chiral center.

Wait, no, the substituents are on the same carbons.

Hmm. Well, given the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D. Since I've determined that only 2 is correct, and the options don't reflect that, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center in the ester groups. The ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbon attached to the oxygen in the ester is CH3, which is connected to OCOOR. Wait, that's a tertiary carbon, but it's not a chiral center because it's attached to three identical groups (maybe? No, the groups are OCOOR, two CH3 groups, and another group? No, wait.)

No, the ester group is O-CO-OCH3, so the carbon connected to the oxygen is the methyl group, which is CH3. So the ester carbons are not chiral.

So, I think I have to conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. Perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Maybe the biphenyl structure allows for optical isomerism.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images.

But without more structural information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the rings are such that the molecule has a chiral axis, making it exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other features that allow for non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Optical isomerism requires chirality, which arises when a molecule has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or a non-centrosymmetric arrangement that lacks a plane of symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on each ring are para to each other, and the biphenyl connection introduces a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom in the middle (the one bonded to OH, CH₃, COOCH₃, and H) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups. This makes the molecule capable of exhibiting optical isomerism (enantiomers).

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two phenyl groups, making it sp² hybridized. Since it does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) ester of fumaric acid, with the structure:  
   $$\text{O}=\text{C}-\text{OCH}_3 \quad \text{C=C} \quad \text{O}=\text{C}-\text{OCH}_3$$  
   The two central carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and bonded to two ester groups and two hydrogens. These carbons are not chiral centers because they do not have four different substituents. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (compound 2) exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds have chiral centers or lack symmetry to exhibit optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options correctly reflect this conclusion. Based on the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **A (1, 2, 4)**, though this choice is inconsistent with the analysis.
