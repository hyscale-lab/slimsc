Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let's see what I can figure out.

The problem says that the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, I think it's supposed to be L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like a Yukawa coupling kind of interaction. The boson X is coupling to fermions with a coupling strength λ and a coupling constant v, which is probably the vacuum expectation value or something like that.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

In particle physics, for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the fermion must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the total rest mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of the decaying particle.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion f that has a mass m_f where 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV would be allowed. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but let me think in terms of known particles. Let me list the masses of the known fermions.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But top is way too heavy. The up, down, strange, charm, and bottom. Let's remember their masses.

Wait, the typical masses are:

- Up quark: around 2 MeV (million eV)
- Down quark: about 4-5 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV (way too heavy, X is 6 GeV)

Leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. But neutrinos are negligible in mass, so when considering charged leptons:

- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV

So for the fermions, we can pair each with their antiparticle. So possible decay channels would be X → f f̄, where the sum of the fermion masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but for each pair, it's 2m_f ≤ m_X. Because each fermion has mass m_f, so 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's see:

- Up, down, strange, charm, and bottom quarks. The bottom is about 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. Wait, no. Wait, 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV. So bottom quarks would require X mass at least 9 GeV to decay into b b̄. But X is only 6 GeV, so 2m_b = 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I have the masses wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the masses. Let me think again.

Charm quark mass: around 1.5 GeV. So 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV.

Bottom quark: about 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5=9 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Tau lepton: about 1.78 GeV. So 2*tau mass is about 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6? No, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. Wait, no. 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So maybe X can decay into tau+ tau-.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for the tau pair, each tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. 3.56 is less than 6, so that's allowed.

So, which fermions have masses such that 2m_f ≤6 GeV?

Let's list all possible fermions and check:

Quarks:
- u: 2 MeV → 2m_u = 4 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed
- d: ~5 MeV → allowed
- s: ~100 MeV → allowed
- c: ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV → allowed
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed
- t: way too heavy, X can't decay into top.

Leptons:
- e: 0.511 MeV → allowed
- mu: ~105.7 MeV → allowed
- tau: ~1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

So, X can decay into any of these fermion-antifermion pairs except for b b̄ and t t̄. So the possible decay channels are:

uū, dđ, sŝ, cč, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, mu+ mu-.

Wait, but the problem is about the decay into a pair of fermions. So the possible decay modes are into any pair where each fermion's mass is ≤ 3 GeV.

So, which particles are considered? The fermions are quarks (u, d, s, c) and leptons (e, mu, tau).

So the decay options would include all of these. But wait, the problem is about the possible decay products. So the answer options list various combinations.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b has mass 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b=9 GeV >6, so X can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c has mass 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV, which is allowed. So c c̄ is allowed. So option B includes c and excludes b, which is correct. So B is a possibility.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, t is top quark, which is much heavier. So X can't decay into t t̄. So option C is incorrect because it includes t.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct options would be the ones that exclude b and t. So looking at the options, only option B and perhaps another.

Wait, option B includes c c̄, which is allowed. So B's decay channels are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But what about the up quark? Wait, the up quark's mass is so low that in reality, it's possible, but in terms of the problem, whether X can decay into u ū, yes.

So the allowed decays are all quarks except b, and all charged leptons (e, mu, tau). So the correct answer should list all of these except b and t.

Looking at the options, option B includes c, which is allowed, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

Wait, but looking at option B, where are the c quarks? Oh, yes, in option B, c is present, and that's correct.

So the allowed decays are all fermions except those with mass over 3 GeV. So the correct answer should include all fermions except b and t.

So, the correct answer is option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but what about the tau? 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

So looking at the options again:

Option B includes all except b and t, which are too heavy.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \). For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), we have \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses
- **Quarks**:  
  - \( u, d \): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV}, \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).  
  - \( s \): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).  
  - \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
  - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
  - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far too heavy).  

- **Leptons**:  
  - \( e \): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).  
  - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).  
  - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).  

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.  

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**: \( X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \).
