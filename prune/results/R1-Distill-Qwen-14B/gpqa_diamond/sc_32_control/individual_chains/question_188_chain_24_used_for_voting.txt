Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is calculated using something called the Bragg's law, but wait, no, Bragg's law is more about reflection. Oh right, the interplanar distance formula is derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane.

The crystal in question is rhombohedral. I think rhombohedral means all edges are equal, and all angles are equal too. Oh wait, no, actually, in a rhombohedral crystal, the three lattice parameters (a, b, c) are equal, but the angles might not all be 90 degrees. Wait, but in this problem, all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral or trigonal crystal. So the lattice is cubic with a = b = c, but angles are 30 degrees instead of 90. Wait no, a rhombohedral crystal has a = b = c, but angles can be different. But in this case, all are 30 degrees, so that makes it a special case, maybe like a trigonal crystal.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom. Wait, but in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice parameter. So a, the lattice parameter, is 10 Angstrom? Or is the interatomic distance a different thing? Hmm, wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in other structures it might vary. But wait, the problem says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So maybe the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom. So a = 10 A.

We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ) * sqrt( ... something with the angles )

Wait, no. The general formula for interplanar distance when the lattice is not cubic involves the lattice parameters and the angles. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Another approach is to use the structure factor and the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with the calculation involving the metric tensor.

Wait, maybe I should recall that for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h + k + l)(\cos \alpha + \cos \beta + \cos \gamma) + ... no, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for d is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha } }

Wait, but in a cubic system, all angles are 90 degrees, so the cos terms are zero, and it's just a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees each (alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees). So the formula would need to include those cosines.

So let's plug in for the (111) plane, where h=1, k=1, l=1.

So d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) )

Wait, because each angle is 30 degrees, so all the cos terms would be cos(30°). Let me compute each part.

First, h² +k² + l² = 1 +1+1=3.

Then, the other terms: 2hk cos gamma = 2*1*1 * cos(30) = 2*(√3/2) = √3.

Same for 2hl cos beta and 2kl cos alpha. Each of those is √3 as well.

Wait, since all angles are 30 degrees, all three terms would contribute √3 each. So the sum is:

3 + √3 + √3 + √3 = 3 + 3√3.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 3√3).

So d = a / sqrt(3 + 3√3).

But a is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, but wait, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Does that mean a is 10? Or is a different?

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might not be exactly 'a' because of the angles. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify this.

Wait, maybe in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance (the distance between nearest neighbors along the lattice vectors) is 'a'. Because each atom is at the corner of the rhombohedral unit cell, and the edges are length a. So the distance between nearest atoms would be a.

So yes, in this case, a is 10 Angstrom.

So substituting, d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3).

Let me compute the denominator.

3 + 3√3 = 3(1 + √3) ≈ 3*(1 + 1.732) = 3*2.732 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.491 Angstrom? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 8-10.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Because for the (111) plane in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3). So if a is 10, that would be about 5.773 Angstrom. But none of the options are that low. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha) } }

But in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees here.

So for (111), the denominator is:

1² +1² +1² + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) *3 (since all three angles are same).

So that's 3 + 3*(2*(1)(1)* (√3/2)).

Wait, let's compute each term:

2hk cos gamma: 2*1*1 * cos(30) = 2*(√3/2) = √3.

Same for the other terms, 2hl cos beta and 2kl cos alpha, each is √3. So total is 3 + 3*(√3).

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 3√3) as before.

Wait, but with a=10, this gives d=10/sqrt(3 +3√3).

Wait, let me compute that again.

3 +3√3 =3(1 +√3) ≈ 3*(2.732) ≈8.196.

sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom. But the options are around 8-10. So this can't be right. So I'm definitely making a mistake.

Wait a second, maybe I have the formula wrong. Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) (1 + \cos \alpha) } }.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) } } multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated, but let me think.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) ( 1, 1, 1 )
b2 = (1/a) (1, -1, -1)
b3 = (1/a) (-1, 1, -1)

Wait, no, that's for a cubic system. For a rhombohedral, with angles, it's more complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I think I can use the formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal system. The formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, but wait, no, I think the denominator is the sum of squares plus twice the cross terms with cosines of the angles between the axes.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

So for our case, h=1, k=1, l=1, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So substituting:

Denominator = 1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 )

Which is 3 + 2*(√3/2 + √3/2 + √3/2 )

Because cos30 = √3/2 ≈0.866.

So 2 * (3*(√3/2)) = 2*( (3√3)/2 )=3√3.

So denominator is 3 +3√3.

So sqrt(3 +3√3) is the denominator.

Wait, so d = a / sqrt(3 +3√3). Since a=10, this would be 10 / sqrt(3+3√3) ≈10/(2.863) ≈3.49 Angstrom. But none of the options are close to this. Hmmm.

So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming a is 10 Angstrom. Oh wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges, which are of length a. So a would indeed be 10 Angstrom. So that's correct.

Wait, but the interplanar distances are usually smaller than the lattice parameters. However, the options are 8-10 Angstrom, which is larger than what I'm getting. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Alternative approach: Maybe I need to calculate the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space. Hmmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps it's the volume of the unit cell involved.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should compute the volume of the unit cell first. The volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the interplanar distance is the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

In reciprocal space, the plane (hkl) corresponds to the reciprocal vector:

G = h a^* + k b^* + l c^*,

where a^*, b^*, c^* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

The magnitude of G is 1/d, according to Bragg's law.

Wait, so |G| = 1/d.

So, perhaps I should compute |G|.

The reciprocal basis vectors for a rhombohedral system are given by:

a^* = (1/a) (1, 1, 1)
b^* = (1/a) (1, -1, -1)
c^* = (1/a) (-1, 1, -1)

Wait, but this is for a cubic system. For a rhombohedral, the reciprocal vectors would involve the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal vectors are given by:

a^* = (1/a) * (1, 1, 1)
b^* = (1/a) * (1, -1, -1)
c^* = (1/a) * (-1, 1, -1)

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal vectors have more terms involving the angles. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Wait, I found that the formula for d is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } } * (1/a)

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, to get the formula correctly, I think I need to consult the metric tensor approach.

The metric tensor (g) is given in terms of the lattice vectors. For a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor can be written as:

g = [ [ a^2, a^2 cos gamma, a^2 cos beta ],
       [ a^2 cos gamma, a^2, a^2 cos alpha ],
       [ a^2 cos beta, a^2 cos alpha, a^2 ] ]

But wait, perhaps I got that mixed up. Alternatively, the metric tensor elements are:

g_11 = a^2
g_12 = a^2 cos gamma
g_13 = a^2 cos beta
g_22 = a^2
g_23 = a^2 cos alpha
g_33 = a^2

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice to find the interplanar distance.

In any case, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula specifically for rhombohedral systems.

I found that the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be calculated using:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

So for (111), h=k=l=1, and all angles are 30 degrees. So:

Denominator inside sqrt is:

1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1* cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 )

=3 + 2*(3*(√3/2)).

Because cos30 is √3/2.

So 2*(3*(√3/2))= 3√3.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +3√3).

So d = a / sqrt(3 +3√3).

With a=10, d=10/sqrt(3 +3√3).

Let me compute the denominator numerically.

3 +3√3 ≈3 +3*1.732≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d ≈10/2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But wait, the options are all around 8-10 Angstrom. That's way off. So I must have made a mistake in assuming a is 10.

Wait, wait. Oh, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which for a rhombohedral structure is a. Because in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corner, and the nearest neighbors are along the edges. So a is the edge length, so a=10 Angstrom.

But according to my calculation, d is about 3.49, but the options are 8.95 or 9.08, etc. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternative approach: Perhaps I should consider that the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, another thought. Maybe I have the reciprocal of the denominator. Let me check:

Wait, the formula for reciprocal is |G| = sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) / a.

Wait, so 1/d = |G|, so d = a / |G|.

Wait, that's what I had before. So same result.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the angles.

Wait, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, so for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(1 * 1 * cos30 + 1 * 1 * cos30 +1 * 1 * cos30 )) ?

Wait, yes, because h=1, k=1, l=1.

So 2*(hk cos gamma + ...) = 2*( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 ) = 6*(√3/2) )= 3√3.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +3√3).

So 10 / sqrt(3 +3√3) is about 3.49.

But the options are much higher. So maybe the given interatomic distance isn't 'a' but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms in the (111) plane? Or perhaps it's the diagonal distance. Hmm, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so the distance is 'a'.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Another possibility is that the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell first.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is given by:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

Since alpha=beta=gamma=30°, let's compute that.

cos30 = √3/2 ≈0.8660.

So:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*( (√3/2)^2 ) + 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) )

Compute each term:

(√3/2)^2 = 3/4 → 3*(3/4)=9/4=2.25.

(√3/2)^3= (3√3)/(8) ≈0.6495.

So 2*(3√3/8) )= (3√3)/4 ≈1.299.

So inside sqrt:

1 - 2.25 +1.299 ≈ (1 -2.25)= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049) ≈0.221.

So V = (10)^3 * 0.221 ≈1000 *0.221=221 A^3.

But how does this help? Maybe not directly.

Wait, but the interplanar distance d is related to the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Another approach: The formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

So using that, I get the same as before. Which gives d=3.49, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps the initial assumption that a=10 is wrong. But the problem says the interatomic distance is 10, which I think is a.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the structure is not simple cubic. For example, in a face-centered cubic or body-centered structure, the interatomic distance would be a√2/2 for fcc and a√3/3 for bcc. But wait, the problem states it's a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of cubic system. No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it a type of cubic?

Wait, rhombohedral is a form of the cubic system, where the angles are not 90 degrees. So in that case, the interatomic distance would still be 'a' because the atoms are at the cube corners.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Let me think again. The problem gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom. So a=10.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator again.

Wait, 3 +3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.49.

Wait, but none of the options are near that. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps it's a face-centered or body-centered structure. No, the problem states it's rhombohedral, which is a type of cubic system with a = b = c and angles not 90 degrees.

Wait, could the formula be different? Let's search for the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Upon checking my notes, I find that for a rhombohedral lattice with lattice constant a and angles α, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha} }

Wait, that's different. So perhaps in this case, all the angles are the same, so the formula simplifies to:

d= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator becomes:

1 +1 +1 + 2*(1+1+1) * cos30.

Which is 3 + 6*(√3/2).

Because cos30=√3/2.

So 6*(√3/2)=3√3 ≈5.196.

So denominator is 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, the options are around 9 Angstrom. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, in some sources, I see that the formula for rhombohedral is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl)(1 + \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, that's a different formula. Let me try that.

So substituting h=k=l=1, and α=30°, cos α=√3/2.

Denominator:

3 - (3)(1 + √3/2 )

Because (hk + hl + kl)= 3*(1*1) =3, and (1 + cos α) is 1 + √3/2.

So denominator inside sqrt:

3 -3*(1 + √3/2 ) =3 -3 - (3√3/2 )= - (3√3/2 )

But that's negative. Taking square root of negative number isn't possible. So that can't be right. So perhaps that formula isn't correct.

Another approach: Perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

Which brings me back to the same denominator as before. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal of the interplanar distance is given by the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as:

b1 = (1/a) (1,1,1)
b2 = (1/a) (1, -1, -1)
b3 = (1/a) (-1,1,-1)

Wait, but this is for a simple cubic system. For a rhombohedral, I think the formula is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is:

|G| = sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ) / a.

Wait, so |G|=sqrt(3 +3√3)/10.

But the interplanar distance d is 1/|G|.

So d=10 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )≈3.49. Still the same result.

So I must be missing something in the problem's setup.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't 'a' but something else. For instance, in a face-centered cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2/2. So perhaps in this problem, the interatomic distance is the distance between the nearest atoms, which could be a√2/2 if it's fcc. But wait, the problem says the crystal is rhombohedral, which is a cubic system with a = b =c and angles not 90°, but the structure could be different.

Wait, but the problem states it's a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of cubic system. So perhaps it's a simple cubic structure, with a=10. So that the nearest neighbor distance is 'a', so a=10. So I think my initial assumption is correct.

So perhaps the problem is not about the (111) plane in the rhombohedral lattice, but perhaps in a hexagonal close-packed system. But no, the problem says it's rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the denominator:

3 + 3√3 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options are A:9.08, B:8.95, etc. So maybe I did miscalculate.

Wait, wait. What if the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) ) ?

Wait, let me try that.

Denominator for (111):

3 - 2*(3) cos(30°).

=3 -6*(√3/2) =3 -3√3 ≈3 -5.196= -2.196.

Can't take square root of negative number. So that's invalid.

Hmm.

Another thought: Maybe the problem uses a different approach, like the Miller indices correspond to a different plane. Wait, no, the question says (111) plane.

Wait, perhaps the formula is  a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) * (1/ (1 + ... )).

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the crystal is actually a hexagonal system, but the question says rhombohedral. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse-engineer the options. Let's compute each option's denominator.

Looking at option B: 8.95 Angstrom.

Then, 10/d = sqrt(3 +3√3 ).

So, 10/8.95 ≈1.116.

But sqrt(3+3√3 ) is approximately sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 1/2.863 ≈0.349. 10 *0.349 ≈3.49. So no, that doesn't match.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I have the formula upside down. Let me see:

If d=10 * sqrt(3 +3√3 ), then 10*2.863≈28.63, which is way larger than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) * something else. For cubic, it's a/sqrt(3)≈5.77. But options are larger, so perhaps I'm missing a scaling factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of the lattice parameters. Wait, in some sources, the lattice vectors are defined such that the vectors are a, b, c with angles between them. So perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else.

Wait, another approach: The unit cell is rhombohedral, a=10, angles 30°. The (111) plane has a certain spacing. Perhaps I can compute the volume of the unit cell and then use the formula involving the volume and the Miller indices.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ) ).

Substituting alpha=30°, cos30=√3/2.

Compute 1 -3*(3/4) +2*( (3√3)/8 )

=1 -9/4 + (3√3/4 )

= (4/4 -9/4) + (3√3/4 )

= (-5/4) + (3√3/4 )

≈-1.25 + 1.299 ≈0.049.

So V=10^3 * sqrt(0.049 )≈1000 *0.221≈221 A^3.

The formula for interplanar distance in terms of volume is d = a / ( |hkl| * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (2*V) ) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, the formula for the number of lattice planes is V/(d * h k l ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the spacing in terms of the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector.

Wait, perhaps it's better to give up and look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane's interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

Wait, why 6 cos30? Because h, k, l are 1, so perhaps 3 terms of 2 cos30 each.

Wait, 3 +6*(√3/2) =3 +3√3. Which brings me back to the same denominator as before.

Thus, same result of d≈3.49. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that I'm miscalculating and that the denominator is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) + 2*(hk + hl + kl)*(cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)/3 ). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

But for (111): denominator=3 + 3*(2 * 1 *1 * cos30 )=3 + 6*(√3/2 )=3 +3√3.

Same as before.

I'm stuck. I think the only possibility is that the correct answer is approximately 3.49, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question refers to the interplanar distance in a different way. For example, perhaps it's not (111) in the unit cell, but in a projected structure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition of the rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else, like the distance between more distant atoms. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) } }

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Hmm. Since all options are around 9 Angstrom, perhaps I should think that a is different. If d=9, then a= d * sqrt(3 +3√3 )=9*2.863≈25.77. Which doesn't fit with the given a=10.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm meant to calculate the reciprocal of the denominator without 'a' involved. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using a different sign in the denominator. Let's imagine it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

So for (111), denominator=3 -6*(√3/2 )=3-3√3≈3-5.196≈-2.196. Which is negative. Impossible. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) ) 

But that would give denominator=3-6= -3. Again, impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach, like using vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length 'a', with angles between them of 30 degrees.

The (111) plane is defined by the plane equation x + y + z = 1.

The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes, which can be found by the formula:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } } * (a) 

Wait, but that's the same formula as before.

So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by a. But that's what I did before.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but the distance between two (111) planes, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different crystal system, like hexagonal. But the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps I should note that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is given as a / sqrt(3 + 3√3 ), which is about 3.49, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different system. Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a hexagonal system, but no, the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not all 30 degrees. But the question states alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I have and see which option is closest, but none match.

Wait, perhaps the question is miswritten. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, 9.54 Angstrom. Let me compute 9.54 * sqrt(3 +3√3 )=9.54 *2.863≈27.33. So a would be 27.33 Angstrom, which is way bigger than the given a=10.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator was meant to be (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + ... ), but that leads to a negative denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula where the denominator is (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 ) * something else.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance in a cubic system is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). In this case, (111) gives a/√3 ≈5.77. But the options are higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt(3 +3√3 )=10*2.863≈28.63. But that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angles. The angles are in degrees, so cos30 is √3/2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is A)9.08 or B)8.95.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator again:

sqrt(3 +3√3 )=sqrt(3(1 +√3 ))=sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 +√3 )≈1.732 * 1.931≈3.346.

So 10 /3.346 ≈2.99 Angstrom.

Hmm, but that's even further off.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula is  a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) ), ignoring the cos terms.

So for (111), denominator is 3 +6=9. So d=10/3=3.33, which again doesn't match options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(60) ), since 30 degrees might have been a typo.

Wait, if it were 60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

Denominator: 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

d=10/sqrt(6)=10/2.449≈4.08, which is still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, but none of them lead to any of the provided options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the length of the diagonal, not the edge length. For example, in a cubic system, the face diagonal is a√2, and the space diagonal is a√3. But the problem says interatomic distance, which is along the edge. So a=10.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using a different convention for the lattice parameters, such as a, b, c being different but equal in a rhombohedral system. No, in rhombohedral, a=b=c.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is different. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator again accurately.

Compute 3 +3√3.

√3≈1.73205.

3√3≈5.19615.

So 3 +5.19615=8.19615.

sqrt(8.19615)=2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.491.

So again, this leads to d≈3.49.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, perhaps option B is closest to 3.49. But no, the options are all much higher.

Wait, perhaps the question swapped a with another parameter. For example, if a is 10, but the formula uses a different term.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a/(h² +k² +l²)^(1/2) without considering angles. So for (111), d=10 / sqrt(3)≈5.77. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) )).

No, denominator would be 3 -6= -3. Impossible.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since the options are not matching, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator.

Wait, let's calculate 3 +3√3 more accurately.

3√3 =3 *1.7320508075688772=5.196152422706632.

So 3 +5.196152422706632=8.196152422706632.

sqrt(8.196152422706632)=2.862529974 approx.

So 10 /2.862529974=approx 3.490.

So about 3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps the intended approach was different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the interplanar distance in reciprocal space in a different way.

Wait, another approach: The reciprocal lattice vectors for (111) are:

G = 1*a^* +1*b^* +1*c^*

The magnitude of G is |G|= sqrt( (1/a)^2 (1^2 +1^2 +1^2 + 2*1*1*(cos gamma + cos beta + cos alpha) ) )

Wait, perhaps the magnitude of G is 1/d. So:

|G|= (1/a) * sqrt(3 + 2*(cos gamma + cos beta + cos alpha) )

Wait, but for rhombohedral, perhaps the reciprocal vectors are:

b1 = 1/a (1,1,1)

b2 = 1/a (1, -1, -1)

b3 = 1/a (-1,1,-1)

So the (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal vector G = h b1 +k b2 + l b3.

For (111), G= b1 +b2 +b3 = [1,1,1] (1/a) + [1,-1,-1] (1/a ) + [-1,1,-1] (1/a )

Adding these components:

x-component: 1 +1 -1 =1

y-component:1 -1 +1=1

z-component:1 -1 -1= -1

So G = (1,1,-1)/a.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute G correctly.

Wait, no, for G = h b1 + k b2 + l b3.

So for h=1, k=1, l=1:

G =1*(1,1,1)/a +1*(1,-1,-1)/a +1*(-1,1,-1)/a.

So adding:

x:1 +1 -1=1

y:1 -1 +1=1

z:1 -1 -1= -1.

So G=(1,1,-1)/a.

The magnitude of G is |G|= sqrt( (1/a)^2 (1^2 +1^2 + (-1)^2 )) = sqrt(3)/a.

So |G|= sqrt(3)/a.

Since |G|=1/d, d= a / sqrt(3).

So d=10 / sqrt(3)≈5.7735 Angstrom.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Wait, but this is the same as the cubic case because the reciprocal vector came out as (1,1,-1). So perhaps the formula in this case doesn't account for the angles, but that's incorrect.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the approaches I've tried, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the possible miscalculations, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 8.95 Angstrom.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A)9.08.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 10 divided by 0.99, which is approximately 10.10, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) )

Which for (111):

Denominator=3 -6=-3. Not possible.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to accept that I can't find a match with the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the angles in the formula are 180-30=150 degrees, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are measured differently. For example, sometimes the angle between two vectors is the supplement. But that would mean using cos(150)= -√3/2, which would make the denominator much larger.

Let me try that.

cos(150)= -√3/2.

Denominator=3 + 6*(-√3/2 )=3 -3√3 ≈3-5.196≈-2.196. Again, negative, impossible.

So that can't be right.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I need to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) * 2 * cos(alpha) )

Which for (111): 3 + 3*(2*1*1*cos30 )=3 +3*(√3 )=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)= 10/2.863≈3.49.

No, same result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) ) * cos(alpha).

So for (111):

Denominator=3 + 6 cos30.

Which is 3 + 6*(√3/2 )=3+3√3=8.196.

Again same result.

So I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The only conclusion is that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 / (sqrt(3 +3√3 )) and see if it's approximately 3.49 and check the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54. Let me compute 9.54 * sqrt(3 +3√3 )=9.54 *2.863≈27.33. So a would have to be 27.33 Angstrom, which contradicts the given a=10. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different lattice parameter. For instance, if the given interatomic distance is along the diagonal, but that's not the case here.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95, but I can't see how. I'm probably missing something.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

Here, the crystal has \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) (interatomic distance), and the angles are \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \). For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \). Substituting these values:

1. **Denominator Calculation**:  
   The denominator becomes:  
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = k = l = 1 \) and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):  
   \[
   1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   3 + 3\sqrt{3}
   \]  
   Numerically:  
   \[
   3 + 3\sqrt{3} \approx 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

2. **Interplanar Distance**:  
   Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all significantly larger (8.95 Å, 9.08 Å, etc.). This suggests either a mismatch in assumptions or a potential issue with the problem setup.

4. **Reevaluation of Assumptions**:  
   The problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Å, which is assumed to correspond to the lattice parameter \( a \). However, if the interatomic distance refers to a different metric (e.g., diagonal distances), \( a \) might need adjustment. Despite extensive recalculations and exploring alternative approaches, the result remains consistent at \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \).

Given the mismatch between the calculated result and the options, and without further clarification, the closest plausible answer based on the problem's intent is **B) 8.95 Å**, though this does not align with the derived calculations.

Answer: B
