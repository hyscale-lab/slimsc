Okay, so I have this complicated question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? So the vector has the ligand and the receptor. 

The ligand is ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' position and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the ligand comes first, then the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. IRES usually allows for internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor can be translated even if the ligand's translation is terminated.

There are stop cassettes in between. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between it and mCherry. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP. So normally, without Cre, the mCherry and eGFP would be under these stop signals, meaning they might not be expressed unless the stop is removed. 

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct, so I think the ligand and receptor are co-expressed. The CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES allows for the receptor's translation. So without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place, so mCherry and eGFP shouldn't be expressed. But the researcher used Cre. Oh wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector, so when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed.

So when Cre is introduced, it recombines the loxP sites, removing the stop for mCherry, and similarly for the lox2272 sites. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

The researcher transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They saw signals proportional to actin loading, suggesting the proteins are expressed. So the vector works in culture.

Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development and some glial cells, like astrocytes. Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, I suppose, so it's active in neural crest-derived cells, which includes astrocytes.

After the mice are born, they use a confocal microscope to look for fluorescence. They expected eGFP to be expressed, but saw no green signal. What's the issue?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if both are expressed in the same cell, they might still function. Not sure how this would prevent eGFP expression. The issue here is about expression, not function. So probably not A.

B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That could prevent it from being on the cell surface, so no GFP signal. But why would it be stuck? The vector seems to have the correct setup. Also, since the researchers saw expression in the Western blot, the eGFP is being made. If it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe they wouldn't see it in the Western? Or maybe it's being retained. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed but not properly localized. But if the construct has a stop cassette before eGFP, and Cre removes it, then the receptor and eGFP should be expressed. So perhaps this is a possibility, but I'm not sure.

C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter that doesn't require enhancers. The receptor is under IRES, which is part of the bicistronic setup. So if the enhancer was missing, maybe the expression wouldn't happen, but in the Western blot, proteins were expressed. So probably not C.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop cassette isn't correctly removed, the receptor and eGFP might not be expressed. Wait, but the stop is flanked by lox2272. Cre would remove the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed in frame. If they're not in frame, the fusion protein might not be made correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the construct was incorrectly designed. For example, if the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation or the multiple cloning sites aren't correctly arranged, the stop might not be removed. Or perhaps the eGFP is in a different reading frame than the receptor, causing a frameshift.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by the eGFP, but with a stop cassette in between. So when Cre is active, the lox2272 sites are recombined, removing the stop, so the receptor and eGFP are expressed together, in frame. If the frames don't match, the eGFP might not be expressed or the protein might be truncated.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is under a different promoter, but no, the IRES would drive its expression.

Wait, the vector is ligand (CBA-driven), then IRES, then receptor, then lox2272 stop lox2272, then eGFP. So when Cre is active, the stop is removed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed as a single transcript? Or wait, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So the vector is ligand (with stop) and receptor (with stop before eGFP). So Cre removes the stop for ligand and mCherry, and the stop for receptor and eGFP.

So after Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is expressed with eGFP. So in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre should activate Cre in the neural crest cells, including where the receptors are supposed to be expressed.

So why no eGFP signal? One possibility is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Maybe the stop wasn't properly removed. But in the initial experiment in culture, they saw the proteins were expressed. So perhaps the mouse model isn't expressing it.

Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is in the genome. So if the mice are homozygous for the construct, both alleles have the same setup. The Cre is from the SOX10-Cre line; SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so Cre should be active there.

Wait, but maybe the issue is that Cre wasn't properly active in the construct. Or perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are incompatible. Oh wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites. lox2272 is a variant, but Cre can still cut them. But perhaps in the vector, the lox sites are arranged in a way that when Cre acts, it doesn't delete the stop. Or perhaps the Cre isn't present in the right cells.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the same setup. The Cre is from the SOX10-Cre mice; they're crossed to the homozygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and Cre. So in the neural crest cells, Cre would be active, leading to the deletion of the stops.

If the stops were correctly removed, then the receptor-eGFP should be expressed. But if not, no eGFP.

Another possibility is that the expression cassettes are in the wrong order. Let me think: the vector is ligand (CBA promoter), then IRES, then receptor, and then eGFP after the lox2272 stop. So when Cre removes lox2272, the receptor and eGFP are in the same reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the wrong frame. If the lox2272 is placed such that when the stop is removed, the eGFP is reading frame compatible. But perhaps the design was wrong, causing a frameshift.

So if the eGFP is not in frame, the fusion protein would not be made correctly, leading to no eGFP expression. So when they do the Western blot, perhaps the antibody wouldn't detect, but the user said the blot showed signals proportional to actin. Wait, but the question says that when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, the antibodies detected the overexpressed proteins. So in the transient transfection, the constructs were correctly expressed. But in the mouse, perhaps they aren't.

Wait, but why would the plasmid in culture work but the transgenic mouse not? Maybe because in the mouse, the construct is in a different genomic context. Or perhaps the expression elements (like the IRES for the receptor) are not working in the mouse. Alternatively, perhaps the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the right cells.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct in the wt background. They are crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is active in neural crest-derived cells, which includes some astrocytes.

So the eGFP should be expressed in those cells. But in the offspring, they don't see green. So why?

Another possibility is that the vector isn't being expressed. Because the mouse's own regulatory elements are not present. The construct has the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. But perhaps in the mouse, the IRES isn't working, or the CBA isn't strong enough.

Wait, in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so it should drive expression. The receptor is under IRES, which should allow for its expression even if the ligand's translation is terminated.

But if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the IRES isn't working. Alternatively, perhaps the vector's expression cassettes are in the wrong orientation.

Alternatively, maybe the mouse's Cre isn't active, but the question says the mice were crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should be active in the relevant cells.

Wait, maybe the lox sites are not correctly positioned. The ligand has loxP-stop, and the receptor has lox2272-stop. Cre can recognize both, but perhaps the recombination doesn't happen correctly.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different. Lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but has a different sequence. So when Cre is introduced, it should recombine the lox sites. But if the lox sites are in the same orientation, they can be recombined. But if the lox sites are in opposite orientations, the recombination might not delete the stop.

Wait, the lox sites in the vector: for the ligand, it's loxP-stop-loxP. So the two loxP sites flank the stop. Similarly, the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it should recombine these sites, removing the stop.

But if the lox sites are on the same chromosome in a way that the stops are not correctly removed, the eGFP might not be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the orientation is wrong. For loxP and lox2272, if they are in the same orientation, recombination deletes the intervening sequence. If they are in opposite orientation, it inverts. But the stops are within the same construct, so for each cassettes, the lox sites are in the same orientation.

But perhaps the vector uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. So when Cre is introduced, the stop in the ligand is removed, leading to ligand-mCherry expression. Similarly, the lox2272 sites are recombined, removing the stop between receptor and eGFP, so receptor-eGFP is expressed.

But in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't active, but the question says that the mice were crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should have active Cre in the relevant cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the mouse's Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present. Maybe the construct is expressed in a different cell type.

Wait, if the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship (option A), that means they're secreted and act on nearby cells. So the eGFP would be on the surface of the neighboring cells, not the ones producing the ligand. But in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells, including the cells where the construct is present. So if the receptor (eGFP) is expressed in the same cell as the ligand, then you'd expect eGFP to be present in those cells.

If the ligand is secreted (like a growth factor), then the eGFP (on the cell surface of the same cell) would be present. So why no eGFP signal in the confocal?

Another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being properly translated. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be expressed. But in the transient transfection, the Western blot showed the proteins were expressed, so perhaps the issue is that in the mouse, for some reason, the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but in the initial experiment, the researcher used the same construct in astrocyte culture and saw expression. So the vector works. So why not in the mouse?

Hmm. If the Western blot after transfection showed expression, but the mouse doesn't show it, perhaps the construct isn't being properly expressed in the mouse. Maybe the CBA promoter isn't working in the mouse, but that's unlikely because it's a strong promoter.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, with the ligand under CBA, the receptor under IRES. So the ligand is driven by CBA, which should be strong, and the receptor is driven by the IRES, which is after the ligand's stop. So after Cre recombination, the stops are removed, so both are expressed.

But in the mouse, perhaps the construct is not undergoing recombination. Or perhaps the Cre isn't active in the right cells.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct. When they are crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in SOX10-expressing cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active in the neural crest-derived cells, which would delete the stop cassettes.

Wait, but the construct is in the mouse's genome. So in the absence of Cre, the stops aren't removed. So without Cre, the ligand and receptor shouldn't be expressed. But when the Cre is introduced, the stops are removed, allowing expression.

So in the mouse, the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre line. So the Cre should be active in the relevant cells, leading to the removal of the stops, and expression of the proteins.

But the confocal shows no eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed. Why?

Let me go back to the options.

Looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would prevent proper eGFP expression. If the stop is correctly removed, but the eGFP is out of frame, the resulting protein would be truncated or not made, so eGFP wouldn't fluoresce.

But in the transient transfection, the proteins were expressed, so perhaps the plasmid was correctly designed. But the transgenic line could have issues. Maybe in the mouse, the eGFP is not in frame, so it's not expressed.

Wait, but the vector should have been designed correctly. So why would the mouse model have a problem but the plasmid didn't?

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is after the receptor, but in the mouse, the construct is in a different location, causing it to be out of frame. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that the IRES is not working. The IRES is between the ligand and the receptor. But in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then, why would the Western blot in the initial experiment show the receptor? Because in the transient transfection, the IRES would have worked.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is with the expression of eGFP. It's at the C-terminus of the receptor. If the stop cassette wasn't removed correctly, eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, let me think about the vector structure again. The ligand is first, then IRES, then receptor, then stop, then eGFP. So the vector is:

Ligand (CBA promoter) --> IRES --> Receptor (stop cassette: lox2272 stop lox2272) --> eGFP.

So, when Cre is present, the stop cassette is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together. So the mRNA is ligand, then IRES, then receptor and eGFP.

Wait, no, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's coding sequence continues into eGFP. So the protein would be receptor-eGFP fusion.

But if the stop is not removed, then the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. But the Western blot showed that the overexpressed proteins were present, so in the transient expression, the stops were removed.

But in the mouse, perhaps the stops were not removed. So why?

Wait, maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present. But the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells.

Wait, perhaps the Cre isn't active because the construct is homozygous. No, Cre is active in the cells where SOX10 is expressed, regardless of genotype.

Another possibility is that the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. Suppose the lox2272 sites are in the reverse orientation. Then, Cre would recombine them, but perhaps insert the stop again or not delete it. Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are arranged such that the stop remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a single lox2272 site before the stop and another after. If they are in the same orientation, Cre would delete the stop. If in opposite, it would invert. But if inverted, maybe the stop remains.

Wait, the construct has lox2272-stop-lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it would recombine these two sites, deleting the stop. So that's correct.

If the lox sites are in the correct orientation, the stop is removed. If not, the stop remains.

But in the vector design, the lox sites should be in the same orientation.

So, if in the vector, the lox sites are in the same orientation, Cre would delete the stop.

But if in the vector, the lox sites are in opposite orientations, Cre would invert the region, but the stop would remain.

Wait, but in the question, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So the lox sites are correctly placed for recombination.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let's go through the options again.

Option D is about the receptor and eGFP not being in frame. If the stop is correctly removed, but the eGFP is in a different frame, it won't be expressed. But in the Western blot, the proteins were expressed—so maybe the frame is correct.

But maybe during cloning, the eGFP was inserted in a different frame, so when expressed, the eGFP isn't present. But the Western blot detected the overexpressed proteins. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP isn't being translated because the reading frame is wrong. So the antibody against eGFP wouldn't detect it, but the antibody against the receptor would. But in the question, the Western blot showed a signal proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. So perhaps the eGFP is present but not fluorescent.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is expressed but not functional. For example, if the frame is correct, but there's a premature stop codon in eGFP, making it non-fluorescent. But in the Western, the antibody would detect the full-length receptor-eGFP fusion.

Wait, the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent, the Western would show the band. So the confocal not showing green may be because the eGFP isn't fluorescent, but the Western shows the protein is expressed.

So why wouldn't the eGFP fluoresce? Maybe because it's not being properly folded. Or the cells are fixed in a way that the eGFP isn't permeable.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed, but the Western blot detects the receptor, which is present. But the question says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin, which implies all proteins are expressed.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So the Western blot would detect the receptor protein, but not eGFP unless the antibody targets eGFP.

Wait, the question says the researcher raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they probably made antibodies against both the ligand and the receptor, each fused with mCherry and eGFP. Or perhaps against the tags, like mCherry and eGFP. So if the Western blot uses an antibody against eGFP, it would detect it. 

But if the eGFP is not expressed, then it wouldn't show up. But the question says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin, so perhaps all proteins are expressed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not properly localized. For example, if the receptor is retained in the ER or Golgi, eGFP wouldn't reach the cell surface, so the confocal wouldn't see it. But in the Western blot, the protein would still be present.

In the question, the construct is designed so that the receptor is a transmembrane protein. So the eGFP would be on the cell surface, but if the receptor is mislocalized, the eGFP wouldn't be seen.

So, option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If that's the case, the Western would detect the protein, but the confocal wouldn't see it fluorescing because it's not on the surface. So that could explain the result.

So between options B and D.

Option D suggests the eGFP is not in frame, but the Western blot showed expression, so probably not.

Option B suggests the protein is stuck in the Golgi, so it's expressed but not at the cell surface. So the confocal wouldn't see it.

But why would it be stuck in the Golgi? Maybe due to incorrect signal peptides or processing. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is causing misfolding, leading to retention.

Wait, the receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it should be properly trafficked. The eGFP is at the C-terminus. If the eGFP tag is causing the protein to misfold, it might be retained in the ER/Golgi.

But why would this happen only in the mouse and not in the transfected cells? Maybe in the transient transfection, the cells can handle it, but in the transgenic mouse, perhaps overexpression causes issues. But the question says the Western blot in the mouse wasn't done; the blot was after transfection in culture.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the IRES isn't working. But in the initial experiment, the IRES worked because the proteins were expressed.

Wait, another angle: the IRES in the vector is between the ligand and the receptor. So the ligand is under CBA, then the IRES drives the receptor. So when Cre is present, the stop between receptor and eGFP is removed, so eGFP is expressed.

But if the IRES isn't working in the mouse, the receptor might not be expressed, but the ligand is. But then, the Western blot in the mouse would show the ligand but not the receptor. But the question says that in the mouse, they don't see eGFP, implying the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, no, the Western blot after transfection showed expression, not the mouse. The mouse's expression was checked by confocal.

Wait, the question says that after the mouse is born, they visualize them under confocal. So they're looking for eGFP. If the eGFP isn't expressed, they don't see it.

So, the construct's eGFP isn't being expressed.

Which brings me back to the possibility that the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation, so the stop isn't removed. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But if the vector was correctly designed, that wouldn't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift, so the eGFP isn't expressed as a separate protein. But the Western blot would show the receptor without eGFP.

But the question says that the blot showed a signal proportional to actin, which would imply that the proteins are expressed.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the most likely answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because that would prevent the eGFP from being correctly expressed, leading to no fluorescence. But the Western blot would still show the receptor, as it's expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. If the eGFP isn't present, the antibody against eGFP wouldn't detect anything. But the question says the signal is proportional to actin, implying that all proteins are expressed. So perhaps the Western blot uses an antibody against the receptor, not eGFP.

Wait, the question says the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps they have an antibody against the receptor, which would show a band regardless of eGFP. So the blot would show the receptor, but the confocal wouldn't show eGFP, perhaps because the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why isn't eGFP expressed? If the stop wasn't removed.

Which brings me back to the possibility that the lox2272 sites are not correctly recombined. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present.

Wait, SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which includes some glial cells, including astrocytes. So if the construct is in those cells, Cre should be active, leading to the removal of the stops.

But perhaps the construct isn't present in the right cells. Or perhaps the construct isn't being properly expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is a single transcript for both ligand and receptor, but without Cre, the stop is in place. So without Cre, no expression. But with Cre, the stops are removed, allowing expression.

But in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't active, so the stops remain, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should be active in the relevant cells.

Hmm.

I'm going to make a educated guess here. The most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when Cre removes the stop, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly, leading to no fluorescence. But the Western blot detects the receptor, which is present.

So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with mCherry fused to the ligand and eGFP fused to the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP for the ligand and lox2272-stop-lox2272 for the receptor) are present, which Cre can remove to allow expression. The construct was transfected into primary astrocytes, where Western blot confirmed protein expression. However, in a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, no green fluorescence from eGFP was observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on nearby cells, while the receptor remains in the same cell. However, the issue here is about the lack of eGFP expression, not the functional relationship between ligand and receptor. Since the Western blot confirmed protein expression, this is unlikely to explain the absence of fluorescence.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were mislocalized to the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, and fluorescence would not be observed. However, the Western blot showed protein expression, indicating proper synthesis. This could explain the lack of fluorescence but does not fully account for the construct's behavior in the mouse model compared to the transient transfection in culture.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong and constitutive, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Both were confirmed to be expressed in the transient transfection. Therefore, the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression in the mouse model.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This could result in the absence of fluorescence while still allowing the receptor to be detected in the Western blot. This explanation aligns with the observation that the Western blot showed protein expression but no fluorescence was observed in the confocal microscopy.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP and resulting in the absence of fluorescence. This aligns with the observed results in the mouse model and the confirmed protein expression in the Western blot.
