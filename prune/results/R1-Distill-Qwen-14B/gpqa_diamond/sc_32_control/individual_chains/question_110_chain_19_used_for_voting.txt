Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like exoplanet detection and stellar spectroscopy. The question gives me some details about each star and the capabilities of the two instruments.

Let me start by breaking down what I know. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is at the Paranal Observatory, and HIRES is at Keck. The key point here is their limiting magnitudes. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, meaning it can see stars that are V <=17. HIRES can observe brighter than V 16, so V <=16. So, a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 to be seen by HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Oh wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Oh right, because the magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. So, brighter stars have smaller (more negative) magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would be magnitude 16, 15, etc. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude up to 17, meaning they can see up to V=17. HIRES can observe up to V=16. So, any star that has an apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16 can be seen by both, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So for a star to be visible by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

Wait, let me think again. ESPRESSO can observe up to V=17. HIRES can observe up to V=16. So if a star's V is <=16, both can see it. If it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. So the stars that can be detected by both must have apparent V ≤16.

Now let's look at each star. The options are Star1 to Star5.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, located at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as its absolute magnitude. So V=15.5. That's below 16, so both instruments can see it. Because 15.5 <=16, so HIRES can observe.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. Oh wait, that's above 16. So for HIRES, which requires V <=16, this is too faint. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <=17. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5. Wait, but there's also E(B-V) = 0.6, which is reddening due to dust. The question says the total absorption in V is E(B-V)*3.1. So the extinction (which makes stars appear fainter) is 0.6 *3.1 = 1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64? Wait, no. Wait, when you have extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is brighter (more negative) or fainter? Wait, extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so their apparent magnitude increases. Because the formula for extinction is Av = E(B-V) * 3.1. So the observed magnitude is m = m0 + Av. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is m0, you add Av to get the observed m. So Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's after extinction? Or before? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and E(B-V) =0.6 mag. The note says the total absorption in V is E(B-V)*3.1. So the absorption (extinction) is 0.6 *3.1 =1.86 mag. So the observed V magnitude (what we'd measure) is m_observed = m_intrinsic + extinction. So if the star's actual (intrinsic) V is m0, then m_observed = m0 +1.86. But wait, the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is 15.5. Is that the observed (after extinction) or the intrinsic (before)? I think it's the observed because when you observe a star, you see the extinction. So the actual apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the intrinsic is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. Wait, no, it depends on how the question is phrased. The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's the observed (after extinction). So what's the intrinsic apparent magnitude (what it would be without extinction)? That's m0 = m_observed - Av. So m0 =15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. But wait, for the purpose of this question, when considering whether the star can be observed, the apparent magnitude is the observed one, right? Because that's what the instrument measures.

Wait, but the spectrographs' limiting magnitudes are based on the apparent V magnitude they can detect. If the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, then for HIRES, which goes up to 16, it's within range. So Star3's observed V is 15.5, so both can detect. But wait, the extinction has already been applied, so the 15.5 is the magnitude that the observatory would see. So yes, both can detect Star3.

Wait, but let me think again. The star's observed V is 15.5, so that's the value that matters. So 15.5 is below 16, so HIRES can see it. And ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so yes. So Star3 can be seen by both.

Wait, but Star3's note says E(B-V)=0.6, so m_observed = m_intrinsic + 3.1 * E(B-V). So if the star's intrinsic V is m0, then m_observed = m0 +1.86. But the given m_observed is 15.5, so m0 is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. Wait, that doesn't change the fact that the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is what matters for the instrument's detection. So yes, Star3's observed V is 15.5, which is within HIRES's limit.

Star4: Absolute V is 15.5, located at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc, so since it's at 10 pc, apparent V is 15.5. Same as Star1. So that's within both's detection. However, Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4. So Av=0.4*3.1=1.24. So the observed V is m_observed = intrinsic m + 1.24. Wait, but what's the intrinsic m? If the star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5. But with extinction, observed is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. Wait, wait! No, wait: The star's absolute magnitude is its apparent magnitude at 10 pc without extinction. So if the star is at 10 pc, and has E(B-V)=0.4, then its observed apparent magnitude would be 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74. So the observed V is 16.74. Which is beyond HIRES's limit (which is V<=16), so HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <=17. So Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify:

Star4's parameters: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5.

But there's extinction. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 + (0.4 *3.1) =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed V is 16.74. So for HIRES: maximum V is 16. So 16.74>16. So HIRES can't see it. Only ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <=17. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: Absolute V is 16.5, located at 5 pc. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So since it's at 5 pc, which is half the distance, the apparent magnitude would be brighter. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

So M =16.5, d=5.

m = 16.5 +5 * log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 * log10(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) ≈16.5 -1.505≈14.995 ≈15.0.

So apparent V magnitude is about 15.0. No extinction mentioned, so E(B-V)=0? The question doesn't say, so I think Star5 has no extinction. So observed V is 15.0.

So both HIRES and ESPRESSO can detect it, since 15.0 <=16 and <=17.

Wait, but let me double-check. The absolute magnitude is 16.5. At 5 pc, so m = M +5 log(d/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.301) ≈16.5 -1.505 =14.995. So yes, around 15.0. So both can see it.

Wait, but the options involve which stars can be detected by both. So which stars have apparent V <=16.

Now, let's go through each star.

Star1: V=15.5. Both can see. So yes.

Star2: V=16.5. HIRES limit is 16, so no. Only ESPRESSO.

Star3: V=15.5, but wait. Wait, Star3's given apparent V is 15.5, but there's extinction. So after extinction, what's the observed V? Wait, earlier I thought the given 15.5 is the observed, but I'm now a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, Star3 has apparent V of 15.5 mag and E(B-V)=0.6. The note says total absorption in V band is E(B-V)*3.1, so Av=1.86. So the apparent V would be the intrinsic (what it would be without extinction) plus Av.

Wait, no, wait: The apparent magnitude is the observed one. So if the star's intrinsic (without extinction) apparent V is m0, then the observed is m0 + Av.

But the question gives the apparent V as 15.5. So m_observed is 15.5. So m0 would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But for the purpose of detection, the observed V is what matters. So Star3's observed V is 15.5, which is <=16 (HIRES) and <=17 (ESPRESSO). So both can detect it. So Star3 can be seen by both.

Wait no, wait a minute. Because if the star is at a distance, its apparent magnitude is affected by distance and extinction. But in the problem, Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5, but that already includes the extinction, right? Because when you observe a star, you see the extinction. So the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude after extinction. So the instruments' detection limits are based on this observed magnitude. So Star3's observed V is 15.5, which is within both.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me maybe make a table.

Star | Apparent V | With Extinction? | Observed V | Detectable by both?

Star1: Apparent V=15.5 (no extinction mentioned) → 15.5 → yes.

Star2: Apparent V=16.5 → HIRES can't (needs <=16), but ESPRESSO can (<=17) → no.

Star3: Apparent V=15.5 mag (with E(B-V)=0.6). Wait, but the given apparent V is 15.5, but the star is at 15 pc. Let me calculate its apparent V without extinction and then add extinction.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude and then add extinction to get the observed V.

Wait, Star3: Absolute V=15.5, distance=15 pc.

Intrinsic (without extinction) apparent V = M +5 log(d/10) =15.5 +5 log(15/10) =15.5 +5*(0.1761) ≈15.5 +0.8805≈16.38.

Then, extinction is Av= E(B-V)*3.1=0.6 *3.1=1.86.

So the observed V is 16.38 +1.86=18.24.

Wait, so the observed V is 18.24, which is way beyond both spectrographs' limits. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, that's a different approach and contradicts my earlier conclusion. So which is right?

I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The key is, when a star's apparent V is given without considering extinction, perhaps, or when extinction is applied.

Wait, the problem says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. So that implies that the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. Because if you have extinction, the observed magnitude is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic.

Wait, no, no. The apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes extinction. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0, then m_observed = m0 + Av.

So if the observed V is 15.5, then m0 =15.5 - Av =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude. Then, the star's actual distance would affect the apparent magnitude. Wait, but Star3 is at 15 pc. So wait, how do we compute the apparent magnitude including extinction?

Let me think again. The absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc without extinction. So M=15.5.

At 15 pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction would be M +5 log(15/10) =15.5 + 5 * 0.1761 ≈15.5 +0.88 ≈16.38.

Then, extinction adds 1.86, so observed V is 16.38 +1.86=18.24.

So Star3's observed V is 18.24, which is way beyond both ESPRESSO (<=17) and HIRES (<=16). So neither can detect it. So earlier conclusion was wrong; Star3 can't be seen by either.

Wait, but the problem says Star3's apparent V is 15.5. So that's the observed V, including extinction. That would mean that the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, with extinction already applied. So without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be lower (brighter). So that can't be, because the star is at 15 pc.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify:

The star's absolute magnitude (M) is 15.5. That's what it would appear as at 10 pc, without any extinction.

The star is at 15 pc, so without extinction, its apparent magnitude (m) would be m = M +5 log10(d/10) → 15.5 +5*(log10(15/10)) =15.5 +5*(0.1761)≈16.38.

Now, considering extinction (Av=1.86), the observed m becomes 16.38 +1.86=18.24.

Therefore, the observed V is 18.24, which is beyond both instruments' limits.

But the problem states that Star3's apparent V is 15.5. So perhaps the given 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without extinction. That would be confusing, but perhaps the question intended that.

Wait, but the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is..." So perhaps the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without considering extinction. Then, the observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So 17.36 is beyond HIRES's limit (16) but within ESPRESSO's (17). So Star3 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

But this is getting complicated. It's unclear whether the given apparent magnitude in Star3 includes extinction or not. The way the problem is written seems to imply that the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, because it also mentions E(B-V) and the absorption. So I think the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude, which includes extinction. Therefore, the m_observed is 15.5. Then the question is, can both spectrographs see it.

Wait, but if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, then both can see it, as 15.5 <=16 (HIRES) and 15.5 <=17 (ESPRESSO). But earlier calculation when considering the distance and extinction leads to a different conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me recompute each star:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc → m=15.5 (no extinction, as none is mentioned). Observed V=15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → ESPRESSO can, HIRES cannot.

Star3: m=15.5 (observed), so both can detect. But wait, wait, the star is at 15 pc, which is farther than 10 pc, so without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be brighter than M. But Star3's given m is 15.5, which is the same as M for a star at 10 pc. That seems conflicting. Unless the star's absolute magnitude is adjusted, but perhaps I shouldn't overcomplicate. Since the problem says the apparent V is 15.5, including extinction, then both can detect it.

Wait, but the star's distance is 15 pc, which would make it appear fainter than when at 10 pc. So without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be m = M +5 log(15/10) =15.5 +5*(0.1761)=16.38. But the given m is 15.5, which is brighter. That can only happen if the star is closer, or if extinction is making it appear brighter. But extinction makes stars appear fainter, not brighter. So maybe the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction) at 15 pc. Then, considering extinction, the observed m is 16.38 + 1.86=18.24, which is beyond both.

But this is getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem expects that Star3's observed V is 15.5, so both can detect.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the given apparent magnitude includes any extinction. So Star3's observed V is 15.5, which is within both.

But earlier, I thought that Star3's observed V is 15.5, but when you factor in distance and extinction, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is already the observed one, so the calculations are straightforward.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed step by step for each star.

Let me list each star, compute their apparent V with extinction considered, and see if it's <=16.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, no extinction. So m=15.5. Observed V=15.5. Both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.

Star3: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → Av=1.86. So observed V = m + Av =15.5 +1.86=17.36. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, but the given m is 15.5. If that's the intrinsic (without extinction), then the observed is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. Which is beyond both. But that can't be because the star's observed V can't be brighter than when it's closer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the observed (including extinction), so the intrinsic m would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. Then, the actual m without extinction is 13.64, but that's at 15 pc. So the star's m is 13.64 at 15 pc, but without extinction, that's impossible because a star at 15 pc with M=15.5 would have m =15.5 +5 log(15/10)=16.38. So if the intrinsic m is 16.38, and the observed is 16.38 +1.86=18.24, which is way beyond both.

This is getting too complicated, and maybe the problem expects a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should treat each star's apparent magnitude as given (without considering extinction unless it's explicitly part of the calculation), but that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the extinction only affects the star's apparent magnitude if it's in the line of sight. So for each star, I need to calculate whether the observed apparent magnitude is <=16.

Let me try again for each star:

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m = M =15.5. No extinction mentioned. So observed V=15.5. Both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5. Observed V=16.5. HIRES can't (16.5>16). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 (observed, including extinction). So observed V=15.5. Both can detect.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4 → Av=1.24. So m_intrinsic (without extinction) is 15.5. Observed m=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So 16.74>16 → HIRES can't. Only ESPRESSO.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc. So m = M +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5-1.505=14.995 → ~15.0. Observed V=15.0 (no extinction mentioned). Both can detect.

So, the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but according to the options, the choices are combinations like A) Star4 and Star5. So let's see which stars are detectable by both.

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount:

Star1: V=15.5 → both can detect.

Star2: V=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: V=15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: V=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: V=15.0 → both can detect.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4's V=16.74, which is beyond HIRES, so no.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both. So yes.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's V would be 17.36, but that was under the assumption that the given V was the intrinsic. If the given V is the observed, then it's 15.5, which is acceptable.

Wait, but I think I've made a mistake in Star3. Let me re-express:

Star3's parameters: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → Av=1.86.

If the apparent V of 15.5 is the observed (with extinction), then the intrinsic is 15.5-1.86=13.64.

But that's at 15 pc. So the star's absolute magnitude is M=15.5, so the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) at 15 pc is M +5 log(15/10)=15.5 +0.88=16.38. So the observed (with extinction) is 16.38 +1.86=18.24. So the observed V is 18.24, which is beyond both instruments.

But the problem states that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which suggests that the extinction has already been accounted for, making the observed V=15.5. So perhaps the way the problem is set up, extinction isn't affecting the detection in this case. Alternatively, perhaps the extinction is to be applied to compute the observed V.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore extinction when calculating the apparent magnitude, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude already includes the extinction, so we don't need to adjust it.

In that case, Star3's observed V is 15.5, so both can detect.

So, according to this, stars 1, 3, and 5 can be detected by both.

Looking at the options, option B says Star3 and Star5, which both can.

So the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is the same as the absolute magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - No extinction is mentioned.  
   - Observed V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( 15.5 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( 16.5 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it, but ESPRESSO can.  
   - Only detectable by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band is \( A_V = E(B-V) \cdot 3.1 = 0.6 \cdot 3.1 = 1.86 \).  
   - The given apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) is interpreted as the observed magnitude (already includes extinction).  
   - Observed V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( 15.5 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is the same as the absolute magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - Extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_V = 0.4 \cdot 3.1 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - \( 16.74 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it, but ESPRESSO can.  
   - Only detectable by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5(-0.301) \approx 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]
   - No extinction is mentioned.  
   - Observed V magnitude: \( m = 15.0 \).  
   - \( 15.0 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, the correct combination is **Star3 and Star5**.

**Answer: B**
