Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The reaction is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν. The pion is initially at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

Wait, but wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny masses, right? I remember that in many cases, the neutrino's mass is considered negligible compared to the other particles involved. So maybe I can treat the neutrino as massless here. That might simplify things.

The given data includes the rest masses: the pion (π⁺) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon (μ⁺) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is probably negligible, so I'll consider its rest mass as zero.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should also be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but their directions are opposite. 

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, so the neutrino's momentum is -p. Because the neutrino's mass is zero, its energy comes solely from its momentum (E = |p|c). For the muon, its total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. 

So, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) and the neutrino's energy. 

Let me write down the conservation of energy equation:

m_π c² = (E_mu) + (E_nu)

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is γ m_mu c². But since the muon's rest mass is significant, γ must be greater than 1, but I'm not sure how much. Alternatively, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), and E_nu = p c. 

So substituting, we have:

m_π c² = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c

Let me divide both sides by c² to make it easier:

m_π = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) / c + p

Wait, wait, let's make it dimensionally correct. Let's consider units where c=1, so energies are in MeV, masses in MeV/c² multiplied by c² gives MeV. So, equations would be in units where c=1.

So the equation becomes:

m_π = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p

Let me rearrange this equation. Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) as sqrt_term.

So,

m_π = sqrt_term + p → sqrt_term = m_π - p

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_π - p)^2

Expanding the right side:

= m_π² - 2 m_π p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_π² - 2 m_π p

Rearranging to solve for p:

2 m_π p = m_π² - m_mu^2

So,

p = (m_π² - m_mu²) / (2 m_π)

Plugging in the numbers:

m_π = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV

So,

p = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)

Let me compute numerator first. 139.6 squared is 139.6 * 139.6. Let me calculate that:

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2 * 140 * 0.4 + 0.4²
= 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16

105.7^2 = let me compute 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV²

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's do the division.

279.2 * 29 ≈ 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher. So 279.2 *29 = 279.2 * (30 -1)=8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 8315.67 is a bit higher than 8096.8. So 29 + some.

Difference is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

How much more? 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So p≈29.783 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in calculation because 279.2 * 29.78 would be ... let me check:

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78. Hmm, 279.2 * 30 =8376, minus 279.2 *0.22. 0.22 *279.2=61.424. So 8376 -61.424=8314.576. Which is very close to the numerator 8315.67. So p≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but the neutrino's momentum is p, and its energy is p*c, but since we're in units where c=1, the neutrino's energy is just p ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, which is much larger than the muon's 105.7 MeV. So the muon can't carry all the momentum. Wait, but I think my calculation is correct so far.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Let me compute that:

p=29.78 MeV/c, m_mu=105.7 MeV/c². So,

E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78 squared: approx 886.8

105.7^2 is 11172.49. So E_mu squared is 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29. So E_mu is sqrt(12059.29) ≈109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, because m_mu is 105.7, so the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = 109.8 MeV. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.1 MeV for the muon's kinetic energy. Then the neutrino's energy is p*c which is 29.78 MeV. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, so 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That seems to match. So the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for p and E_mu.

Wait, earlier I found p ≈29.78 MeV/c. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, the numerator: 139.6^2 is 19488.16, 105.7^2 is 11172.49. So 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute this exactly.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (as before). 279.2 * 0.783 = ?

Compute 0.7 * 279.2 = 195.44

0.08 * 279.2 = 22.336

0.003 *279.2=0.8376

So 0.783 *279.2 = 195.44 +22.336=217.776 +0.8376=218.6136

So 279.2 * 29.783 = 8096.8 + 218.6136 = 8315.4136. Which is very close to 8315.67. So p=29.783 MeV/c.

So E_mu is sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.783)^2:

29.783 *29.783:

Let me compute 29 *29 = 841.

29 *0.783 = 22.707.

0.783 *29 =22.707.

0.783^2 ≈ 0.613.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 29.783 is approximately 30 -0.217.

So (30 -0.217)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2.

= 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 886.03.

So 29.783^2 ≈886.03.

105.7^2 =11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = 886.03 + 11172.49= 12058.52.

So sqrt(12058.52) is approximately 109.8 MeV.

So E_mu =109.8 MeV.

The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p=29.783 MeV. Since its rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy, so 29.783 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the earlier steps. For example, when I wrote the energy conservation equation.

The equation was:

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Wait, no, the units are with c=1, so the energies are in MeV, masses in MeV/c² multiplied by c², so yes, it's correct.

So the calculation seems correct. So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking back at the options, option D is exactly that. So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to have negligible rest mass. Conservation of energy and momentum must be applied.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_\pi c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_\mu\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_\nu\)):  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_\mu + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   |\vec{p}_\mu| = |\vec{p}_\nu| = p.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Neutrino:**  
   The neutrino's energy is purely kinetic (since its rest mass is negligible):  
   \[
   E_\nu = p.
   \]

4. **Energy of the Muon:**  
   The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} + K_\mu,
   \]  
   where \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) is the muon's rest mass.

### Solving for Momentum (\(p\)):
Substitute \(E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2}\) and \(E_\nu = p\) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
m_\pi c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} + p.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} = m_\pi c^2 - p.
\]  
Square both sides:  
\[
p^2 + m_\mu^2 = (m_\pi c^2 - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + m_\mu^2 = m_\pi^2 c^4 - 2 m_\pi c^2 p + p^2.
\]  
Cancel \(p^2\) and solve for \(p\):  
\[
2 m_\pi c^2 p = m_\pi^2 c^4 - m_\mu^2.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{m_\pi^2 c^4 - m_\mu^2}{2 m_\pi c^2}.
\]  
Substitute \(m_\pi = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):  
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]  
Compute:  
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon:
The muon's total energy is:  
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2}.
\]  
Substitute \(p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\) and \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):  
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_\mu = E_\mu - m_\mu c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino:
The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy (since its rest mass is negligible):  
\[
K_\nu = E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
