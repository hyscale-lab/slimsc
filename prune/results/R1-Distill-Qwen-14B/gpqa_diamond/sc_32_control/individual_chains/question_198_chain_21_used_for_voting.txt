Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait, what's the structure here? I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. Each β corresponds to a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands.

So, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} for n=1,2,3,4. The stability constants are for each step, I think. Oh wait, no, usually the overall stability constant is for the formation of the complex from the ions. Oh right, the stability constant β is for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands.

So, the complexes are:

Co^{2+} + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_1^{+} with β1=9.

Co(SCN)_1^{+} + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^{0} with β2=40.

Co(SCN)_2^{0} + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^{-} with β3=63.

Co(SCN)_3^{-} + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^{2-} with β4=16.

Wait, but sometimes stability constants are given as stepwise or overall. I think the β given here are the overall formation constants for each complex. So, β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. Or maybe they're stepwise, meaning each β is for adding one ligand. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the overall formation constants.

Wait, I think each β is the cumulative constant. So β1 is for Co(SCN)_1^{+}, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^{0}, etc. So the first complex has β1=9, the second β2=40 (so 9*40=360 for the two-step process?), but wait no, each β is for each complex. So the way to approach this is to consider all possible complexes and their formation.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes. I think the blue complexes are the ones with more SCN-, like maybe the tetra or tri complexes. But wait, wait, I think the blue color corresponds to the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, in the question, it's called the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands, right? So wait, that's the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but wait, maybe the blue one is the tetra? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem statement says: "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- groups. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But wait, I thought the tetra is usually the more stable and perhaps more intense in color. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. But for the purpose of solving this problem, perhaps the question is referring to the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 as the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, but sometimes in these problems, there's a specific complex they consider as the colored one, perhaps the one with the highest stability. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the major species.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue color is associated with the tetra complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Because I think that's a deep blue color. Hmm, but the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- groups. So perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the divalent. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the tetra complex as dithiocyanato? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, wait. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- groups, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But then, why is it called dithiocyanato? Oh, because it's two SCN- ligands attached as a dithiocyanate. No, wait, dithiocyanato might be a term I'm not familiar with. Alternatively, perhaps the term is used differently here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the blue color is from the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which is tetra. So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue (tetra) complexes. But the question specifically says "dithiocyanato," which implies two SCN- groups. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just proceed with the calculation and see where it leads me.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the distribution of the various complexes. The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex present and then see which one(s) are considered in the answer.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: [Co^2+], [Co(SCN)^+], [Co(SCN)_2^0], [Co(SCN)_3^-], [Co(SCN)_4^2-]. But perhaps the problem considers only the first four and the last one, but the given βs are up to β4=16.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the formation constant for each step, meaning that each subsequent β is for adding another SCN-.

Wait no, I think each β is for the overall complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So for example, the formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of the βs up to that point. No, wait, that's if βs are the stepwise constants. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify this.

Wait, let's clarify: The stability constant (β) for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is given by βn. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2−}.

So the β values are for each complex. So β1 = 9 for the first complex, β2 =40 for the second, etc.

Wait, but wait, the way stability constants work is that for each step, you have a stepwise formation constant. So the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^+; β1 = [Co(SCN)^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

The second step is Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0; β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([Co(SCN)^+][SCN^-]) =40.

Then β3 is for the third step, and so on. But the overall formation constant for the third complex would be β1 * β2 * β3. But the way the problem gives the constants is for each complex. So each βn is the stepwise constant for the nth step. So to get the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n], you would multiply all β from 1 to n.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Each βn is the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n. So for example, [Co(SCN)_1^+]: β1 = 9.

[Co(SCN)_2^0]: β2 =40.

Wait, but how? How does that work? Because the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2^0] would be β1 * β2. Because it's the product of the two stepwise constants. So perhaps the way to model it is to consider each step, and the overall β for the nth complex is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But wait, the problem gives four β values, so for each complex, the overall β is the product up to that point. So:

β1 =9 → [Co(SCN)]^+.

β1*β2 =9*40=360 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

β1*β2*β3=360 *63= 22680 → [Co(SCN)_3^-].

β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16= 362880 → [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

Wait, but the given β4 is 16. So if I'm correct, the overall β for each complex is the product up to that point.

But now, the problem says that the concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration. So the formation of complexes will be favored because ligand is in excess.

But the problem is to find the fraction of each Co species, so that the sum of all fractions equals 1 (or 100%).

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the given βs and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

But how do I compute the fractions?

The general approach for such problems is to use the formation constants to find the distribution of each species. The formula usually involves the fraction of each complex, considering the log of the β and the concentrations.

But perhaps a better approach is to model this using the stability constants and the concentrations.

The formula for the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, actually, each term in the denominator represents the contribution of each complex. So the denominator is the sum of the [Co^{2+}] plus [Co(SCN)^+] plus [Co(SCN)_2^0] plus [Co(SCN)_3^-] plus [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]. Alternatively, each term is the product of the βs up to that point multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, let me correct that. The fraction for each complex is (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / Sum_{k=0}^4 (β_k [SCN^-]^k ), where β_0 is defined as 1 (since [Co^2+] is the free ion).

Wait, no, β_0 is 1, β_1 is 9, etc. So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, no, that's correct if each βn is the stepwise constant. But in our earlier calculation, I think I'm mixing up whether the βn are overall or stepwise.

Wait, perhaps I should think of βn as the overall formation constant for the nth complex, which would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Because each β is the stepwise constant.

So, for example:

β1 (stepwise) =9 → [Co(SCN)]^+.

β1 * β2 (stepwise) =9 *40=360 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

β1 * β2 * β3 =9*40*63= 22680 → [Co(SCN)_3^-].

β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 22680 * 16=362880 → [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

So the overall β for each complex is:

β1=9,

β2=360,

β3=22680,

β4=362880.

Now, the fraction of each complex is given by (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum over k=0 to 4 of βk [SCN]^k ), where β0=1.

So in our case,

β0=1,

β1=9,

β2=360,

β3=22680,

β4=362880.

But wait, wait. The stepwise βs are given, but to get the overall β for each complex, I need to multiply the stepwise βs up to that point. So, βn = product of β1 up to βn. So for the first complex, β1=9, for the second, β2=9*40=360, third is 360*63=22680, and fourth is 22680*16=362880.

Now, the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the denominator is the sum of all species, each term being β_k [SCN]^k, where k is 0 to 4, and β_0=1.

So, [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term:

Term for k=0: β0 [SCN]^0 =1 *1=1.

k=1: β1 [SCN]^1=9 *0.1=0.9.

k=2: β2 [SCN]^2 =360 * (0.1)^2 =360 * 0.01=3.6.

k=3: β3 [SCN]^3=22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

k=4: β4 [SCN]^4=362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them up:

1 +0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction for each complex is (βn [SCN]^n ) / 64.468.

But wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is k=2. So f2 is (3.6) /64.468.

Wait, no. Because f2 is the fraction for the second complex, which has n=2, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So let me compute each fraction:

f0=1 /64.468 ≈0.0155.

f1=0.9 /64.468 ≈0.014.

f2=3.6 /64.468≈0.05556.

f3=22.68 /64.468≈0.3518.

f4=36.288 /64.468≈0.5628.

Wait, but wait, adding all these fractions:

0.0155 +0.014=0.0295.

+0.0556=0.0851.

+0.3518=0.4369.

+0.5628=0.9997, which is about 1. So that makes sense.

Wait, but according to this, the major species is the fourth complex, [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}], with fraction ≈56.28%, then the third complex is about 35%, and the second is about 5.5%, and the first is about 1.4%, and the free Co^2+ is about 1.55%.

But the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is the tetra, then the percentage is f4=56.28%. But that's not one of the options. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in which complex is which.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The blue complex in the problem is the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- groups. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the fraction is f2=3.6/64.468≈5.556%.

Wait, but that's only 5.5%, and the options given are in the 16-42% range. So that's conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's given are the stepwise βs, not the overall. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, earlier I assumed that βn is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. But perhaps the given βs are the individual stepwise constants. In that case, the overall β for the second complex would be β1*β2=9*40=360.

But wait, in that case, the denominator would be:

sum = β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but in that case, βn is the product up to that point, so each term is βn [SCN]^n.

So let me compute each term again with this approach.

β0=1.

β1=9.

β2= β1*β2=9 *40=360.

β3= β2 * β3=360 *63=22680.

β4= β3 * β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but that's what I did before. So in that case, the denominator is 1 +9*(0.1) +360*(0.1)^2 +22680*(0.1)^3 +362880*(0.1)^4.

Which is the same as before: 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.468.

Hmm. So the fractions are as before.

Wait, but then the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4), then the fraction is f4≈56%, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the second complex. Then, its fraction is about 5.5%, which isn't an option either.

Wait, looking at the options: A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, none of these match the 5.5% or 56% I calculated.

So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the βn are the stepwise constants, so β1=9, β2=40, etc., but not the overall. So the approach would be to compute each possible species with their respective stepwise βs.

Wait, but how do you compute the fraction of each species when the βs are stepwise?

Another approach is to model the formation step by step, considering all possible species.

The initial species is Co^2+.

When it binds SCN-, it forms [Co(SCN)]^+.

Each step forms the next complex, and the fractions can be calculated using the stepwise βs and the concentrations.

The general approach for each complex is:

For each possible n (0 to 4), the fraction f_n is:

f_n = ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) * (β1 β2 ... βn) ) / (sum over k=0 to 4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^k (β1 β2 ... βk) ) )

But [Co^2+] is present in a very low concentration (1e-2 M), but SCN^- is 0.1 M, which is high. Wait, no, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the sum of all species is equal to the total cobalt concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more accurately.

Let me set up the problem correctly.

Let’s denote:

Total Co concentration, C = 1e-2 M.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

The complexes are:

Co^2+ → X_0

Co(SCN)^+ → X_1

Co(SCN)_2^0 → X_2

Co(SCN)_3^- → X_3

Co(SCN)_4^{2-} → X_4.

Each X_i represents the concentration of the ith complex.

The formation constants (β) are:

β1 = 9 → X_1 = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-].

β2 =40 → X_2 = β2 [X_1][SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, X_3 = β3 [X_2][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3.

X_4 = β4 [X_3][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

So, each X_i can be written in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-], multiplied by the product of βs up to i.

The total concentration of all Co species is:

X_0 + X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 = C.

But X_0 is [Co^2+] = c.

So:

c + X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 = C.

But from the expressions above, X_i = (β1 β2 ... βi) c [SCN^-]^i.

So substituting:

c + (β1 c [SCN]^1) + (β1 β2 c [SCN]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 c [SCN]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 c [SCN]^4) ) = C.

We can factor out c:

c [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] = C.

So,

c = C / [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ].

Once we have c, we can compute each X_i, and then find the fraction of each X_i relative to the total.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue complex is X_4, then we need to find X_4 / C *100% .

So, let's compute each term.

Given:

β1=9,

β2=40,

β3=63,

β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1.

Compute each term in the denominator:

Term0=1.

Term1= β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2= β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3= β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4= β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4= 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001. So term4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the denominator D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = same as before: 64.468.

Therefore, c= C / D = (1e-2) /64.468 ≈1.551e-4 M.

Wait, but the total Co concentration is C=1e-2 M.

Now, compute each X_i.

X_0 = c ≈1.551e-4 M.

X_1= β1 c [SCN] =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1= 1.3959e-5.

Wait, no, wait: [SCN] is 0.1 M, but in the numerator, it's [SCN]^1, so X_1=9 * c * 0.1.

Wait, but c is 1.551e-4.

So X_1=9 *1.551e-4 *0.1= 9 * 1.551e-5=1.3959e-4 M.

X_2= β1 β2 c [SCN]^2=9*40 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^2.

9*40=360.

0.1^2=0.01.

So X_2=360 *1.551e-4 *0.01=360 *1.551e-6=5.5836e-4 M.

X_3=β1 β2 β3 c [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^3.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

(0.1)^3=1e-3=0.001.

So X_3=22680 *1.551e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.551e-7.

Calculating that: 22680 * 1.551e-7 = approx 3.515e-3 M.

X_4=β1 β2 β3 β4 c [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^4.

Compute step by step:

9*40=360.

360*63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=1e-4=0.0001.

So X_4=362880 *1.551e-4 *0.0001.

Wait, 1.551e-4 *0.0001=1.551e-8.

So X_4=362880 *1.551e-8.

Calculating that: 362880 *1.551e-8 ≈5.628e-3 M.

Wait, let me double-check that:

362880 * 1.551e-8 = ?

362880 is 3.6288e5.

3.6288e5 * 1.551e-8 = 3.6288 *1.551 * 1e-3.

3.6288 *1.551 ≈5.628.

So 5.628e-3 M, which is 0.005628 M.

Now, let's check the sum of all X_i to see if it equals C=1e-2 M (0.01 M).

Compute X_0 + X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4.

X_0=1.551e-4 ≈0.0001551.

X_1=1.3959e-4 ≈0.0001396.

X_2=5.5836e-4 ≈0.0005584.

X_3=3.515e-3 ≈0.003515.

X_4=5.628e-3 ≈0.005628.

Adding them up:

0.0001551 +0.0001396 =0.0002947.

+0.0005584 →0.0008531.

+0.003515 →0.0043681.

+0.005628 →0.010 (approx 0.01).

So it adds up correctly.

Now, the fractions are:

f0 = X_0 / C = (1.551e-4)/0.01 =0.01551 →1.551%.

f1= X_1 / C= 1.3959e-4 /0.01=0.01396 →1.396%.

f2=5.5836e-4 /0.01=0.05584 →5.584%.

f3=3.515e-3 /0.01=0.3515 →35.15%.

f4=5.628e-3 /0.01=0.5628 →56.28%.

Wait, this aligns with my earlier calculation. So the major species is the tetra complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, with 56.28% of the total Co.

But the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue is the tetra complex, then the answer would be 56.28%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue dithiocyanato.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is f2=5.584% (option D is 16.9%, which is not close).

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the third complex, [Co(SCN)_3^-], which is 35.15%. That's option C (38.1%) is close to 35%, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is given as the stepwise constant, but perhaps the overall β for the first complex is β1=9, the second is β2=40, etc., but not considering the product up to that point. So perhaps the overall β for each complex is just their individual βn, and the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, that would change the denominator.

Wait, let me try that approach.

In this case, the denominator would be:

sum = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1.

So:

Term0=1.

Term1=9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2=40 * (0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Term3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term4=16 * (0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum=1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator D=2.3646.

So c= C/D =1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

Now, compute each X_i.

X_0 = c ≈4.226e-3.

X_1= β1 c [SCN] =9 *4.226e-3 *0.1= 9 *4.226e-4=3.8034e-3.

X_2=β2 c [SCN]^2=40 *4.226e-3 * (0.1)^2=40 *4.226e-3 *0.01= 40 *4.226e-5=1.6904e-3.

X_3=β3 c [SCN]^3=63 *4.226e-3 *0.1^3=63 *4.226e-3 *0.001=63 *4.226e-6=2.66338e-4.

X_4=β4 c [SCN]^4=16 *4.226e-3 *0.1^4=16 *4.226e-3 *0.0001=16 *4.226e-7=6.7616e-6.

Now, sum all X_i:

X_0=4.226e-3=0.004226.

X1=3.8034e-3=0.0038034.

X2=1.6904e-3=0.0016904.

X3=2.66338e-4=0.0002663.

X4=6.7616e-6=0.00000676.

Total sum: 0.004226 +0.0038034=0.0080294.

+0.0016904=0.0097198.

+0.0002663=0.0099861.

+0.00000676=0.00999286 ≈0.01 M, which matches C=1e-2.

Now compute fractions:

f0= X0/C=4.226e-3 /0.01=0.4226 →42.26%.

f1= X1/C=3.8034e-3 /0.01=0.38034 →38.03%.

f2= X2/C=1.6904e-3 /0.01=0.16904 →16.904%.

f3= X3/C=2.66338e-4 /0.01=0.02663 →2.66%.

f4= X4/C=6.7616e-6 /0.01=0.000676 →0.0676%.

So the percentages are:

X0:42.26%,

X1:38.03%,

X2:16.904%,

X3:2.66%,

X4:0.0676%.

Hmm, this gives X2 as 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue is X2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the blue is X4, then in this approach, X4 is only 0.0676%, which is not an option.

But in the earlier approach, where βn were the overall constants, the X4 was 56%, which is not an option.

So the confusion arises from whether the given βs are stepwise or overall.

The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. It doesn't specify whether they're stepwise or overall. But in the absence of further information, I think that in such problems, the βs are usually given as the overall formation constants for each complex.

Wait, no. Wait, in most cases, stability constants are given as the overall constants for each complex, meaning that for [Co(SCN)_n], βn is the product of the stepwise βs up to the nth step. So in that case, the denominator would be 64.468, as in the first approach.

But that leaves us with the tetra complex (X4) at 56.28%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm still misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and the blue color is associated with [Co(SCN)_3^-] or another complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is the stepwise constant, and the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is β1 β2 β3 β4.

In the second approach, where each βn is stepwise, the denominator becomes 2.3646. Then, the fractions are as above, and X4 is 0.0676%.

But in this scenario, the dithiocyanato is X2 at 16.9%, which is option D.

Looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%, so that would be the answer if the βs are stepwise and the blue complex is X2.

But how to decide which approach is correct?

In the first approach, using the overall βs, the denominator is 64.468, and the fractions are X4=56%, which is not an option.

But in the second approach, denominator is 2.3646, fractions are X2=16.9%, which is an option.

So perhaps the correct approach is the second one, treating the βs as stepwise. So the answer would be 16.9%, option D.

But why? Because the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc., but without specifying whether they're stepwise or overall. In many cases, when a series of βs is given, they are the stepwise constants. For example, if you have [Co(SCN)_1], β1; [Co(SCN)_2], β2 is the stepwise (β1*β2), and so on.

Wait, but in reality, the stability constants are usually given as the overall β for each complex. So the first approach would be correct, which leads to X4 being 56%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question asks for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which would be X2 and X4. So in the first approach, X2 is 5.5%, X4 is56%, so together 61.5%. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which might be X3 or X4, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the βs as the overall constants. So each βn is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]. So:

β1=9 → [Co(SCN)]^+.

β2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

β3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3^-].

β4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

Wait, but that can't be correct because normally the β increases with the number of ligands. Here, β3=63 is higher than β2=40, which makes sense, but β4=16 is lower than β3. That seems odd. So perhaps the given βs are stepwise.

Wait, but if β4=16 is the stepwise constant for adding the fourth ligand, then the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4] is β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16=362880, which is much larger than β3=63. So the tetra complex is much more stable than the tri.

So in the first approach, where each βn is the overall, then the fractions are as before, and the major species is the tetra complex.

But since this leads to an answer not in the options, perhaps the mistake lies elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, but the SCN is in excess, so we can assume that all Co is complexed as much as possible. But I think the calculations accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the fraction of the Co that is in the dithiocyanato form, which is X2. So in the second approach, where βs are stepwise, X2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But the confusion is whether the given βs are stepwise or overall.

In conclusion, given that the options include 16.9% (option D), and that treating the βs as stepwise leads to that percentage, I think the correct answer is D)16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]

The complexes are:
\[
\text{Co}^{2+}, \, \text{Co(SCN)}^+, \, \text{Co(SCN)_2}^0, \, \text{Co(SCN)_3}^-, \, \text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}
\]

The stability constants are interpreted as **stepwise constants**, meaning each subsequent complex forms by adding one additional SCN⁻ ligand. The overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point:
\[
\beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 = 9 \cdot 40 = 360, \, \beta_3 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 \cdot \beta_3 = 360 \cdot 63 = 22680, \, \beta_4 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 \cdot \beta_3 \cdot \beta_4 = 22680 \cdot 16 = 362880
\]

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using:
\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

### Calculations:
1. **Denominator**:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 360(0.1)^2 + 22680(0.1)^3 + 362880(0.1)^4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

2. **Fractions of each species**:
   - \( f_0 = \frac{1}{64.468} \approx 0.0155 \, (1.55\%) \)
   - \( f_1 = \frac{9(0.1)}{64.468} \approx 0.014 \, (1.4\%) \)
   - \( f_2 = \frac{360(0.1)^2}{64.468} \approx 0.0556 \, (5.56\%) \)
   - \( f_3 = \frac{22680(0.1)^3}{64.468} \approx 0.3518 \, (35.18\%) \)
   - \( f_4 = \frac{362880(0.1)^4}{64.468} \approx 0.5628 \, (56.28\%) \)

3. **Interpretation**:
   The question asks for the percentage of the **blue dithiocyanato complex**, which corresponds to \( \text{Co(SCN)_2}^0 \) (the second complex). Its fraction is \( f_2 \approx 5.56\% \), which does not match any of the given options.

   However, if the stability constants are interpreted as **stepwise constants** rather than overall constants, the denominator changes:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

   Recalculating the fractions:
   - \( f_0 = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4226 \, (42.26\%) \)
   - \( f_1 = \frac{9(0.1)}{2.3646} \approx 0.3803 \, (38.03\%) \)
   - \( f_2 = \frac{40(0.1)^2}{2.3646} \approx 0.1690 \, (16.90\%) \)
   - \( f_3 = \frac{63(0.1)^3}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%) \)
   - \( f_4 = \frac{16(0.1)^4}{2.3646} \approx 0.0007 \, (0.07\%) \)

   In this case, the fraction of \( \text{Co(SCN)_2}^0 \) is \( f_2 \approx 16.9\% \), which matches **option D**.

### Conclusion:
The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to \( \text{Co(SCN)_2}^0 \), and its percentage is \( 16.9\% \).

**Answer: D**
