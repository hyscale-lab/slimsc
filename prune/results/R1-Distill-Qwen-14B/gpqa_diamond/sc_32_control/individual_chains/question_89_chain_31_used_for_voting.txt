Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. Let's see if I can work through this step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, giving a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each product is. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is a polycyclic structure. The 1,3-dibromo would mean there are Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane. When such a compound is treated with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, elimination would occur. Since there are two bromides, perhaps adjacent or in positions that allow for adjacent elimination. Wait, but 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. The 1 and 3 positions are likely on adjacent rings but not directly next to each other. So when KOH is used, it's a strong base, so it'll abstract a beta hydrogen, causing elimination of Br-.

Wait, but with two bromines, maybe we get a di-elimination? Or perhaps each Br undergoes elimination separately. No, wait, for each Br, the elimination would form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a diene. Because each elimination forms a double bond, and with two Br atoms, we might form two double bonds. But wait, the structure might not allow two double bonds because of the strain. Alternatively, perhaps it's one elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the product. The IR spectrum of product 1 has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's around the region for carbonyl groups, like ketones or esters. So maybe the initial reaction is not just elimination but some kind of oxidation or a different process. But wait, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction of a dibromide with KOH could lead to a vicinal diol or maybe an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH could undergo a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but if that's the case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some kind of ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Wait, KOH in what solvent? Maybe it's an aqueous solution, so it's a substitution. But substitution would replace Br with OH. So, 1,3-diol. But then why the IR peak at 1720? Unless the diol is oxidized, but that would require an oxidizing agent, which isn't present. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is more like elimination, but how? Let me think: if each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, perhaps elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in bicyclic structures unless the ring is sufficiently large. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with all single bonds, so perhaps elimination isn't possible. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but that doesn't explain the IR. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong reaction. Let's consider the IR data again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl group. So the product after KOH is a ketone. How would that happen? Maybe via oxidation, but again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, unless it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by an oxidation. But that would require another step, which isn't indicated.

Wait, perhaps the compound is treated with KOH, which causes the formation of a conjugate base, which then undergoes some kind of elimination and rearrangement to form a carbonyl group. Let me think about the reaction mechanism.

1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent bridgehead positions (maybe not, but for the sake of this problem, let's assume they can eliminate). When KOH is added, it deprotonates a beta hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. But if the resulting structure then has a carbonyl group, perhaps via some kind of keto-enol tautomerism or rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an alkene, but then another process forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how? Let me think of another reaction. Maybe the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene. Then, perhaps under certain conditions, that diene could undergo some kind of oxidation, but again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait a second, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Another possibility: When a dibromide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo a substitution, but that usually would replace Br with OH. So 1,3-diol. But how would that give a carbonyl in IR?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic displacement where the base (OH-) abstracts a proton leading to a carbocation. But wait, that's more for SN1 reactions. But with adamantane derivatives, which are highly branched and stable, maybe a carbocation forms. But then, with two Br atoms, perhaps each could lead to substitution.

Wait, maybe it's not substitution but elimination. Let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation, each Br would lose HBr, forming a double bond. But if two double bonds are formed, that would create a conjugated diene. But again, how does that lead to a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH isn't just a base but also acts as a nucleophile. Wait, perhaps the dibromide undergoes two eliminations to form a single carbonyl group. Wait, maybe via a mechanism where elimination leads to formation of a carbonyl. For example, the loss of two HBr molecules from adjacent carbons could create a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination forming a ketone. Let me think about vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides can eliminate to form alkenes. But if the structure is such that the carbons bearing Br are adjacent, elimination would form an alkene. But in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—the positions are not adjacent in the structure. So elimination may not form an alkene but perhaps a ketone.

Wait, another approach. The product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where methylene groups adjacent to oxygen (like in ethers or ketones) might appear. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably the adamantane's bridgehead protons, and 1.94 (2H) might be a methylene group. So product 1 has a carbonyl group (from IR) and some oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, 4.79 ppm for 2H could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group in a cyclic ether. But considering the IR shows a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone? Or perhaps a mono-ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure after KOH is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Wait, no, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol. But then, how would that give a carbonyl? Unless the diol is oxidized, but no oxidizing agent is present. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the product is a geminal diol, but that's unlikely because two OH groups on the same carbon are not typical from KOH substitution. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data more. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a methylene group next to an oxygen, maybe a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridgehead structure with an oxygen attached.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination where each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require each elimination to form a carbonyl, which is possible only if the structure allows such a process. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of a carbonyl via some kind of decomposition.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the formation of a ketone via elimination. Wait, like when a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) is treated with a base, it eliminates to form a carbonyl. But in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the Brs are on different carbons. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or some kind of carbocation rearrangement. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the result of a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. How? Let's imagine that each Br is on a carbon next to another. If each Br is on a carbon with a hydrogen that can be abstracted, perhaps elimination forms a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, but that might create a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating with KOH causes the formation of a diketone. Wait, but how? Let me think of the possible structures.

Suppose the adamantane structure is such that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. Then, when KOH is added, each Br could undergo elimination, removing HBr and forming a double bond. But if two double bonds are formed, that's a diene. But then, how does that form a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the double elimination leads to a conjugated diene, which might undergo some kind of oxidation. But again, no oxidizing agent is present.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diene, and then upon reaction with KOH, it undergoes further reaction. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a methyl group, and elimination leads to the loss of HBr and the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, that makes more sense. If each Br is on a carbon that's next to a methyl group, then elimination would form a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if the structure is such that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH group. So when KOH abstracts a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon, elimination of HBr occurs, and the double bond forms, but that would require that the adjacent carbon has a hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like the formation of a carbonyl via elimination of HBr from each Br, leading to two ketone groups.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the feasibility of that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm is for 2H. Maybe it's a methylene group next to oxygen, perhaps a ketone or an alcohol. The 2.41-2.23 is 10H, which could be the bridgehead hydrogens. And 1.94 is 2H, perhaps another methylene group.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, then the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak. And the NMR would have deshielded protons around 2.1-2.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a mono-ketone.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is an elimination that forms a carbonyl group via a process called dehydrohalogenation but in a way that forms a carbonyl instead of an alkene. How? Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group. So when HBr is eliminated, the CH2 becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if the structure is R-Br-CH2-R', then elimination would form R-CO-R'. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a neighboring group effect. But I'm not exactly sure.

Maybe I should move forward and see what the next step is, perhaps that will help.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an acyl chloride or a ketone, and this step is a Friedel-Crafts reaction.

Wait, but product 1 is from KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might not do much unless it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyl halide, and this step is an alkylation.

Wait, no, product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, so it's likely a ketone. So heating with Al(OiPr)3 might be facilitating some kind of acylation or alkylation. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane or some strained ring, but not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking at the final step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then worked up with dimethylsulfide to give product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So product 2 has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis gives product 3. The question is about the NMR of product 3.

So, putting this together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl)
2. product 1 → product 2 (with a double bond, via Al(OiPr)3)
3. product 2 → product 3 (after ozonolysis)

So, for product 2, which has a double bond, perhaps it's an alkene. So, product 2 is formed from product 1 via some kind of elimination or addition reaction catalyzed by Al(OiPr)3.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then product 2 is an ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon heating with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. Because Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid, it can catalyze dehydration of alcohols to form alkenes. So if product 1 is a diol, product 2 would be an alkene.

But then, how does product 1 have a carbonyl group? Because the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 isn't a diol but something else. Let me think again.

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an enol ether, which would have a double bond. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromide, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the overall process. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH gives a ketone. Then, that ketone is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form an enol ether, which has a double bond. Then, ozonolysis of the enol ether would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, product 2 is an alkene, and ozonolysis of that gives two carbonyl groups.

But given the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, product 1 must be a ketone. So product 2 must have a double bond adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, product 2 would be another structure with a double bond, perhaps an enol ether or an alkene. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a mono-ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether with a double bond between the two ketone groups.

But perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it into carbonyl groups. If the double bond is between two carbons that were previously connected to other groups, then ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl-containing fragments. So, in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably adjacent to a carbonyl.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like oxygen. So, let's imagine that product 3 has a structure with a carbonyl group, and perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, let me think about the coupling. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs and their splitting.

Suppose in product 3, the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Then, this CH2 would be split by adjacent Hs. For example, if each H in the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another group, perhaps they split into triplets or more.

Wait, for example, if the structure is something like CH2-CO-R, then the CH2 next to CO would have each H coupling with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two CH groups, each H would couple with two Hs on one side and maybe one on the other, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 has a carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. But how? Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the Al(OiPr)3 induces ring-opening to form an enol ether with a double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes elimination to form an alkene. That would make product 2 an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

In that scenario, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the Hs adjacent to them would be deshielded.

So, in product 3, the structure would have two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded Hs would be adjacent to these carbonyls. Let's say each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, each H in the CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, the Hs would have coupling with both the neighboring group and perhaps across.

Wait, let's think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a diene formed from a diol. Ozonolysis would cut each double bond into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis might produce two carbonyl groups connected by a chain.

But wait, ozonolysis of a diene typically gives a diepoxide, but with dimethyl sulfide as a workup, it would give aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a mono-ene. Ozonolysis would split into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, assuming product 2 is a simple alkene, like CH2=CH-R. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-Adamantane, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups at each end.

But wait, adamantane is a large structure. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene within the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, inserting O's and forming carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The Hs on the carbons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded Hs would be on the carbons next to the carbonyl groups. Let's say each of these carbons is CH2, so each H in CH2 would couple with the adjacent Hs.

For example, if the structure is:

CH2(O) - (some adamantane structure) - CH2(O)

Then, each CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have two Hs. Each H in CH2 would be coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the same group), and possibly another H from another group, but maybe it's only coupled to one neighboring group.

Wait, perhaps each H in the CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So each H would split into a triplet due to coupling with two neighboring Hs.

Wait, but wait. Let's consider that each H in the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So, each H in the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is next to another CH2 which is next to another CH2, the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Then, each H would have coupling with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let's think of a specific example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-Adamantane, then product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds: one at each end.

Wait, but adamantane is a four-ring structure, so perhaps the double bond is within the structure, and ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyls within the same molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclopropane, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, creating two carbonyl groups.

In that case, the product 3 would have two carbonyl groups adjacent to bridgehead positions. The Hs on the bridgehead carbons would be deshielded.

But bridgehead Hs are typically in unique environments. However, in the NMR, if those Hs are next to carbonyl groups, their coupling would depend on neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H in that CH2 is coupled with two Hs from another CH2 group.

In that scenario, each H would be a triplet due to coupling with two neighboring Hs.

Wait, another possibility: if the H is adjacent to a CH2 group and another CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would have coupling with two Hs on one side and perhaps one or two on the other. That could lead to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and one H from another, resulting in a triplet of triplets. Or maybe each H is coupled with two from one side and two from another, leading to a quartet.

But the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and pentet.

Hmm. Let me think differently. Let me consider the coupling in the ozonolysis product.

Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into carbonyl groups. If the alkene was part of a bridge, the product would have two carbonyl groups connected by the rest of the structure.

Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, creating two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure would have two carbonyl groups, and the adjacent CH2 groups would each have two Hs.

Each of these CH2 groups would be next to a carbonyl. The Hs in these CH2 groups would be deshielded and appear downfield. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring Hs.

If each CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent group, leading to a triplet for each H.

Alternatively, if the CH2 group is part of a larger structure where each H is coupled with three other Hs, then the pattern could be more complex.

Wait, but in the case where each H in the CH2 is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, and perhaps another H from another group, the splitting could become a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a different coupling pattern.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the electronegative group (the carbonyl). So, in product 3, if the structure is such that each carbonyl is next to a CH2 group, then the Hs in those CH2 groups are deshielded. Each H in CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs in the same group and perhaps one or two from another group.

But perhaps the coupling is between the Hs in the adjacent CH2 groups. For example, each H in CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

If that's the case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Wait, but looking at the options, triplet is option A, which seems plausible.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and one from another, it would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two from one side and two from another, it would form a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me try to draw a possible structure.

Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure would have two carbonyls connected via the bridge. Each bridgehead would have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, each CH2 group (next to carbonyl) would have two Hs. Each H in CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 and also next to a CH group, the coupling could involve more neighbors.

Wait, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 and another CH group. For example, a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2. Then, each CH2 group's Hs would be coupled with the adjacent CH2 and perhaps the CH group. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H in the CH2 is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, in that case, each H would have two coupling partners from each adjacent CH2 group, so each H would split into a triplet from each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe each H is only coupled with two Hs, giving a triplet.

But considering the options and the possible structures, I'm starting to think that the most likely coupling pattern is a triplet.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the deshielded H is part of an allylic position, but that's less likely because ozonolysis would break the double bond, so the Hs would be next to the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the possible product after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a double bond. Ozonolysis would convert the double bond into two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. So, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would each have two Hs. Each H in these CH2 groups would be next to two other Hs in the same group, leading to splitting into triplets.

So, each H would have a triplet coupling pattern. Hence, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

But looking back, the initial NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen (like a ketone or ether). So, product 1 might have a structure where a CH2 is next to a carbonyl. Then, product 2 could have a double bond adjacent to that CH2.

So, product 2 might be something like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2, but that's just a rough idea.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones. So, product 3 would be two carbonyl groups connected by a chain.

Suppose that each carbonyl is at the end of a CH2-CH2 group. So, each CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two Hs. These Hs would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the most deshielded Hs (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would each be triplets.

Therefore, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, followed by reactions with aluminum isopropoxide and ozonolysis. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3) based on its $^1$H NMR spectrum.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm$^{-1}$, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that product 1 is likely a ketone. The $^1$H NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) supports this, as the 4.79 ppm peak corresponds to a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen atom (e.g., a ketone).

2. **Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide**:
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid catalyst, to form product 2. This step likely involves the formation of a double bond, as product 2 undergoes ozonolysis in the next step. Thus, product 2 is likely an alkene or enol ether containing a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis**:
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. Therefore, product 3 contains carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen atoms in the $^1$H NMR spectrum are likely adjacent to these carbonyls.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:
   - The most deshielded hydrogen atoms in product 3 are on a CH$_2$ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen in this CH$_2$ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH$_2$ group. This results in a splitting pattern of a **triplet** for each hydrogen.

### Conclusion:
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**. 

ANSWER: A
