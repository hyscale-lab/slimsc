Alright, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let's try to break this down step by step. 

Okay, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the options provided. The options are all similar, varying by the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So first, let's look at each piece of data one by one and see what information they can provide.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. 

The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is likely due to O-H stretching. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But the position here is around 3000, which is a bit lower than typical O-H in alcohols (usually around 3300-3500). Wait, but maybe it's a broadening due to other factors. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group, like in a phenol or an alcohol. Phenols have broad O-H stretches because of hydrogen bonding in aromatic rings. So that's one possibility.

Then the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) stretching, or maybe another carbonyl group but in a different environment. Wait, could there be two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is conjugated or something else.

Wait, another thought: if the peak at 1700 is a carbonyl, then what? The other peak at 1650 could be an aromatic ring, like in a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in an aromatic ester or ketone? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester. Alternatively, the 1700 could be an ester or ketone carbonyl, and the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring. 

But wait, the 1650 is a bit lower than typical for an aromatic ring. Aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl. Let me think: maybe an ester has a carbonyl at around 1740, but if it's conjugated with an aromatic ring, the carbonyl might be at a lower wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but that would usually be a bit lower than 1700. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 1650 is an O-H bend? No, O-H bend is usually around 1600 for alcohols, but that's more for the bending. But the 1700 is the stretch, so that's more likely a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a C=C stretch in a conjugated system.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. So the structure must have a double bond, either isolated or conjugated.

Now the mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z=45. So let's think about that. 45 is a common fragment. What could give a mass of 45? Let me think about the possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (31 for CH3, but wait, 45 is actually for something else. Wait, 45 is the mass of (CH2O) but wait, 12+2+16=30? No, wait: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O? Or maybe it's (CH3)2CO, which is 58? Hmmm. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2O group, but that's 30. Wait, perhaps it's a fragment from a common group, like the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methoxy group or something else.

Wait, another approach: 45 in mass spec can correspond to the fragment from a ketone group, perhaps. For example, if the compound has a (CH3)2CO group, but wait, the molecular formula of (CH3)2CO is C3H6O, which is a molecular ion of 58 (since 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 16=16; total 58). So 45 is less than that. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)2CO, but that's 58 again.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think about the possible fragments. 45 could be CH3CO+ (43) but that's 43. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the (OCH2CH2) or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from an ester group. For example, if the molecule undergoes cleavage between the ester oxygen and the carbonyl, that could produce a fragment with a certain mass. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group split off with some oxygen.

But perhaps I should look elsewhere first. Let's go back to the molecular formula options.

The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. So, the degrees of unsaturation can help. 

Degrees of unsaturation formula is: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens, so X and N are zero.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2. 

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Wait, no, wait: each ring or double bond is one degree. So 1 degree could be one double bond or one ring. But wait, O doesn't affect this.

B) C6H10O: C=6, H=10.

Degrees = (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, or one double bond and one ring, or two rings.

C) C6H10O2: C=6, H=10, O=2.

Degrees = (14 -10)/2=2.

Same as B, but with O2.

D) C6H12O: C=6, H=12, O=1.

Degrees = (14-12)/2=1. So again, one degree.

Now, looking at the NMR: vinyl hydrogens are present, so that's a double bond, one degree. So the compound must have at least one double bond, so the degrees of unsaturation must be at least one. All options except B and C have the same degrees as A and D (1), but B and C have 2 degrees.

Wait, but according to the NMR, the compound has vinyl hydrogens, so it has a double bond, which contributes one degree. If there's another ring or another double bond, then the degrees would be higher.

Looking back, the FTIR has a peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl group, that's another degree. So if the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, that's two degrees. So that would mean options B and C (which have 2 degrees) are possible, while A and D (1 degree) would not account for both a carbonyl and a double bond. Wait, unless the carbonyl is part of a ring—like a cyclic ketone or ester—but that would still count as one degree (the ring) plus the carbonyl (but wait, the carbonyl is a double bond, so that's another degree). Hmm, perhaps that's complicating it.

Wait, let's think: a carbonyl is a double bond (C=O), so that's one degree. The vinyl hydrogens (C=C) is another degree. So that's two degrees of unsaturation. So the compound must have two degrees, which would mean options B and C (each has 2 degrees) are possible candidates, while A and D have only one, which wouldn't account for both groups.

So, the chemical formula must be either B or C: C6H10O or C6H10O2.

Now, let's think about the FTIR again. The peaks at 1700 and 1650.

If it's a carbonyl and another carbonyl, like in a conjugated system. For example, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (like an enone), which has C=C and C=O. That would give two peaks, one for each carbonyl. But wait, an enone has a conjugated C=C and C=O. Wait, but that's a single carbonyl, so the FTIR would only show one strong peak for the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has two different carbonyl groups. For example, an ester and a ketone. But that's less common.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 peak is an aromatic ring. Wait, but aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600. So 1650 is a bit higher. Could that be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester with an aromatic ring nearby? For example, if it's an aromatic ester, the carbonyl might be at a lower wavenumber due to conjugation.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the 1650 peak is an amide's N-H bend? No, that's usually around 1600. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with a substituent causing a shift.

Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But in that case, the compound would have both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. But then the degrees of unsaturation would be:

If the compound has a carbonyl (1) and an aromatic ring (3 double bonds? No, benzene is a ring plus three double bonds, which is 4 degrees. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, which counts as 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds). So that would require the compound to have four degrees of unsaturation, but our options don't have that. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible functional groups. The presence of O-H (from the IR) suggests an alcohol or a phenol. But if the FTIR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups around 1740, but conjugated esters (like in an aromatic ring) might be lower. Alternatively, a ketone would be around 1700-1750. 

So, putting this together: the compound has both a carbonyl group and an O-H group, as well as a double bond (from the vinyl H's in NMR).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures. For example, an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H, but their carbonyl is usually higher (around 1700). Alternatively, perhaps a phenol ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But that would have a carbonyl and an O-H (if it's a lactone, perhaps an internal ester without free O-H). Wait, lactones are cyclic esters, so they don't have an O-H group. So that's not matching the O-H in the IR.

Wait, so the O-H in IR is probably from an alcohol or phenol. So perhaps the compound is something like an allyl alcohol with a ketone or ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ester with a hydroxyl group. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Let's think about the mass spec again. A fragment at 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of butyraldehyde (CH3CH2CH2CHO, which is 88, so not that). Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment like (CH2)2CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps it's a ketene ion? Or maybe a CH3O group? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester. Esters typically have a molecular ion that breaks into the acid and alcohol parts. So if the ester is something like CH3CO-O-R, then the fragment could be the R-O- part. But not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible molecular formulas. For B: C6H10O. That would have a degree of 2. So it could be a compound with a double bond and a ring, or a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the presence of a carbonyl (from IR) and a double bond (from NMR) suggests two degrees, so either B or C. But let's think about each option.

Option B: C6H10O. So, 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, one oxygen. Possible structures: could be an alkene and an alcohol, or a cyclic ether with an alkene. But if it has a carbonyl (from IR), that would need another oxygen. Because a carbonyl is a double bond to O, which requires an O. So maybe option B is not possible because the oxygen count is only one. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl, which needs an O. So the formula must have at least two oxygens if the carbonyl is a ketone or ester, or one if it's an aldehyde. Wait, no, aldehyde is O, so that's one O.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The FTIR shows a peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So that could be an aldehyde, ketone, ester, or acid. 

Aldehyde: O in the formula is one. So if the compound is an aldehyde with an O-H group (like a aldehyde and alcohol), that would require two O's. Because the O-H is another O. So if the O count is two, that would fit option A or C.

Wait, but for option B, it's C6H10O. So only one O. So if the compound has a carbonyl (which needs O), but only one O total, then the carbonyl must be the only O. But then where's the O-H in the IR? Because the broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H. So that would require another O. So option B can't be the correct formula because it only has one O, but the FTIR shows both O-H and carbonyl (which would require two O's in the molecule). So option B is out.

So that leaves us with options C and maybe A and D. Wait, but earlier we thought it's two degrees because of the carbonyl and the vinyl group. So options C and B have two degrees, but B is only one O, which might not fit.

So, let's reevaluate. The O-H in the IR suggests at least one O for O-H. The carbonyl (C=O) suggests another O. So the formula must have at least two O's. That eliminates options B and D, which have one O each. So that leaves A and C.

Now, option A is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So one degree. Which is either a ring or a double bond. But the compound has vinyl hydrogens (a double bond), so that uses one degree, which leaves another degree for the carbonyl? Wait, no. Because the carbonyl is a double bond (C=O) which is another degree. So that would require two degrees, but option A only has one. So this is a problem. So perhaps option A is not possible.

Because option A has one degree, which can't account for both the double bond and the carbonyl. So that leaves option C: C6H10O2, which has two degrees. So that can account for both the double bond (from the vinyl H's) and the carbonyl (from the IR). So that fits.

So the formula is C6H10O2.

Now, let's think about what structures fit this. It's a six-carbon compound with two oxygen atoms, two degrees of unsaturation. So, it could be an ester. For example, methyl something.

Wait, but let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16) =72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z=114. But the fragment is at 45. So perhaps the molecule breaks into a fragment with 45.

What could give a mass of 45? Let's compute 45 in terms of possible groups. 45 = 12*3 + 1*6 + 16*0? Wait, 12*3 is 36, 3+6=9, so 36+9=45. So that's C3H6O? No, O is 16. So 3 carbons, 6 hydrogens, and one O would be 3*12=36 +6=42 +16=58. That's not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe 45 is (CH2)2CO? Let's compute: 2 CH2 (24) + CO (28)=24+28=52. No. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment without O. Wait, 45 could be C3H7 (39). Hmm, no. Or CH3CO+ (43), but that's 43.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. What structures have a mass fragment at 45? Maybe a fragment like (CH3)2CO, but that's 58. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a methyl group attached to another fragment. Wait, 45 is lower than the molecular weight of 114, so it's a smaller fragment.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+) but that's 91. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O is 64, but that's not 45). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, CH3-O- would have a molecular weight of 32 (16 +12 +1*3). Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe a methoxy group (31) but that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a propyl group. Propane is 46, but that's close. Wait, no, 45 would be C3H8O? Let me compute: 3*12=36, 8*1=8, 16=16, total 60. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. Let's see: a propanone fragment would be (CH3)2CO. But that's 58. Hmm. Alternatively, a smaller ketone.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2CO group. That's 44 (12*2 +1*4 +16=24+4+16=44). Close to 45 but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2O group. Which is 30. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3OCH2 group or something else. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. For example, if the ester is broken into the alcohol part. Suppose the ester is something like CH2CH2COO-R, and upon cleavage, the R-O group is a fragment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The possible structures could be an ester with a double bond, perhaps. For example, methyl vinyl benzoate? No, that's more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that would be a lactone. But lactones don't have O-H groups, as I thought earlier. So that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diester. But that would require more oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkenol ester. Like an ester with a double bond nearby. For example, an allyl ester. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2OOCR, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is that the mass spec has a fragment at 45. Let me think about what functional groups could lead to that.

Another thought: the fragment at 45 could correspond to the (CH2)2O group. Let's compute: 2 carbons (24), 2*2=4 hydrogens, 16 O. 24 +4 +16=44. Close to 45. Maybe it's a fragment with (CH2)3O? That would be 36 +3 +16=55. No.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with an oxygen. Propyl is 46, but perhaps a propyl group with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents. But if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, that's 6 carbons. If it's an aromatic compound, then perhaps it's a ring plus some substituents.

But considering the FTIR, the 1700 and 1650 peaks, perhaps it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. For example, a phenyl ester. But then O-H would come from where? Maybe a phenol group.

Wait, if it's a phenol ester, like phenyl acetate, but that would be more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like methyl vinyl ether, but that's not with O2. Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. Two degrees. So either two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. And the IR shows a carbonyl, which is another double bond. So that's two degrees, which fits option C.

So, putting it all together, the formula must be C6H10O2. Let's see which option that is. Option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the given data from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, and compare it with the provided molecular formula options: C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O.

### Key Observations and Analysis:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or phenol.
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system or aromatic ring.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (protons on a double bond) confirm the presence of an alkene group.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a common fragment, possibly from a functional group or structural motif.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation**:
   - The compound must account for the double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) and the carbonyl group (from the IR spectrum), requiring **two degrees of unsaturation**.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 1.  
  This formula accounts for only one degree of unsaturation, which cannot explain the presence of both a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) and a carbonyl group (from the IR spectrum).  
  **Eliminated.**

- **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 2.  
  While this formula accounts for two degrees of unsaturation, it has only one oxygen atom. The FTIR spectrum shows both an O-H group and a carbonyl group, requiring at least two oxygen atoms.  
  **Eliminated.**

- **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 2.  
  This formula accounts for two degrees of unsaturation, which can explain the presence of both a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) and a carbonyl group (from the IR spectrum). Additionally, it has two oxygen atoms, consistent with the O-H and carbonyl groups observed in the FTIR spectrum.  
  **Remains viable.**

- **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
  Degrees of unsaturation = 1.  
  Similar to Option A, this formula accounts for only one degree of unsaturation, which cannot explain the presence of both a double bond and a carbonyl group.  
  **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula that best fits the spectroscopic data and satisfies all the observations is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
