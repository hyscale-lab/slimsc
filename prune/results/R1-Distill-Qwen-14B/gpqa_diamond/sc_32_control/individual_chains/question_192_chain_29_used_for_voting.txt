Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember from my classes that when dealing with conductors, the charges behave in certain ways, especially when they're enclosed within a cavity.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, the conductor isn't a solid sphere but has this empty space inside. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, which is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The point P is also at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the setup is a bit like a two-center problem. The conductor has its own center, and the cavity's center is offset by s. The charge q is inside the cavity, so it's within the conductor's material?

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a conducting shell, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges. But wait, in this case, the conductor isn't a shell; it's a solid sphere with a cavity. Oh right, for a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor, and then the outer surface will adjust based on any overall charge. But in this case, the conductor itself is uncharged, so the inner induced charges must cancel any external fields inside the conductor.

So, the conductor is neutral. When we put a charge +q inside the cavity, it's like the conductor behaves as if the charge is at the center. Wait, no, because the cavity's center is shifted. Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, so the charge q is somewhere inside that cavity, which is off-center.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so when the charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner surface) will have induced charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the inner surface must have a charge -q because the original charge is +q. Then, the outer surface would have a charge +q to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The conductor is neutral, so the charges inside must be balanced. The charge +q in the cavity induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance the inner -q, right? Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer must be +q.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the outer charges, right? Because the conductor shields the inside. Oh wait, wait. The conductor's material is in electrostatic equilibrium. The field inside the conductor material (the part between the cavity and the outer surface) is zero.

But in this case, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there should be due to the charges on the outside of the conductor. The outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside would be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the conductor's center.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so any charge on the outer surface would distribute itself uniformly, right? So the field outside would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. But wait, in this problem, the charge is placed inside the cavity, which is not at the center. Does that affect the field outside?

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface will distribute uniformly regardless of where the internal charge is placed. So the external field depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q, and that's as if it's at the center of the conductor.

But wait, no, because the conductor's outer surface has a charge, but the way the field outside is calculated depends on the position relative to the center of the conductor. So point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the field there would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/L².

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So the electric field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², right? Because the charge outside the conductor is +q, and it's treated as if it's at the center.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the charge inside the cavity isn't at the center. But the conductor's outer surface's charge is, so it's as if the charge is at the center. So the field outside only depends on the outer charge. So the position of the inner charge within the cavity doesn't affect the external field—only the total charge on the outer surface does.

So the correct answer should be option B. The other options involve distances l and s, but since the field outside depends only on the outer charge and the distance from the conductor's center, option B is the way to go.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is uncharged, meaning its total charge is zero. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge $+q$, which is distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. The field outside the conductor is therefore as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Field Calculation**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity (e.g., the distances $s$, $l$, or the angle $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is unrelated to the external field.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. This involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the external field.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While it has the correct dependence on $l^2$, it does not account for the correct distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
