Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a problem in transfecting a plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The goal was to overexpress GADD45G with an HA tag, but it didn't work. They looked at the construct and found the plus strand sequence, and the options are about why it's not expressing.

Wait, so the construct is supposed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus. HA is usually a small peptide derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin. So the coding sequence should start with the HA sequence, followed by GADD45G.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, I need to check if the reading frame is correct and if there are any stop codons or issues that would cause early termination.

Let me break it down. The sequence starts with 5'ATG, which is the start codon. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but HA is a specific sequence. Let me think about the HA tag's amino acid sequence. HA is typically YPYDVPDYA, but the coding sequence would start with ATG followed by TAC (Tyr), then maybe CAT (His), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's DNA sequence is inserted before the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, does the HA tag sequence exist? Let me see. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, that's ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (Pro), TAC (Y), GAT (Asp), G... Hmm, that's the start. I'm trying to see if the HA tag's coding is present here. Let me recall that the HA tag is about 11 amino acids, so the DNA would be around 33 nucleotides.

Wait, maybe the HA sequence is in this part. Let me see. The first few codons are: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC... Wait, no, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the question says that the HA determinant is introduced at the N-terminus, so the construct should have the HA coding before the GADD45G. So the DNA should be HA followed by GADD45G.

So let's look for the HA coding. The HA tag is a specific sequence, so perhaps the first part of the plasmid's coding region is the HA. Let me think about the possible codons. The HA tag is usually: YPYDVPDYA, which translates from the DNA as TAC CCA TAT GAT GGT ATG TAC ATG TTA TCA GAA. Wait, maybe not exactly, but the point is the HA DNA would be a specific sequence.

Wait, looking at the given DNA, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GCT (A), TCA (S), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop? No, wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh wait, wait, in the given sequence, after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (Pro), TAC (Y), GAT (Asp), GCT (A), etc. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons.

Wait, the given sequence is the plus (sense) strand, so the coding is in the same direction. So any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the same reading frame would be a stop.

Looking at the first part: ATG TAC (start, Y), CCA (Pro), TAC (Y), GAT (Asp), GCT (A), TCA (S), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop). Oh! So the 10th codon is AAA (K) and then TGA, which is a stop codon. So that's a problem because the HA might end here, but actually, the HA tag is longer than that.

Wait, let me count the nucleotides. The first 30 nucleotides: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC ... So the first part of the coding sequence is:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GCT (A), TCA (S), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop). 

Oh! So the 11th codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the HA tag is supposed to be longer than that, so the construct has an in-frame stop codon after only 11 amino acids, which is way before the HA tag is complete. Wait, but HA is about 11 amino acids, but the stop comes at position 11. So that would terminate the translation early.

So the construct has a premature stop codon in the HA sequence, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early. So the HA wouldn't be properly expressed, and perhaps the GADD45G isn't either because the frame might be messed up.

Wait, no, if the HA is in the first part, and then after the stop comes other sequences, but the stop is in the same frame. So the ribosome would stop, and the HA wouldn't be expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is followed by the GADD45G, but the stop is in the HA, so the whole thing is truncated.

Wait, but the HA is being added at the N-terminus, so the plasmid should have the HA coding followed by GADD45G. If there's a stop in the HA, then the HA isn't made, and perhaps the GADD45G isn't either, unless it's in a different reading frame. But in this case, the stop is in the same frame, so the rest would not be translated.

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

That would make sense if there's a stop codon in the reading frame before the intended coding. So the HA is being introduced, but the stop is in the HA, causing early termination. So the GADD45G isn't expressed because the ribosome stops early.

Wait, but the plasmid was designed to have the HA followed by GADD45G. So any stop in the HA would prevent the rest from being expressed. So the problem is that the HA has a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early and not produce the full-length protein, including GADD45G.

So looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would be due to a premature stop codon.

Another option is option A: the HA sequence has a missense mutation. But a missense would change an amino acid, not cause a stop. So that's not the case here. In this case, the problem is a stop codon, which is a nonsense mutation, not a missense.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. Well, proteolysis would degrade the protein after it's made. But the problem here is that the construct isn't being expressed at all, or not correctly. So if the protein were made but then degraded, they might see lower levels. But the issue here is that the expression isn't happening.

Option D: no tRNA for UAA. UAA is a stop codon, but mammalian cells do have the release factors for all three stop codons. So that's not the issue.

So the problem is that the HA coding sequence has a premature stop codon, which leads to early termination. Therefore, the construct isn't producing the HA-GADD45G fusion protein, hence no overexpression.

So the correct answer is B. The ribosome terminated translation early because there's a premature stop codon in the HA sequence.

The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with the HA determinant at the N-terminus, failed to express the protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the coding sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) followed by a series of codons. However, the 11th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. This premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion protein from being expressed.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation would alter an amino acid but would not introduce a stop codon. Since the issue here is a premature stop codon, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B:** The presence of the TGA stop codon in the HA sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing proper expression of the protein. This matches the observed problem and is the correct answer.
- **Option C:** Proteolysis refers to the degradation of an already synthesized protein. However, the issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all due to early termination, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D:** Mammalian cells, including those in Chinese hamster ovary cells, have tRNAs and release factors for all three stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). Therefore, this is not the cause of the problem.

The root cause of the failure to overexpress the protein is the premature stop codon in the HA sequence, leading to early ribosome termination.
