Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

First, I remember that any vector in the x-z plane can be represented using spherical coordinates. The direction vector n can be expressed in terms of angles θ and φ, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ should be zero or π, maybe? Wait, no, actually, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So the direction vector n could have components in x and z, but not y. So the spherical angles would be θ and φ where φ is 0 or π, perhaps? Hmm, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the spin operator in an arbitrary direction, so I need to construct the operator P along n.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I know that the spin operator S along a direction n is given by S = (n_x Sx + n_y Sy + n_z Sz). Since the direction here is in the x-z plane, n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, in the x-z plane, y-component is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the direction vector. Let's say the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in x-z, perhaps φ is zero, making it (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but maybe that's not necessary right now.

Wait, no, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in x-z, perhaps φ is either 0 or π/2? Wait, no, because the x-z plane is defined by y=0, so any direction there has components in x and z, but no y. So the direction vector can be written as (a, 0, b), where a and b are real numbers such that a² + b² = 1. So, for example, the unit vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. That makes sense.

So the operator P along n would be given by P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component is zero, so Py doesn't contribute. So P = (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z), and since n is a unit vector, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

Wait, but the question isn't directly about the operator. It's asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvector equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but P is the operator along n, which is a combination of Px and Pz. So let me write that out.

Given that P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.

So P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P = (n_x) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z) * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Simplify that. Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[n_z, 0], [0,-n_z]]
Adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]
Multiply by (ħ/2).

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Wait, but P is already (ħ/2) times some matrix. So let me write that:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the factor, getting:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

| n_z  n_x |   |a|   = |a|
|n_x  -n_z |   |b|     |b|

Which becomes the two equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange each equation.

First equation: n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → equation (1)

Second equation: n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0 → equation (2)

Now, we can express these as a system of linear equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can write this in matrix form:

[ (n_z -1)    n_x   ] [a]   = [0]
[  n_x      -(n_z+1) ] [b]     [0]

For non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Compute the determinant:

(n_z -1)(- (n_z +1)) - (n_x)^2 = 0

Expanding:

- (n_z -1)(n_z +1) - (n_x)^2 = 0

Which is:

- (n_z^2 -1) - n_x^2 = 0

→ -(n_z^2 + n_x^2) +1 =0 → since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 (as n is a unit vector), this becomes 0. So the determinant is zero, which makes sense as it's an eigenvalue equation.

So the equations are dependent, and we can find the ratio of a and b.

Let me take equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → n_x b = (1 -n_z) a → b = [ (1 -n_z) / n_x ] a

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → let me express n_x in terms of θ. Since n is in x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting:

b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a

Simplify numerator: 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)

Denominator: sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2 )

So b = tan(θ/2) a → b = [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ] a → b = (sinθ/2) a / cosθ/2 → so ratio is a : b = 1 : tan(θ/2 )

Alternatively, the eigenvector can be written as proportional to (1, tan(θ/2)).

But to find the normalized eigenvector, we need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The vector is |v> = [ a; b ] = [ a; (1 - cosθ) a / sinθ ] → substituting from above.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to let a = cos(θ/2) and b = sin(θ/2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can express the vector in terms of θ.

Wait, let's think about spin-1/2 particles. The eigenvectors of spin in a direction n are given by the spin coherent states. For spin up along n, the state is |+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T. But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so e^{iφ} would be 1. So the state would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But wait, let's check. Suppose θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the eigenstate for spin-up is |+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T. Since in our case, φ is zero, because the direction is in the x-z plane (so φ is 0 or π), so the state simplifies to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but in the general case, the eigenvectors for spin in direction (θ, φ) are |+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T. So in our case, φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane.

So the normalized eigenvector would have components (cosθ/2, sinθ/2), and multiplied by ħ? No, because the options don't have ħ in the components, except option D.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is (cosθ/2, sinθ/2), which matches what I was thinking. Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which is more like a polar angle representation but perhaps not normalized correctly. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by ħ, but that seems unrelated to the θ/2 terms.

But wait, the problem statement asks for the normalized eigenvector. So the vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] is already normalized because cos² + sin² =1. So the normalized eigenvector is (cosθ/2, sinθ/2), which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) (sqrt{2/3} ħ, sqrt{1/3} ħ) → Not depending on θ, so not correct.

B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ) → That's an expression for a vector with magnitude 1, but it's not the same as the eigenvector components.

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → This matches what I derived.

D) (sqrt{2/3} ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt{1/3} ħ sin(theta/2)) → This would be the case if the eigenvector was not normalized, but multiplied by some constants. Wait, no, because sqrt(2/3)^2 + sqrt(1/3)^2 = (2/3 +1/3)=1, so it is normalized. But why would it have these coefficients? That seems unrelated to the problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem.

The given operator P is for a muon, but the muon's spin is 1/2, same as an electron. The operator components are given. So the approach is correct.

Wait, but the way I derived the eigenvector is [a, b] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But looking at option C, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be correct. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but in the options, the options are given as "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's take a concrete example. Suppose the direction is along the z-axis (θ=0). Then the eigenvector should be |up> = [1, 0]^T. Using option C, cos(0/2) = cos(0) =1, sin(0/2)=0. So that works.

Another example: direction along x-axis (θ=π/2). Then the eigenvector should be (0,1)^T. Using option C, cos(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So the vector would be [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which when multiplied by (1/sqrt(2)) is normalized. Wait, but this is in the form [1,1]/sqrt(2), but for the spin-up along x, the eigenvector is [0,1], wait no, wait.

Wait, for the x-direction, the spin-up state is (|↑x> )= 1/sqrt(2) [1,1]^T. Because Sx has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), normalized.

Wait, but according to option C, if θ=π/2, then cos(theta/2)=cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, same for sin(theta/2). So the vector would be [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is 1/sqrt(2) [1,1], which is correct for spin-up along x. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options don't have the 1/sqrt(2) factor. Oh wait, no, option C has (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct because that vector is already normalized. So the answer would be option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is constructed as $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the given components of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, the matrix for $P$ becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$, where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and simplifying, the eigenvector components $(a, b)$ satisfy the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
\]

Using $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the ratio of $a$ to $b$ is found to be $b = \tan(\theta/2) a$. The normalized eigenvector is then expressed as:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form given in option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived result:

- **Option A**: Does not depend on $\theta$ and is unrelated to the eigenvector structure.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate system but does not match the eigenvector derived for this problem.
- **Option D**: Includes unnecessary normalization factors and does not align with the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by option C.
