Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are all mixed together. The options given are in kcal and kJ, so I should probably pay attention to the units.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But wait, these are all different acids and a base. Oh, and H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic, so it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but I think it's a dihydroxide, so it can provide two OH- ions per formula unit.

So the first step is probably to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution, then see what's the limiting reactant because not all the H+ or OH- might react.

Let's break it down. For each solution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
   Moles HCl = Molarity × Volume (L)
   Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L.
   So moles HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

2. H2SO4: It's a strong acid and it's diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+.
   Volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L.
   Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+ (because 2 H+ per mole).

3. Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions.
   Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L.
   Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, wait. So total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol H+. And OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol.

But in neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So the limiting reactant is the one with fewer moles. Hmm, because 0.28 mol H+ vs 0.2 mol OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 mol OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

The reaction will produce water: H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of OH- consumes one mole of H+.

So, moles of H+ consumed = 0.2 mol → so 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+ remaining.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting. I think the standard value is about -57.3 kJ/mol for strong acid-strong base reactions. But let me check the context.

Wait, actually, the enthalpy of neutralization for a monoprotic acid and base is about -57.3 kJ/mol. But in this case, H2SO4 is diprotic. So when it reacts with a base, both H+ ions are neutralized. Wait, but in this problem, the base is Ba(OH)2, which provides two OH- per formula unit.

Wait, but when I'm combining all these, maybe I should consider the overall reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and find out how much actually reacts, then calculate the enthalpy based on that.

So, the total H+ available: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.
Total OH- available: 0.2 mol.

So, the reaction can proceed until either H+ or OH- is exhausted. Since OH- is less, all OH- will react, and the excess H+ will remain.

So neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O. Enthalpy change per mole is about -57.3 kJ/mol.

So total enthalpy change is moles of OH- (0.2) × (-57.3 kJ/mol) → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. Hmm, alternative calculation.

Wait, but wait. The H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Does that affect the way we handle the reaction? Let me think.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ ions. But in the reaction with Ba(OH)2, which gives 2 OH- per mole, the stoichiometry might be different. Because each Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two H+ from the acid.

Wait, perhaps I should write the net ionic equation.

Let me think about the individual reactions.

HCl is H+ + Cl^-.

H2SO4 (strong acid) → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So, when these are mixed, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So regardless of the source, each H+ reacts with OH-.

So the total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

The OH- available is 0.2 mol.

So, the reaction consumes 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ will be in solution, along with excess sulfate and chloride ions, and Ba^2+.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) → -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options have some in kJ and others in kcal. Let me check the options:

Options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, my calculation is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit off. Option B is in kcal: -11.42 kcal.

Wait, wait, but wait. Did I mess up the units? Because 57.3 kJ is per mole of H+.

Wait, 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, 57.3 kJ * (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) → approximately 13.7 kcal.

So, per mole of H+ reacting, it's -57.3 kJ or about -13.7 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ → which is about -2.75 kcal? No, wait wait, no. Wait, no, 57.3 kJ is per mole, so 0.2 moles would be -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -2.75 kcal? Wait, no. Because 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal, so 0.2 moles would be -2.74 kcal. Wait, that's conflicting with the prior calculation.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So for each mole of H+ that reacts, it's -57.3 kJ. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 kJ. Alternatively, converting to kcal: 57.3 kJ is 13.7 kcal, so 0.2 moles would be 2.74 kcal (but with a negative sign), so about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but the options have B as -11.42 kcal and D as -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. So, let me compute 57.3 kJ per mole times 0.2 mol: 57.3 * 0.2 = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ. So, looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Hmm, no match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but that would be if I used 57.3 kJ per mole and converted to kcal.

Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ → 1 kJ ≈ 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So, 11.46 kJ is 11.46 * 0.239 ≈ 2.74 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but that's not matching any option. Let me check the options again. Option A is -2.72 kcal. That's close to -2.74. Hmm, but why would the answer be in kJ or kcal? Wait, the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization", which typically is in kJ/mol. But the options have both units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess, and compute based on that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial thinking is wrong. Maybe the moles are not just H+ and OH-? Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, which is a diprotic base (each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-), so the reaction would be between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 in a 1:1 molar ratio, producing BaSO4 and water.

Wait, perhaps I should write the molecular equation.

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing 2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but that's a molecular equation. The ionic equation would be:

2 H+ (from H2SO4) + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

But in our case, we have HCl and H2SO4 acids and Ba(OH)2 as the base.

So perhaps the total H+ is from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- is from Ba(OH)2.

But when you mix them, the H+ and OH- combine to form water. So the total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol H+.

The OH- available is 0.2 mol.

So the neutralization would consume 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

So the enthalpy change would be based on 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. Each mole of H+ contributes -57.3 kJ, so 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is close to 11.46 kJ converted to kcal. Let me compute that.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So, enthalpy change is approximately -2.74 kcal. Which is very close to option A's -2.72 kcal. Hmm, but why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the molarity correctly.

Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the previous calculations are correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but when it reacts with H2SO4, which is diprotic, the reaction consumes two OH- per H2SO4. Hmm, but in any case, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio regardless of the source.

Wait, no, because for each mole of Ba(OH)2, you get 2 OH-, so each H+ from any source will react with an OH-.

So, the initial approach is correct.

Hmm, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal, which would be option A (-2.72 kcal). But option B is in the same magnitude but in kJ as option D isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not giving the correct answers. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the dilution effect, but the problem doesn't mention it, so probably not.

Wait, another thought. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is for a strong acid and strong base, producing 1 mol of water. But in this case, when mixing different solutions, perhaps the total volume affects the concentration, but the enthalpy is per mole of reaction, so volume shouldn't affect the calculation. Unless the problem expects the use of the concentrations to compute something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total enthalpy change, not per mole. So if we calculate the moles and multiply by the enthalpy per mole, we get the total enthalpy.

Wait, but the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Let's compute 0.2 moles * 57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ. So, if the answer is in kJ, it would be approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ. But none of the options match that except option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much higher.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the stoichiometry? Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of neutralization for each acid and base might vary depending on their strength, but the problem probably assumes all are strong, so the standard value applies.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reagent, then compute the enthalpy accordingly.

So, total H+ = 0.28 mol (as before), OH- = 0.2 mol.

The limiting reagent is OH-, so only 0.2 mol of H+ reacts.

Each mole of H+ gives -57.3 kJ. So, 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, which is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal. So why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be if I thought that 0.2 moles of H+ × 57.3 kJ → but then converting to kcal.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me try that.

57.3 kJ is equal to 57.3 /4.184 ≈ 13.7 kcal. So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * 13.7 = 2.74 kcal. So the change is -2.74 kcal, which is about -2.72 kcal (option A). So why does option B exist as -11.42 kcal?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change, but considering both H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy change for each acid-base pair.

Wait, for example, HCl and Ba(OH)2, and H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

But that complicates things. Let me think about that.

HCl (strong acid) reacting with Ba(OH)2 (strong base).

The reaction would be HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But the stoichiometry is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with 2 moles of HCl.

Similarly, H2SO4 (strong acid) reacting with Ba(OH)2: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, in this case, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2.

So, perhaps I should compute the moles of each acid and base and see how much reacts.

So, let's compute the moles for each reaction.

First, for HCl and Ba(OH)2:

Moles HCl = 0.1 mol.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.1 mol.

The reaction ratio is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2.

So, available HCl is 0.1 mol, needed is 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 mol Ba(OH)2 for complete reaction. But we have only 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, which can react with 0.2 mol HCl.

But wait, available HCl is 0.1, which is less than 0.2. So, HCl is the limiting reagent here.

So, moles of HCl reacting: 0.1 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 reacting: 0.1 / 2 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, no. Because for each mole of Ba(OH)2, you need 2 moles of HCl.

So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 would require 0.2 mol HCl. But only 0.1 HCl is present. So HCl is limiting.

Thus, all 0.1 mol HCl will react with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2.

So, the reaction will produce 0.05 mol BaCl2 and 0.1 mol H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction is 0.1 mol HCl × (-57.3 kJ/mol) → -5.73 kJ.

Wait, but that's the enthalpy per mole of HCl reacting. Alternatively, considering that each mole of HCl provides one mole of H+.

Then, for this reaction, all 0.1 mol H+ from HCl reacts. Each mole releases 57.3 kJ, so 0.1 * 57.3 = 5.73 kJ. Since it's exothermic, it's negative.

Next, for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Moles H2SO4 = 0.09 mol.

Moles Ba(OH)2 remaining after reacting with HCl: 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, 1:1 ratio.

Moles H2SO4 = 0.09, Ba(OH)2 = 0.05.

So Ba(OH)2 is the limiting reagent here.

So, all 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 will react with 0.05 mol H2SO4.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So, the reaction would involve 2 H+ and 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So, moles H+ consumed: 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol.

Moles OH- consumed: 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol.

Enthalpy change: 0.1 mol H+ × (-57.3 kJ/mol) → -5.73 kJ.

So, total enthalpy change from both reactions is (-5.73) + (-5.73) = -11.46 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.46 kJ. So, the answer would be D) -16.0 kJ? No, because -11.46 isn't close. Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So 0.2 moles × 13.7 kcal/mol → 2.74 kcal. But now, in this approach, the total is 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 moles H+ reacting. So total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ ≈ -11.46 kJ.

So, if the options have D as -16.0 kJ, that's not matching. But option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 11.46 kJ in kcal: 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So, not matching.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should consider the enthalpy in terms of per mole of reaction, but perhaps I'm not considering the correct stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of both H+ ions from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2's OH-.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- available, find the minimum, and compute the enthalpy based on that.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

Limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options match except perhaps if I made a mistake in units.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, -11.46 kJ is not an option, but option B is -11.42 kcal. So, 11.42 kcal is approximately 11.42 × 4.184 ≈ 47.63 kJ. Which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ but the option is in kcal, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the enthalpy change using per mole of H+ reacting, but in kcal.

If 1 mole of H+ → -57.3 kJ = -13.7 kcal.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 × (-13.7) = -2.74 kcal. Closest option is A) -2.72 kcal.

But earlier, when considering the reactions, the total was -11.46 kJ, which is -2.74 kcal. That would point to option A.

But why is there a discrepancy when I approach it via the two-step reaction?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the two-step approach.

Wait, in the two-step approach, the first reaction is HCl and Ba(OH)2, which uses 0.1 mol HCl and 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2, giving 0.1 mol H2O, enthalpy change -5.73 kJ.

The second reaction is H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which uses 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 and 0.05 mol H2SO4, producing 0.1 mol H2O, enthalpy change -5.73 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but that's the same as the initial approach. So, why is the option A) -2.72 kcal present?

Wait, perhaps the problem considers only the strong acid and strong base reaction, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so maybe each H+ contributes.

But in the initial approach, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2. So, 0.2 mol H+ reacting, which would be 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So, the answer in kJ is not exact, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal.

Wait, but 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). So the enthalpy change is -2.74 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal), but perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 57.3 * 0.2 = 11.46 kJ → which is 11.46 /4.184 = 2.737 kcal, so approximately -2.74 kcal. So the correct answer would be A) -2.72 kcal, but that's not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent, 0.2 mol reacting, H+ consumed is 0.2 → H+ left: 0.08.

So, 0.2 mol H+ → 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Hmm, but none of the options have that exactly. So the possible conclusion is that the intended answer is option B) -11.42 kcal, but that would mean considering the total enthalpy in kcal, which would be 11.46 kJ ≈ 2.74 kcal. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the closest is option D) -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps the correct approach is to select option B) -11.42 kcal, but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the initial approach and should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the limiting reagent again.

Wait, another approach: the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, with enthalpy change of -57.3 kJ per mole.

Total H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So, 0.2 moles react, giving 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Which is -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, none have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is D) -16.0 kJ, which is way off. Or perhaps the intended answer is option B) -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same as 11.46 kJ. But that would be incorrect unit-wise; the conversion is off.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ but with the units in kcal. Alternatively, perhaps the moles are being miscalculated.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the H2SO4 is not a strong acid in dilute solution, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value, such as -56.9 kJ/mol, leading to a more precise calculation.

Wait, 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. If the problem rounds it to two decimal places, that's -11.46 kJ, which isn't present. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total volume when mixed and calculate the concentration, but enthalpy is per mole, so that shouldn't matter.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy per mole of reaction considering all the solutions, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the majority of the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2, and the H+ comes from both acids, but the limiting reagent is OH-, so only 0.2 moles react.

So, the correct enthalpy is -11.46 kJ, but since none of the options match, perhaps I should see the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. 11.42 kcal is about 48.9 kJ (since 11.42 ×4.184 ≈ 48.0 kJ). But that doesn't align with our calculation of -11.46 kJ.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps the correct approach is to go with the initial conclusion that the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which isn't among the options, but the closest is D) -16.0 kJ, which is too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of H+.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate everything again.

Moles HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol H+.

Moles H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Moles Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 → 0.2 OH-.

Total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

So, OH- is limiting, 0.2 moles H+ and OH- react.

Enthalpy change = 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So, the correct answer should be -11.46 kJ, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B) -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.46 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is 2.74 kcal, so why would option B be -11.42 kcal? That's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to present the answer in kcal but miscalculated, or perhaps the correct answer is B) -11.42 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ and the closest option is not present. But since option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So, correct.

Thus, the correct answer is -11.46 kJ, which is not among the options. But wait, looking again, option B is -11.42 kcal. That would require 57.3 kJ per mole in kcal, which is 13.7 kcal per mole. 0.2 *13.7=2.74 kcal → but option B is about 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.74 kcal. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but 0.2 mol H+ ×13.7 kcal per mole=2.74 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is A) -2.72 kcal, but I'm getting confused because earlier I thought the enthalpy change was -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. So option A is the correct one.

But why would the options have B as -11.42 kcal? Oh, wait—perhaps I made a mistake in considering the units. Let me think: 57.3 kJ per mole is the same as 13.7 kcal per mole. So, 0.2 moles would be 2.74 kcal. So, the correct answer is option A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but in the first approach, I thought the answer was -11.46 kJ, but when considering the correct unit conversion, it's -2.74 kcal. So, the correct answer should be option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \)  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base, dihydroxide):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to give 2 moles of OH⁻, so total \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).
   - The reaction \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \) proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is present in fewer moles, it is the limiting reactant. Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \), leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.7 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) neutralized.
   - Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) reacts, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Closest to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This would correspond to \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \) incorrectly converted to kcal.
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Too far from the calculated value.
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Too far from the calculated value.

The correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change when converted to kcal.

Answer: A
