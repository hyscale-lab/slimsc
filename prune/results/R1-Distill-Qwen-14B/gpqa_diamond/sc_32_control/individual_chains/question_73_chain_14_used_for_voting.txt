Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, so I need to calculate two things: the relative velocity and the total energy. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, the relative speed. Wait, wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember something about the velocity addition formula which is different from classical mechanics. The formula, if I recall correctly, is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity should be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, let me think: so astronaut A has speed 0.6c, astronaut B has 0.5c. So in the frame where A is moving, what is the speed of B? Or is it the other way around? Oh, wait, the relative speed would be how fast one sees the other moving. So if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428... which is about 0.14c. So that would be the relative speed.

Wait, but I should double-check the formula. Let me write it properly. The relative velocity v_rel is (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). So yes, that's correct. So v_rel is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.14286c. So that's approximately 0.14c, which matches one of the options.

Wait, let me check the options. Looking back, option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D says 0.14c and E=5mc². So I'll have to calculate the total energy as well.

For the total energy, I need to compute the relativistic energies of each astronaut and sum them. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for A: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E_A = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for B: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c².

So looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That matches both calculations.

Wait, another thought: but wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." In relativity, the system's energy should include the rest mass energy as well. Wait, but each astronaut is moving, so their kinetic energy is in addition to their rest mass. So the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies, which includes rest mass and kinetic. So that should be correct.

Alternatively, if the system's rest frame is the center of momentum frame, the total energy would be different. But wait, the question doesn't specify the frame; it just says "the total energy of the system." Hmm, maybe I need to consider that? Or perhaps the question is in the lab frame where one astronaut is at rest? No, no, both are moving in the same direction.

Wait, wait, no, the system's rest frame would have zero total momentum. But the question isn't asking about that. It's asking for the total energy of the system. So in any case, the total energy would be E_A + E_B as I calculated because energy is frame-dependent. Hmm, but the options are given in terms of 'mc²', so perhaps we can compute it correctly.

Wait, let me recalculate E_A and E_B.

E_A:
v =0.6c, mass=2m.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25.

E_A = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

E_B:
v=0.5c, mass=3m.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1.1547.

E_B = 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈3.464 m c².

Adding them: 2.5 +3.464=5.964 m c² ≈5.96.

So that would be option C, which says E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc².

So our calculation for E is about 5.96, so option C is correct for E.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**Option C: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\).**
