Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a big role. The question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I think the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Wait, the problem gives me phase shifts: δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4. Oh, right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum over these phase shifts. The formula I'm trying to recall is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{2iδl} sin(lθ) ) ), where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. But wait, this is for each partial wave. But I might have to think about the specific form when evaluating the amplitude along the beam direction.

Wait, along the incident beam direction, that's θ = 0 degrees, right? So the scattering angle is zero. So for each term in the sum, sin(l * θ) would become sin(l * 0) which is zero, except when l=0? Because when l=0, it's sin(0) = 0. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, for l=0, the term is (2l +1) e^{2i δ0} sin(0 * θ) which is zero. So that would suggest that the scattering amplitude is zero at θ=0? That doesn't seem right. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2i δl} sin(lθ + δl) ) ), but no, I think that's not correct either. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is expressed as f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2i δl} sin(lθ) ) ), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's e^{2iδl} = cos δl + i sin δl, so when you take the imaginary part, it would involve the sine of δl multiplied by some terms.

Wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction. So I need to find Im[f(0)]. So let's think about each term in the sum.

At θ=0, sin(lθ) = 0 for all l except l=0... Oh wait, no, lθ is l times 0, which is 0 for any l, so sin(0)=0. So each term in the sum would be zero. That can't be right because then the amplitude would be zero, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. The general expression is f(θ,φ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ) ) e^{i l φ} ), assuming the scattering is symmetric in φ. But since the problem asks along the incident beam, which is probably along the z-axis, and θ=0, so φ would be zero or perhaps doesn't matter. Wait, but at θ=0, the phi angle doesn't come into play because the direction is along the beam.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the partial wave expansion in terms of the Legendre polynomials. Wait, another approach: The differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², but we're asked about the imaginary part of the amplitude itself.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the optical theorem. The optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (Im f(0)) to the total cross-section. The formula is something like Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total. But wait, the problem doesn't give the total cross-section. So maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, the scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Hmm, but that might complicate things. At θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, and 0 for l>0. Wait, no, that's not right. P_l(1) is 1 for all l because the Legendre polynomial evaluated at 1 is 1. So that would mean for each l, the expression becomes (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} * 1. So f(0) would be (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, that makes sense. So f(0) is (1/k) times the sum from l=0 to whatever of (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

But the problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4, so l goes up to 4. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So f(0) = (1/k) [ (2*0 +1) e^{2i δ0} + (2*1 +1) e^{2i δ1} + (2*2 +1) e^{2i δ2} + (2*3 +1) e^{2i δ3} + (2*4 +1) e^{2i δ4} ]

Wait, but the problem asks for the imaginary part of f(0). So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

But first, I need to compute each term. Let me list the phase shifts given:

δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

Each e^{2i δ_l} can be written as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l).

So for each l, compute (2l+1) multiplied by (cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l)), then sum all these terms.

Then, the imaginary part will be the sum of (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l).

But wait, because f(0) is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of these terms. So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ].

But I don't know what k is. Wait, what's k in this context? k is the wave number, which is related to the momentum of the electrons. The electrons have 50 MeV energy. Hmm.

Wait, the electrons are non-relativistic? No, 50 MeV is a high energy, so relativistic effects are significant. But for the purpose of calculating k, perhaps we can use the relativistic relation.

The momentum p is given by sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ), where E is the total energy.

Wait, but wait, for an electron, the rest mass energy is about 0.511 MeV. So E=50 MeV is much larger than m_e c^2, so relativistic.

So, the total energy E = K + m c^2, where K is kinetic energy. But in high energies, K ≈ E, so for approximation, perhaps E ≈ pc. Wait, in natural units (c=1), E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ), but when E >> m, E ≈ p. So p ≈ E = 50 MeV/c.

Wait, but I need to compute k. The wave number k is p / ħ. So let's compute p first.

Wait, let's compute p in appropriate units. Let me recall that:

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So rearranging, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but units might be tricky. Let me think in terms of MeV and meters.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in natural units where ħ = c = 1.

Wait, but let me think step by step.

Given E = 50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So,

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 → p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c^2 → Wait, no, wait.

Wait, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 )

So,

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 → p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) / c.

But I'm getting a bit confused about units. Let's think in terms of units where ħ = c = 1. In that case, E (in MeV) is equal to the mass times c^2, and momentum p would be in MeV/c units.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute p in terms of MeV/c using E and the mass.

So,

E = 50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) → p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c^2 → Wait, no, no, because E is in MeV, m_e c^2 is in MeV, so the equation becomes:

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 ) → p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c → but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps in units where c=1, then E (in MeV) is in energy units, and p is in MeV (since E = pc when c=1). So,

p = sqrt( E^2 - m_e^2 ) → which is sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261 ) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ about 49.9976 MeV.

So p ≈ 50 MeV.

Then, k is p / ħ.

But ħ in units of MeV·s is a bit tricky, but perhaps when we express everything in terms of ħc, which is a common unit in particle physics.

Wait, I think that the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ. But in natural units where ħ = c = 1, k = p. So perhaps in this case, k is approximately 50 MeV.

Wait, but we need to compute k in inverse femtometers because the answer is in fm. Let me recall that 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, but let me convert everything to MeV.

1 GeV = 1000 MeV.

So ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s = 6.582 × 10^-22 MeV·s.

But wait, I think it's easier to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers. Let me recall that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

Because ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, which is a commonly used value.

So, since p is approximately 50 MeV/c, and k = p / ħ.

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But since ħc is 197.33 MeV fm,

We can write ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Wait, no, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

k = p / ħ.

p is 50 MeV/c.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But ħ in units of MeV s is 6.582e-25 MeV s.

Wait, but I think it's easier to express everything in terms of ħ c.

Alternatively, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm,

So, 1 fm = ħ c / (197.33 MeV) )

Wait, perhaps I can compute k as:

k = p / ( ħ c ) * c / ħ → Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, since p = 50 MeV/c, and k = p / ħ.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Wait, converting GeV to MeV:

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s = 6.582e-22 MeV s.

But I need to get k in inverse femtometers (1/fm).

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Wait, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute k as follows:

k = p / ħ

p = 50 MeV / c.

So,

k = (50 MeV / c) / ( ħ )

But since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm,

We can write ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Substituting into k:

k = (50 MeV / c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) )

The c's cancel, and MeV units cancel:

k = 50 / (197.33 fm^{-1}) ) → 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Given that p = 50 MeV/c.

Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm,

Then, ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

So,

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )

The MeV and c cancel:

k = 50 / (197.33 fm ) → approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Now, back to the original problem. The imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l +1) sin(2 δ_l).

So, to compute Im[f(0)], it's (1/k) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

So let's compute each term for l=0 to 4:

l=0: (2*0 +1) =1. δ0=90°, so sin(2*90°)=sin(180°)=0. So term is 1 * 0 =0.

l=1: (2*1 +1)=3. δ1=67°, sin(134°)= sin(180-46)= sin(46°)≈ 0.7193.

So term is 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: (2*2 +1)=5. δ2=55°, sin(110°)=sin(70°)≈0.9397.

So term is 5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3: (2*3 +1)=7. δ3=30°, sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660.

Term:7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9. δ4=13°, sin(26°)=approx 0.4384.

Term: 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now, sum all these terms:

0 (l=0) + 2.1579 (l=1) +4.6985 (l=2) +6.062 (l=3) +3.9456 (l=4)

Adding them up:

2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184

12.9184 +3.9456≈16.864.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

Now, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * 16.864.

We have k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im[f(0)] = (1 / 0.253 ) * 16.864 ≈ (3.9526) * 16.864 ≈ let's calculate that.

3.9526 *16 = 63.2416

3.9526 *0.864 ≈ approx 3.9526 *0.8=3.16208; 3.9526 *0.064≈0.253, so total≈3.415.

So total ≈63.2416 +3.415≈66.656.

Wait, but wait, my calculation of 3.9526 *16.864:

16.864 * 3.9526 ≈ let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 16.864 × 3.9526.

First, 16 × 3.9526 = 63.2416.

0.864 × 3.9526 ≈ 3.415.

So 63.2416 +3.415 =66.6566.

So approximately 66.6566.

But wait, let's double-check the exact sum of the terms.

Let me recompute the individual terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°). Let me compute sin(134 degrees).

sin(134) = sin(180-46)=sin(46)= approx 0.7193. So 3 * 0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 * sin(70)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(0.8660)=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579; +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Now, compute (1/k) * sum.

We have k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

1/k ≈3.9526 fm.

So 3.9526 *16.864 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.9526 *16.864:

Compute 3.9526 × 16 = 63.2416.

3.9526 ×0.864:

Breakdown: 3.9526 ×0.8=3.16208.

3.9526 ×0.06=0.237156.

3.9526 ×0.004=0.0158104.

Adding together: 3.16208 +0.237156=3.399236 +0.0158104≈3.415046.

So total is 63.2416 +3.415046≈66.6566.

So Im[f(0)] ≈66.6566 fm.

But looking at the options, the closest option is A) 87163.4 fm, which is way larger. The others are in the hundreds of fm.

Wait, this can't be right. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 66 fm isn't one of the options. The options are about 177.675, 251.271, etc.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in computing k. Let me go back.

We have E = 50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 ) → p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.9976 → p c ≈50 MeV.

So p ≈50 MeV / c.

Now, k is p / ħ.

But, in terms of units, the issue is how to express p and ħ in compatible units.

Another approach: Use the relation between k and the wavelength. But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of inverse meters and then convert to inverse femtometers.

So, let me compute k as:

k = p / ħ.

But p = 50 MeV / c.

In SI units:

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J.

c ≈3e8 m/s.

So p = (50 MeV) / c = (50 *1.60218e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s).

So p = (8.0109e-12 J) / (3e8 m/s) )= 8.0109e-12 / 3e8 = 2.6703e-20 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = p / ħ = (2.6703e-20 kg·m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s )

J is kg·m²/s², so J·s is kg·m²/s.

Wait, so units: kg·m/s divided by (kg·m²/s) → 1/(m).

So, k = 2.6703e-20 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ (2.6703 / 1.0545718) * 1e14 → approximately 2.531 *1e14 m^{-1}.

So k ≈2.531e14 m^{-1}.

Convert this to inverse femtometers. Since 1 fm =1e-15 m,

1 m = 1e15 fm.

So 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

Thus,

k ≈2.531e14 m^{-1} = 2.531e14 *1e-15 fm^{-1} ) = 2.531e-1 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈0.2531 fm^{-1}.

Which matches my earlier calculation.

So that part is correct. So the Im[f(0)] is approximately 66.6566 fm.

But none of the options are near 66.66 fm.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, none match 66.66. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in assuming the formula for f(0). Maybe the formula is different. Let me re-examine the partial wave expansion.

Wait, the general formula is:

f(theta) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^infty (2l +1) e^{2i delta_l} sin(l theta) P_l (cos theta) ?

Wait, no, the correct expression is f(theta) = (1/k) sum (2l +1) e^{2i delta_l} P_l (cos theta) e^{i l phi}.

But for theta=0, cos theta=1, so P_l(1)=1 for all l, and e^{i l phi}=1 for phi=0 or any phi when l=0, but in general, for the forward direction, phi=0.

So f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l +1) e^{2i delta_l}.

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l +1) sin(2 delta_l).

But according to my earlier calculation, that sum is 16.864, and (1/k)=3.9526 fm, so 3.9526 *16.864≈66.656 fm.

But that's not an option. That suggests I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should include higher phase shifts beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore the rest beyond delta4. So no.

Wait, maybe the phase shifts given are the real parts of the partial wave amplitudes, but in the formula, we have e^{2i delta_l}.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of each term.

Let me recompute each term:

l=0: (2l+1)=1, delta0=90°, 2delta0=180°, sin(180)=0. So term 1*0=0.

l=1: (2l+1)=3, delta1=67°, 2delta1=134°, sin(134)=sin(46)=approx 0.7193. So term 3*0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2: (2l+1)=5, delta2=55°, 2delta2=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397. So 5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: (2l+1)=7, delta3=30°, 2delta3=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. So 7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: (2l+1)=9, delta4=13°, 2delta4=26°, sin(26)=approx 0.4384. So 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = 16.863 approx.

So that's correct.

Then, 1/k is approx 3.9526 fm.

3.9526 *16.863≈66.656 fm.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option B: 355.351, which is about 5 times larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(0) is not (1/k) times the sum, but (1/(k)) times the sum multiplied by something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the amplitude is f = (1/k) sum (2l +1) e^{2i delta_l}.

But the total cross-section sigma_total is given by the integral of |f(theta)|^2 over solid angle, but the question isn't about that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the cross-section is given by |f(0)|^2 * 4 pi, but that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the wave number k. Maybe in the formula, k is in units of inverse meters, but I used inverse femtometers. Let me check.

Wait, no, because when I computed k, I got 0.253 fm^{-1}, which is 1 fm / 0.253 → about 3.95 fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula actually uses the wavevector in a different way. Wait, I think the formula f(theta) is in units of length (fm), because the cross-section is in fm², and |f|^2 is the cross-section multiplied by (k^2) (since |f|^2 = sigma * k^2 /4 pi).

Wait, but perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f has units of length. The differential cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by k^2 (but I'm a bit fuzzy on this).

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum ... ?

No, I think the standard formula is f(theta) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} P_l (cos theta).

Wait, but let me check the units. Each term (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} P_l (cos theta) is dimensionless, since delta_l is phase. So (1/k) times that would have units of length, which makes sense for scattering amplitude.

So I think the formula is correct.

Hmm. So if the calculation gives me about 66.66 fm, but the options are way off, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees? No, no, the question gives the phase shifts in degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2 delta_l in radians.

Let me recalculate each sin(2 delta_l) using radians.

Because earlier, I computed sin(2 delta_l) in degrees, but perhaps I should convert to radians.

Let me compute each term again.

l=0: delta0=90°, 2 delta0=180° → sin(180°)=0.

l=1: delta1=67°, 2 delta1=134°. 134 degrees in radians is (134 * pi)/180 ≈ 2.34 radians. sin(2.34)= approx 0.7193 (same as before).

l=2: delta2=55°, 2 delta2=110° → 110 * pi/180 ≈1.91986 rad. sin(1.91986)= approx 0.9397.

l=3: delta3=30°, 2 delta3=60° → pi/3 radians. sin(pi/3)=√3/2≈0.8660.

l=4: delta4=13°, 2 delta4=26° →26 * pi/180≈0.4537 rad. sin(0.4537)= approx 0.4384.

So the sines are the same as before, because the calculation in degrees and radians gives the same result for the sine function when the angle is in degrees or radians as long as you convert properly. Wait no, that's not correct. Wait, sin(134 degrees) is the same as sin(134 * pi/180) radians.

So the sines are correct as I calculated before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the wave number k is in units of inverse meters, but perhaps I should convert the result to femtometers.

Wait, earlier calculation gave Im(f(0))=66.656 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of k.

E = 50 MeV.

p = sqrt( E^2 - m_e^2 ) / c.

But in natural units (ħ = c =1), E (MeV) and p (MeV/c) are related as p = sqrt(E^2 - m_e^2).

So p ≈50 MeV/c.

k is p / ħ.

But, since ħc ≈197.33 MeV fm, so (ħ c )=197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c )/( ħ c ) = (50 MeV c )/(197.33 MeV fm ) → 50 / 197.33 → approx 0.253 fm^{-1}.

That's correct.

So, Im[f(0)]= (1/k) * sum → 1/0.253 ≈3.9526 fm, multiplied by sum 16.864.

3.9526 *16.864 ≈66.656 fm.

But that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Oh! Wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. The amplitude f(theta) is a complex number, so f(theta) = Re[f] + i Im[f]. The imaginary part is Im[f(theta)].

But in the partial wave expansion, each term is (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} sin(l theta) for l=0,1,2, etc.

Wait, no, earlier I thought that for theta=0, the terms are (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

Wait, perhaps I should express f(theta) as (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ cos(2 delta_l) + i sin(2 delta_l) ].

So f(theta) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) cos(2 delta_l) + i (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l).

Thus, the imaginary part Im[f(theta)] is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l).

Which is what I did.

So, perhaps the calculation is correct, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about the differential cross-section, but the question clearly says it's about the scattering amplitude.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts given are for the partial waves l=0,1,2,3,4, but the formula for f(0) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

But wait, when l=0, the term is (2*0+1)=1, e^{2i delta_0}, which is e^{i pi} because delta_0=90 degrees ×2=180 degrees.

So e^{i pi} = -1. So for l=0, the term is 1 * (-1) = -1.

Wait, wait a minute! Oh no, I think I made a mistake in calculating the phase shifts for l=0.

Because in the earlier calculation, I assumed that each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

But for l=0, delta_0=90°, so 2 delta_0=180°, so e^{i 180°} = -1.

So the term for l=0 is (1)* (-1) = -1.

Wait, but wait, I thought that for l=0, the Legendre polynomial P_0 is 1, so the term is (2*0 +1) e^{2i delta_0} * sin(0 * theta) → but wait, sin(0)=0, so the term is zero. But earlier I thought that f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}, not considering the sin(l theta) term, but that was incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express f(theta):

f(theta) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^infty (2l +1) e^{2i delta_l} P_l ( cos theta )

At theta=0, cos theta=1, and P_l(1)=1 for any l.

So,

f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^infty (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} *1.

So the terms are (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

Thus, for l=0, it is (1) e^{2i delta_0}.

But delta_0=90°, so 2 delta_0=180°, e^{i 180°}= -1.

So for l=0, the term is 1 * (-1) = -1.

Ah! That's what I missed earlier.

So in the sum, the l=0 term is -1, not 0.

So let me recompute the sum with l=0 included.

So, the sum becomes:

l=0: 1 * e^{i180} = -1. So real part is -1, imaginary part is 0.

So the imaginary part for l=0 is 0.

Wait, because e^{i 180} is -1, which has 0 imaginary part.

So, for the other terms (l=1,2,3,4), I'll proceed as before.

So, the sum of the imaginary parts is:

sum = sum_{l=1 to 4} (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Which is:

l=1:3 * sin(134°)=3 * 0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

So sum =2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456=16.863 approx.

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) *16.863.

Which is the same as before, 66.656 fm.

But again, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but wait: the l=0 term's contribution to the imaginary part is zero. So the sum is the same as before.

Thus, I'm back to the same problem: the answer isn't among the options.

Hmm. Maybe I should re-examine the formula for f(theta).

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula is f(theta) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} P_l (cos theta).

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is (1/k) sum, as I've been using.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the scattering angle in the backward direction, but the question specifies the incident beam direction, which is theta=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum.

Let me redo the sum:

l=0: (2l+1)=1, e^{2i delta_l}=e^{i pi}=-1. So real part is -1, imaginary part is 0.

l=1:3 * e^{i 134°}=3 (cos134 +i sin134) → imaginary part 3 sin134≈3*0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * e^{i 110°}=5 (cos110 +i sin110) → imaginary part 5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * e^{i 60°}=7 (0.5 + i 0.8660) → imaginary part 7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * e^{i 26°}=9 (cos26 +i sin26) → imaginary part 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum of imaginary parts: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

Plus l=0's 0 → total sum is 16.864.

So same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is in a different unit.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I computed k as approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

But perhaps I should express k in terms of inverse femtometers using the relation ħc=197.33 MeV fm.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But p =50 MeV/c.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But, since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, then ħ= (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) → (50 /197.33) 1/fm → 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Yes, that's correct.

So, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum → 1/0.253 *16.864 ≈ 66.656 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question.

Wait, looking back, the question states 'ignore rest of the phase shifts.' So, the phase shifts given are up to l=4, but perhaps the formula includes all l from 0 to ∞. But since the given phase shifts are up to l=4, and higher l are ignored, that should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given phase shifts are for the scattering amplitude in the lab frame, but in this case, it's electrons scattering from a nucleus, so perhaps the electrons are treated as coming from a different frame. But I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is actually (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) * cos(2 delta_l), but no, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is f(theta) = sum ( (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} ( sin(l theta) ) / (k l (l+1)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum ... ?

Wait, I'm getting too stuck. Let me think about the given options. Option C is approximately 177.675 fm, which is about twice 88.8, which is about twice my result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck:

l=1: 3 sin(134) ≈3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564.

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184.

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given as the real parts of the partial wave amplitudes, not as the phase shifts multiplied by 2.

Wait, the partial wave amplitude a_l is given by a_l = (1/(2ik)) (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

So, perhaps the given phase shifts are the real parts of a_l.

But the problem states that the phase shifts are δ0, δ1, etc., so I think the formula uses δ_l as the phase shift in e^{2i delta_l}.

Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are the scattering angles, not the phase shifts. No, the question clearly states 'phase shifts'.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) instead of sin(2 delta_l). Let me try that.

If I compute sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l):

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 * approx 0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 * 0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249≈2.024.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.024≈13.3815.

Then, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum → 3.9526 *13.3815≈52.93 fm. Still not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) cos(delta_l). That would give a different result, but it's not the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using sin(delta_l), not sin(2 delta_l).

Wait, but in the formula, the imaginary part comes from sin(2 delta_l), as per the expansion of e^{2i delta_l}.

So I think I'm correct in using sin(2 delta_l).

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are the scattering angles, not the phase shifts. But the question says phase shifts.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the options are given, I must have misunderstood the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(theta) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} ), not e^{2i delta_l}.

In that case, the imaginary part would be sum ( (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ), and the calculation would be as follows:

sum = 1 * sin(90) +3 sin(67)+5 sin(55)+7 sin(30)+9 sin(13).

Compute each term:

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.2249≈2.024.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.024≈13.3815.

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * 13.3815 ≈3.9526 *13.3815≈52.93 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum ( (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} ), without the 2.

But then Im[f(0)] would be sum ( (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) as above.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses e^{i delta_l}, and the sum is multiplied by (1/(2k)).

Wait, I'm getting more confused. I think I'll have to go with my initial calculation, but it's not matching the options.

Wait, another approach: calculate the sum without l=0.

Because when I first thought about f(0), I thought that the l=0 term is zero because sin(0)=0, but in reality, when expanded, the formula for f(0) includes all l terms because P_l(1)=1 for all l.

So, perhaps I should include l=0 correctly.

But I did include l=0 in the sum, and it contributes -1 in the real part but 0 in the imaginary part.

So including l=0 doesn't change the sum for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (1/(2k)) instead of (1/k).

Let me try that.

With (1/(2k)) * 16.864 = (0.5 /0.253 ) *16.864 ≈1.976 *16.864≈33.328 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is f(theta) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(l theta) ) )

But that doesn't make sense because the phase shift is in the exponential.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the sum as (2l+1) * sin( delta_l ), but that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should pick the closest option, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts given are in radians, not degrees. Let me try that.

So, delta0=90 degrees = pi/2 radians.

So 2 delta0=pi radians → sin(pi)=0.

But for the others:

l=1: delta1=67 degrees →67 * pi/180= approx1.169 rad.

2 delta1=2.338 rad → sin(2.338)≈0.7193.

Same as before.

Similarly, others are the same, so the sum remains 16.864.

No change.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute k differently.

E=50 MeV.

We can compute the wavelength lambda as lambda = h / p.

But p=gamma m v.

But perhaps it's easier to compute k= (2pi)/lambda.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: Use the relation between the momentum and the wavelength.

p = h / lambda → lambda = h /p.

But in terms of energy, E = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 ).

But perhaps I can compute the de Broglie wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. I think my initial calculation of k is correct.

So I'm stuck, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 is approximately 2.66 times my calculated value of 66.656.

Hmm. 2.66 is about 8/3, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (2l+1) multiplied by 2, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i delta_l} ), which would change the sum, but I don't think that's correct.

At this point, I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't find an error in my calculation. So I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the sum again.

Let me recalculate each term:

l=0: (2l+1)=1. sin(2 delta0)=sin(180)=0 → contribution 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134) =3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the wave number k is given as 0.253 fm^{-1}, but the formula requires 1/k to be in inverse fm, which would be 3.9526 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no, because 1/k is 1/(0.253 fm^{-1}) )=3.9526 fm.

So, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum = 3.9526 fm *16.864=66.656 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) instead of (1/k), which would give 33.328 fm, but that's not among the options.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C: 177.675 fm. Which is approximately 2.66 times larger than my result.

But I don't see where I could have missed a factor of about 2.66. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of k.

p =50 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ.

But in terms of units, ħc=197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ=197.33 MeV fm / c.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )) = (50 /197.33) (1 fm^{-1} )=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the optical theorem.

The optical theorem states that Im f(0) = (k/(4 pi)) sigma_total.

But I don't have sigma_total. So perhaps the problem expects to use (k/(4 pi)) sigma_total, but without sigma_total, that's impossible.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since the calculated value isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, but I can't see where.

Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C: 177.675 fm, because it's the closest to twice 88.8, which is about twice my initial sum of 16.864, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts were to be summed without the 2 multiplier, but that would give a different result.

But I'm stuck. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), for elastic scattering of \( 50~\text{MeV} \) electrons from a nuclear target. The scattering amplitude is expressed using partial wave analysis, where the phase shifts \( \delta_l \) are given for \( l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). The formula for \( f(0) \) is:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{2i\delta_l},
\]

and the imaginary part is:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number \( k \):**  
   The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation for momentum \( p \), where \( p = \sqrt{E^2 - m_e^2} \). Given \( E = 50~\text{MeV} \) and \( m_e c^2 = 0.511~\text{MeV} \), \( p \) is approximately \( 50~\text{MeV}/c \). Using \( \hbar c = 197.33~\text{MeV·fm} \), \( k \) is found to be:

   \[
   k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253~\text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Imaginary Part Calculation:**  
   The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is computed as:

   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l),
   \]

   where the phase shifts are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The sine terms are calculated as follows:
   - \( l = 0: \sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
   - \( l = 1: \sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \),
   - \( l = 2: \sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \),
   - \( l = 3: \sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \),
   - \( l = 4: \sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \).

   The contributions to the sum are:
   - \( l = 0: 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \),
   - \( l = 1: 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \),
   - \( l = 2: 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \),
   - \( l = 3: 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \),
   - \( l = 4: 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

   Summing these gives:

   \[
   \sum (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864.
   \]

   Substituting into the formula for \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \):

   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{0.253} \cdot 16.864 \approx 66.656~\text{fm}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The calculated value \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 66.656~\text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately \( 2.66 \) times larger than the computed result. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or the options provided.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated result and the options, and assuming the problem intends for one of the provided answers to be correct, the most plausible choice is:

**Answer: C**
