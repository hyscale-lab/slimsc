Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what information I can gather.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and from that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to outline the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm, okay. So each step gives a clue about the compounds involved. Let's see if I can figure out what each substance could be.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Solid A reacting with gas B. Maybe A is an element or a simple compound, and B is something that can react in a multiple ratio. Let me think of elements that react in such a way. Maybe A is sulfur (S), and B is oxygen (O2)? Because, for example, forming SO3 would require 3 O2, but that's 6 O atoms. Wait, in sulfur trioxide, the formula is SO3, but that would require 3 O atoms, so maybe 3/2 O2 molecules. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another thought. What if A is a metal and B is something like chlorine? But the product C is bright red. Oh, wait! Lead nitrate is bright yellow, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2? Let me think: sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. But the ratio here is 8 equivalents of B. Sodium has a valency of 1, Cl2 is diatomic. So, Na + Cl2 → NaCl. The stoichiometry would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So for 8 equivalents of Cl2, sodium would need 16 equivalents. Hmm, but the problem states 8 equivalents of B. Maybe I'm not on the right track.

Let me think of other possibilities. What about a reaction where A is a metal oxide? Wait, solid A reacting with gas B. Another approach: perhaps A is a metal sulfide. But that's a bit vague.

Wait, let's consider reaction 3: C reacts with water to give A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, perhaps when C is treated with water, it hydrolyzes into A and two acids. One strong and one weak. So, what compounds, upon hydrolysis, produce two different acids?

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt? Or a sulfate? Alternatively, if C is a sulfate ester or something else.

Wait, another angle: when a compound reacts with water to produce two acids, perhaps it's an acid anhydride. For instance, when a mixed anhydride is hydrolyzed, it can produce two different acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, suppose C is sodium nitrite reacting with water. No, that might not produce two acids. Alternatively, think of something like (NH4)2Cr2O7. When it reacts with water, it can decompose to produce HCrO3 (chromic acid) and NH4OH (which is weak, but ammonium hydroxide isn't a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe it's more like a sulfonate ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Wait, but when nitro compounds react with water, they don't usually produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If C is a sulfonic acid anhydride? Or perhaps, looking at reaction 3: when C reacts with water, it produces A plus two acids F and G. So A is a solid, perhaps a metal, and F and G are acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, if C is Na2SO4 (sodium sulfate), but when it reacts with water, it would just dissolve into ions, not form acids. Unless... Wait, maybe C is something like (NH4)2Cr2O7 (ammonium dichromate). When this reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into H2Cr2O7 and NH4OH. H2Cr2O7 is a strong acid (it's a strong oxidizing agent, though), and NH4OH is a weak acid. So that would fit: F is strong (H2Cr2O7), G is weak (NH4OH). That's possible.

If that's the case, then A would be NH4 (but that's not a solid). Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe C is something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite salt. For example, Na2SO3. But when it reacts with water, it's just soluble. Hmm, maybe it's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is Pb(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Pb^2+ and NO3^-; that doesn't produce acids. So perhaps not.

Another angle: looking at reaction 4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. What are common gas solvents? Hmm, H could be something like H2O (water), but that's a liquid. Or maybe H is something like ethanol or something else. Wait, but B and D are gases. So D and B are both gases, and when they react 1:1, they form H, which is a solvent.

So, what gases when reacting 1:1 produce a solvent? Let me think: CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's a weak acid, not a solvent. Alternatively, what about NH3 and HCl? They react 1:1 to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe H is ethanol, but D and B would need to be something like ethylene and water, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe D is carbon dioxide and B is something else. Hmm. Or perhaps D is H2O, but B is O2. No, doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about common solvents. H is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Let's think about H being H2O. But then, D and B would react to form H2O. So D + B → H2O. But D and B are both gases. So what two gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form water? H2 and O2, but in a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, NH3 and HCl, but that would form NH4Cl, which is solid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is ammonia (NH3), which is a gas but can be a solvent in some contexts. Wait, but ammonia is a gas under standard conditions, though it can be a liquid under pressure. Alternatively, maybe H is something else.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. But D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but perhaps that's too obscure.

Alternatively, if E is something like phosgene (but that's COCl2), which is a gas and toxic. Or maybe something like chlorine trifluoride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the main thing is to find E's molecular symmetry group. So perhaps I should figure out what E is first.

Let me try to tackle this systematically.

Starting with reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

Possible gas reactions:

- Nitrogen (N2) and Hydrogen (H2) → NH3 (but that's 1:3 ratio). So that doesn't fit.

- O2 and another diatomic gas? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is CO2, and B is H2O. No, H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, D is H2O (gas?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if B is O2 and D is H2S. But O2 and H2S react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O and S. So 2 H2S + O2 → 2 H2O + S. That's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O. So D + B → H2O. So what two gases react in 1:1 to form water? Let's see: H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is solid. So that's not a solvent.

Wait, maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is SO3 and B is H2O. So, SO3 (gas) + H2O → H2SO4 (liquid). But in that case, SO3 and H2O would produce sulfuric acid, which is a liquid, but H is supposed to be a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas that reacts with O2 to form a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and B is H2O. But Cl2 and H2O don't react in 1:1 to form a solvent. Hmm.

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should look at another reaction first.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red). So the product is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like mercury(I) oxide (HgO) is red, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's lead dioxide (PbO2) which is dark brown. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like CuO which is black. Hmm.

Wait, another bright red solid I remember is lead(II,IV) oxide (Pb3O4), which is a reddish solid. Or maybe it's Fe(OH)3, but that's more of a reddish-brown precipitate. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate salt. Wait, sodium nitrate is white, but maybe another nitrate is bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, CdS is bright yellow. PbS is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is a chromate or dichromate. Sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7) is orange-red. Alternatively, potassium dichromate is also orange-red. But is that bright red? It's more of an orange color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is mercuric oxide, which is red. HgO is red. If that's the case, then A + 8 B → HgO.

But HgO is formed from Hg and O2. The reaction is 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So for 8 equivalents of O2, you would need 16 Hg atoms. That seems a bit off. Let me think about the stoichiometry here.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur and B is oxygen. The reaction would be S + O2 → SO3? No, because that's not correct. Sulfur burns in oxygen to form SO2 or SO3, but SO3 is a liquid or solid? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is O2. Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Fe3O4 is a black solid. Fe2O3 is reddish. So if C is Fe2O3, which is reddish, that could fit the bright red description.

So if A is Fe, B is O2, then C is Fe2O3.

Let me check the stoichiometry. The reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So, the ratio of Fe to O2 is 4:3. If the problem states 8 equivalents of O2, then Fe would be (4/3)*8 = 32/3 ≈ 10.666 equivalents. That might not fit neatly, but maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 FeO3? No, that's not the correct formula. FeO3 isn't a common oxide; usually, it's FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is PbO2, which is dark brown. Not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, nitrobenzene is a red-brown liquid, but it's not a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonamide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach. Let's consider reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A and two acids. So C is probably a salt that, when hydrolyzed, releases a strong and a weak acid.

Wait, let's think of a salt like sodium sulfite. Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form HSO3^- and OH^-? Not sure. Alternatively, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) wouldn't produce acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfamic acid derivative or another compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 and NH3. But that would produce a strong base (Ca(OH)2 is not strong) and NH3, which is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is sodium selenate or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfate ester. For example, (NH4)2SO4 (ammonium sulfate) when hydrolyzed in water would produce NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (a strong acid). That fits the description: F is strong (H2SO4), G is weak (NH4OH). So that would mean, in reaction 3, C is (NH4)2SO4. Then, when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into 2 NH4^+ and SO4^2-. But wait, no, it's more accurate to say that ammonium sulfate is a salt that, when dissolved in water, produces ammonium ions (NH4^+) and sulfate ions (SO4^2-). But in this case, the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G.

So, if (NH4)2SO4 + H2O → 2 NH4OH + H2SO4. But wait, that doesn't balance. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps when (NH4)2SO4 is heated, it decomposes. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I got the salts wrong.

Wait, another possibility: C is (NH4)2Cr2O7. When it's heated, it can decompose into K2Cr2O7 and other products, but I'm not sure about hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps C is sodium chromate. Na2CrO4. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze to form Cr(OH)O4 and NaOH. Hmm, not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, but upon hydrolysis, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids include H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc. Weak acids include CH3COOH, HCN (but that's weak), NH4OH (which is a weak base, actually). Wait, so in the case of (NH4)2Cr2O7 hydrolyzing, perhaps it forms H2CrO4 (strong acid) and NH4OH (weak base). But the problem says two acids, F and G. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the two products are both acids. So when C hydrolyzes, it produces two different acids. So for example, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it could form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and another acid. Hmm, but I don't see another acid, unless it's something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate, like NaHCO3, but that's not a solid that would react with water to form two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like RSO3-O-R', then hydrolysis would yield two sulfonic acids. But I'm not certain about that.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to focus on other parts of the problem.

Looking back at reaction 4: D and B react 1:1 to form H, a solvent. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's H2O. But then D and B would have to be gases that react to form H2O. What gases react 1:1 to form H2O? Hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe D is CO and B is H2O. But CO is a gas, and H2O is a liquid. Hmm.

Wait another thought: maybe H is alcohol, like ethanol. But ethanol is a liquid at room temperature. Alternatively, maybe H is methanol. But then, D and B would have to be gases that react to form methanol. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, and D is H2O and B is O2. But that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O (as a gas, steam) and B is O2. But combining them would not directly form H2O again.

Wait, maybe D is HCl and B is NH3. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. But the problem states H is a solvent, which would require it to be a liquid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm focusing too much on this part. Let's try another approach.

Looking at reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's something like phosgene (COCl2), mustard gas, sarin, or something similar. But what's the structure of E?

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound, like ozone (O3), but that's a gas, and not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another thought: if D is Cl2 and C is something like SO2, then their reaction could form something like SOCl2, which is a toxic liquid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small quantities.

Wait, but E is formed when C reacts with D. So if C is a chromate or dichromate salt, maybe reacting with Cl2 (D) could produce something like CrCl3. But I'm not sure about the reactivity or the hazard level.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I'm not sure how that would form from C and D.

Alternatively, maybe E is chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), which is a highly reactive and dangerous gas. But I don't know the reaction conditions.

Hmm, but perhaps I should think about E's structure. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

So, I need to figure out what E is and then determine its symmetry group.

Let me think about some molecules and their symmetry groups.

- O2: D∞h symmetry.
- CO2: D4h symmetry (linear molecule with two double bonds).
- H2O: D2h symmetry, but maybe C2v if considering only the molecule itself.
- Cl2: D∞h symmetry.
- SO2: C2v symmetry (bent molecule).
- O3: D3h symmetry.
- CH3Cl: C2 symmetry if it's a planar molecule but actually, CH3Cl has Cs symmetry as it's not symmetrical.
- SF6: Oh symmetry (octahedral), but that's not one of the options.
- H2S: C2v symmetry.
- NH3: Trigonal pyramidal, so C3v symmetry.
- PH3: Same as NH3.
- ClF3: Trigonal pyramidal, so C3v symmetry.
- SO3: D3h symmetry (planar trigonal).
- ICl: C2 symmetry. Wait, no, ICl is linear, so D∞h.

Wait, but let me look up some common molecules and their symmetry groups.

Wait, maybe E is something like phosgene (COCl2). The structure of phosgene is a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms (double bonds) and two chlorine atoms. So the molecular geometry is tetrahedral? No, wait, carbon is in the center with double bonds to O. So the structure is O=C=O with two Cl atoms attached? No, wait, phosgene is (Cl)2C=O? No, no. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. So the molecule is linear, with the structure Cl2C=O. Wait, no, that's not correct. Phosgene is actually O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule with two chlorine atoms and one oxygen double-bonded to the central carbon. So the structure is trigonal planar.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Phosgene is (Cl)2C=O, which is a planar molecule. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the geometry is trigonal planar. The symmetry group would be D∞h if it's linear, but wait, phosgene is planar trigonal, which would have D3h symmetry. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, another possibility: E could be something like SO2, which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. Or perhaps something like O3, which has D3h symmetry.

Alternatively, E could be a diatomic molecule. Cl2 is D∞h, O2 is D∞h, HCl is Cs. But E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a diatomic like Cl2 (but Cl2 isn't that hazardous unless in high concentrations).

Wait, but the problem says that E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So E's structure depends on what C and D are.

Let me try to think of C as (NH4)2Cr2O7. If reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. Suppose D is H2S. Then, (NH4)2Cr2O7 + H2S → ? But I'm not sure about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt, and D is something like H2S. Then, the reaction could produce HNO3 and another product. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about reaction 4 again. D and B react 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. If H is NH3, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O. But how can D and B form H2O in a 1:1 ratio?

Wait, another approach: Let's think about D. Since D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent, perhaps D is a gas that is a diatomic molecule, like O2, N2, Cl2, etc.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas that reacts 1:1 with O2 to form a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O (gas?), and D is something else. Not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry groups of the options. The options are:

A) C2: which implies a twofold rotation axis, with perhaps a mirror plane. Molecules like H2O (if we consider only the O atom and two H atoms, but H2O has C2v symmetry. So maybe not.)

Wait, no. Wait, H2O has a structure with two H atoms and an O atom in a bent shape. Its point group is C2v, which is option D. So if E were H2O, the symmetry group would be C2v. But the question says E is extremely hazardous, so H2O is not likely.

Option B is D4h. That's a high symmetry group, typically for linear molecules with inversion and multiple planes, like CO2, which is linear with D4h symmetry. So if E were CO2, symmetry group D4h.

Option C is D∞h, which applies to linear molecules with infinite symmetry, like O2, H2, Cl2, etc.

Option D is C2v, which applies to bent molecules like H2O, SO2, etc.

So, given E's structure, what could it be? Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a gas like phosgene (which has C2v symmetry?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule. The structure is trigonal planar, so the point group is D3h. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, so the point group is C3v. Not in the options.

Another possibility: E is O3, ozone. Ozone is a bent molecule with D3h symmetry. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2. O2 is D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is also D∞h. But these are quite common and not extremely hazardous, though they can be harmful in high concentrations.

Wait, but the problem states that E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a compound like sarin gas, which has a more complex structure. But sarin's structure is more complicated, and I'm not sure of its symmetry group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry. For example, CO2 has D4h symmetry. But CO2 is a gas, but not extremely hazardous. Unless in high concentrations, but it's not the most dangerous.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps E is SO2. SO2 is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry (option D). It's a toxic gas. So if E is SO2, then the symmetry group would be C2v.

So, let's tie this together. If E is SO2, what would the reactions look like?

Let me reevaluate the earlier steps with this assumption.

Assume E is SO2.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → SO2.

So, what would C and D be? Let's think.

If E is SO2, perhaps D is H2S and C is something that reacts with H2S to produce SO2.

But H2S + something → SO2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite and D is H2O. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about reaction 4. D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent.

If H is H2O, then D + B → H2O.

If D is H2S and B is O2, then 2 H2S + O2 → 2 H2O + S. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O (if it's a gas, like steam) and B is another gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O. Then, O2 + H2O → H2O? That doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. So D and B would react to form NH3. For example, D could be NH3 and B is HCl. But that would require a 1:1 ratio, producing NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is N2 and D is H2, but they don't react in 1:1 to form a solvent.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should make some assumptions and see if they fit.

Assume:

- C is (NH4)2Cr2O7. Then, reaction 3: C + H2O → 2 NH4OH + H2CrO4.

But wait, H2CrO4 is a strong acid. So F is H2CrO4, G is NH4OH (which is a weak acid, but actually a weak base. Hmm, maybe I'm off here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Na2SO3. Then, hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But the problem says two acids, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH and H2CO3. But H2CO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. But again, the problem states two acids, so that doesn't fit.

Another approach: Perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is (RO)SO3-O-R', then hydrolysis would yield two sulfonic acids. But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, but upon hydrolysis, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For example, MgCl2. When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Mg^2+ and Cl^- ions. No, that's not forming acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2. But H2O2 is a liquid, not a solid. So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should look at the possible E molecules and their symmetry groups.

Given the options, if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2, the structure is trigonal planar, so D3h symmetry, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if E is ClF3, which has a trigonal pyramidal shape, C3v symmetry, not an option.

Alternatively, E is H2O, which is C2v, but H2O isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts.

Alternatively, E is O3, which has D3h symmetry. But O3 is a bent molecule with three atoms. Its symmetry group is D3h, which isn't among the options.

Wait, another molecule: HCN has a linear structure, so D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas. So if E is HCN, then the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But would that fit the reaction conditions?

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → HCN.

So, C is a compound that, when reacted with 2 equivalents of D, produces HCN.

But I'm not sure about the other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is COCl2 (phosgene), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure of O=C(Cl)2, which is planar trigonal, so D3h symmetry. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of E as O2, which is D∞h symmetry. But O2 isn't extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations. The problem states E is extremely hazardous, so maybe that's not it.

Another thought: E could be a molecule like Cl2, which is D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a toxic gas, so that fits.

So, if E is Cl2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → Cl2.

But I'm not sure what C and D could be.

Wait, but let's think about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

If D is H2O (a gas, steam) and B is Cl2, then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So H is H2O, which is a solvent. But the ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2, which is 2:1, not 1:1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H would be HCl, which is a gas. Not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, D and B would be gases that react 1:1 to form NH3. For example, D could be H2 and B could be N2, but they don't react. Alternatively, D is NH3 and B is HCl. But that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid. Hmm.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the possible answers. The options are symmetry groups, which are determined by the structure of E.

If I can't figure out E's structure, perhaps I can think about the other parts.

In reaction 3, C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.

If F is H2SO4, then C might be something like (NH4)2SO4. So when (NH4)2SO4 reacts with water, it would give NH4OH and H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid. NH4OH is a weak acid (though it's more accurately a weak base). Hmm, but perhaps it's a typo, and G is a weak base. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to say that G is a weak base, but it's written as an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, (NH4)2Cr2O7. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form H2CrO4 (strong acid) and NH4OH (weak base). But the question states two acids, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate salt. For example, (NH4)3PO4. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form H3PO4 (weak acid) and NH4OH (weak base). Again, not two acids.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

If I had to choose between the options, and considering that E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's SO2, which has C2v symmetry. Or perhaps Cl2, which is D∞h.

But the options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If E is SO2, the symmetry group is C2v (option D). If E is Cl2, it's D∞h (option C).

But which one is more likely? SO2 is a toxic gas, and Cl2 is also toxic. The problem says E is extremely hazardous. Both fit, but which would have a symmetry group among the options.

Alternatively, another possibility: E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which is a highly toxic gas. Its structure is trigonal planar, so D3h symmetry. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: what if E is something like CH3Cl (methyl chloride), which is a solvent and toxic. But CH3Cl has a Cs symmetry, not any of the options provided.

Wait, perhaps E is something like HCl gas. But HCl is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. But HCl is not extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry, like CO2. But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous.

Wait, another possibility: E is a molecule like SO3, which has D3h symmetry, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe E is H2O, which is C2v (option D), but H2O isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with C2 symmetry, like H2O (which has C2v symmetry, so that's not C2). Wait, no, H2O has C2v.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another angle. Let's think about the symmetry groups:

- D∞h: applies to linear molecules with an infinite number of symmetry planes perpendicular to the axis. Examples: O2, Cl2, H2.

- D4h: applies to molecules like CO2 (linear), which has a center of inversion and multiple planes and axes.

- C2v: applies to molecules like H2O (bent), with a C2 axis and two mirror planes.

- C2: a simple twofold rotation axis, perhaps in a molecule like ethylene (but ethylene has D2h symmetry).

Hmm, perhaps E is O3, which has D3h symmetry. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has C2v symmetry (option D). SO2 is a toxic gas, and its structure is bent. That would fit.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is D∞h symmetry (option C), but I'm not sure if that's correct given the other reactions.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. Based on the reactions, if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, the answer is C.

But given the reaction conditions, I'm more inclined to think that E is SO2. Because, in reaction 3, if C is a sulfate salt, then reaction with water would give H2SO4, which is a strong acid.

So, putting it all together, perhaps E is SO2, with C2v symmetry (option D).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like Fe₂O₃ (reddish) or a chromate/dichromate salt (orange-red). However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. The extreme hazard of E suggests it could be a toxic gas like SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), Cl₂ (chlorine), or phosgene (COCl₂). These are all toxic, but their structures and symmetry groups differ.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to form acids. For example, if C is ammonium sulfate ((NH₄)₂SO₄), hydrolysis would yield H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and NH₄OH (weak acid). This supports the idea that C is a sulfate salt.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. This suggests D and B could be gases that react to form a liquid solvent like H₂O or NH₃. However, the exact identity of D and B remains uncertain.

### Key Considerations for E:
- If E is SO₂, it is a bent molecule with C₂v symmetry. SO₂ is a toxic gas, fitting the description of being extremely hazardous.
- If E is Cl₂, it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. Cl₂ is also toxic, but the problem emphasizes a specific molecular symmetry group, and SO₂ aligns better with the given options.
- Other possibilities, like phosgene (COCl₂), have trigonal planar geometry (D₃h symmetry), but this is not among the options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reactions and the options provided, the most plausible identity for E is SO₂, which has **C₂v symmetry**. This aligns with the description of E as extremely hazardous and fits the molecular symmetry group options.
