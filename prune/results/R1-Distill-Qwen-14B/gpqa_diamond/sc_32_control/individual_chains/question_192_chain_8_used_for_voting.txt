Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complicated, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, let me read the question again. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, and l is the distance from the center of the cavity. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

So, I need to find the magnitude of E at this point P.

Hmm, I remember that when you have charges inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor here was initially uncharged. Then, when +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's charges respond.

Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges will move. Since it's uncharged initially, when you place +q inside, the conductor must have induced charges. But because the conductor itself is neutral, the induced charges would be such that the conductor's total charge remains zero. So, I think the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the +q charge would attract negative charges to the inner surface. And then, the outer surface must have +q to balance it, since the conductor was neutral. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor was neutral, so putting +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to have -q, leaving the outer surface with +q. Because the total must be zero. So inner surface: -q, outer surface: +q.

Wait, but wait. The cavity is not at the center. Oh right, the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge +q is placed inside a cavity that's off-center. So how does that affect the induced charges?

I think the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge distribution. Since the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge isn't symmetric. But when you're looking at a point outside the conductor, I think the electric field due to the induced charges on the conductor's outer surface can be treated as if all the charge were at the center. Because for points outside the conductor, the induced charges on the outer surface would create a field as if the charge was a point charge at the center. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Because the conductor was initially neutral, and the inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q so the total is zero.

Wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero. The +q is inside the cavity, so the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So conductor's charge: inner (-q), outer (+q). So the total is (-q + q) = 0. Okay.

So, when I'm outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the charges on the outer surface. Since the outer surface is a conductor, the charges are on the outer sphere, so for any point outside, the field looks like it's from a point charge at the center. So the field at P would be as if a charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. The charge q is inside a cavity. So in the cavity, the configuration is a bit different. But because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface are symmetric regardless of where the cavity is. So from outside, it's as if the charge q is at the center of the conductor.

But wait, in this problem, the cavity is off-center. So would the induced charges on the inner surface be symmetric? Let me think. The inner surface has a charge of -q in total. But the distribution on the inner surface would depend on the position of +q inside the cavity. If the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, then the +q is located at a point inside the cavity. So the inner surface would have an induced charge distribution, but from the outside, the outer surface has a symmetric distribution of +q.

Wait, I think that regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity (as long as it's inside), the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform because the conductor is spherical. So if I'm looking from outside, the electric field due to the outer surface would be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So when I place a point P outside the conductor, the field at P is as if there's a charge q at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But the charge in the cavity is not at the center of the conductor, it's at a distance s away. So how does that affect the field outside?

Wait, no, because the field outside is due to the outer surface's charge, which is symmetric and centered at the conductor's center. So the position of the inner charge within the cavity doesn't affect the external field. The external field is the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but no, the inner charge is placed somewhere inside the cavity, which is off-center. But how does that influence the external field? Because the outer surface's charge distribution is due to the inner charge's presence. Wait, but when the inner charge is placed asymmetrically within the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge distribution that's asymmetric, but the outer surface's charge will adjust so that the overall charge outside is +q. So the field outside is as if you have a point charge at the center.

Hmm, but wait, maybe not? Because the point P is at a certain position relative to the center of the cavity. Because the problem gives l, the distance from P to the center of the cavity. And the angle between l and s is theta.

So, perhaps I need to consider the electric field due to the charge q as a point located at a certain position relative to P.

Wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field at P is due to this charge. The position of the +q on the outer surface is effectively at the center of the conductor. So the distance from the charge to P is L, which is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The conductor is a sphere of radius R, and the point P is outside, at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The charge in the cavity is inside, but the outer surface's charge is +q, which is distributed symmetrically around the conductor's center. So the electric field at P due to the outer surface is as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So the field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, that would correspond to option B, which is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². But looking at the options, option B is that.

Wait, but why is the position of the cavity's center affecting the field? Because the charge q is inside, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere. So the field outside is only due to the outer charge, which is symmetrically placed, so it doesn't matter where the inner charge is located. The outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more complicated because the point P is at position l relative to the center of the cavity. Hmm.

Wait, the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the position of P relative to the conductor's center is related to l and s and theta.

Wait, let me visualize this. The conductor's center is O, the cavity's center is O', which is a distance s from O. The point P is a distance l from O', and the angle between l and s is theta. So the distance between O and P can be found using the law of cosines. If the vector from O to O' is s, and the vector from O' to P is l, then the vector from O to P is s + l*cos(theta), but that's in terms of vectors.

Wait, no. Think of O as the origin. O' is at (s, 0, 0), assuming s is along the x-axis. Then, P is a point whose position vector from O' is l in some direction, making an angle theta with the x-axis. So the position vector of P relative to O is O' plus the vector from O' to P.

Let me model this. O is at (0,0,0). O' is at (s, 0, 0). The point P is at a position relative to O' as l in some direction. Let's say, in polar coordinates, with l as the radial distance, angle theta with the x-axis, and phi angle in the y-z plane. So the position vector of P relative to O is (s + l cos(theta), l sin(theta) cos(phi), l sin(theta) sin(phi)).

The distance from O to P is L. So L² = (s + l cos(theta))² + (l sin(theta) cos(phi))² + (l sin(theta) sin(phi))².

Simplify: L² = s² + 2 s l cos(theta) + l² cos²(theta) + l² sin²(theta)(cos²(phi) + sin²(phi)).

Since cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) is 1, this becomes L² = s² + 2 s l cos(theta) + l² [cos²(theta) + sin²(theta)].

Which simplifies to L² = s² + 2 s l cos(theta) + l² (since cos² + sin² = 1).

But wait, that's the same as L² = s² + l² + 2 s l cos(theta). Which is the law of cosines, which makes sense because the points O, O', and P form a triangle where OO' is s, O'P is l, and OP is L.

But I'm trying to relate this to the electric field. The conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, which is distributed spherically symmetrically. So the field at P is as if the charge were at O.

So the electric field E at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the charge is at the center, and P is a distance L from the center.

Wait, but why does the position of the cavity's center (O') matter? Because the charge q is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface charge is symmetric. So the field outside depends only on the outer charge, which is at the center.

So in that case, the magnitude of E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

Wait, but wait a second. What if the cavity's position affects the outer charge distribution? No, I think the outer charge distribution is due to the inner charge, but regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the outer surface charge must be symmetric because the conductor is spherical. Because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charges would cause the outer surface to have a uniform distribution, but only if the conductor itself is a sphere. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the symmetry of the outer surface.

So, yeah, the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let's think about another possibility. Suppose the charge q is inside the cavity, which is not at the center. Would that affect the field outside in any way? No, because the outer shell's charge is symmetric. So the field outside is determined by the outer shell's charge, which is a symmetric distribution of +q. So the field at any point outside is like a point charge at the center.

Thus, the electric field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Conductor and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor becomes induced with a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral overall, must then have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field due to the charges on the outer surface can be treated as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is a result of the spherical symmetry of the conductor's outer surface, which ensures that the electric field outside depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, $+q$, and not on the distribution of the inner charges.

3. **Distance and Electric Field**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Since the electric field outside the conductor is due to the charge $+q$ at the center, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Cavity Position**: The position of the cavity's center (separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center) and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface charge distribution remains symmetric, and the field at $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field outside the conductor is correctly given by $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$ is correct for a point charge, it does not account for the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
