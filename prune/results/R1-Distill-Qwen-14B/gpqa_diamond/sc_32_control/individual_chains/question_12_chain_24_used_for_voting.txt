Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh right, so a pion is decaying into a muon and a neutrino. And it says the pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos are really light, but I think in these kinds of problems, their rest mass is considered negligible. So for calculation purposes, maybe we can take the neutrino's mass as zero. That should simplify things.

The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So that would be the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino, I suppose. Or is it? Wait, the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. So the products are the muon and the neutrino. But neutrinos are leptons, so I guess they have kinetic energy too. But since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its energy would almost entirely be kinetic. But maybe in this problem, they're only asking about the muon's kinetic energy. Hmm, the question says "KE of product particles" which is plural, so I think both. Oh wait, but the options are pairs of numbers, each presumably the KE of each product. So each option has two numbers, like option A is (2.84, 26.8), so probably the first is the muon's KE and the second the neutrino's KE.

Wait, but the neutrino is a particle with negligible mass, so its kinetic energy would be equal to its total energy. But the muon would have both KE and rest mass energy. So maybe I should think about the conservation of energy and momentum here.

Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

So the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p. 

Now, for conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c². After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. So:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
m_pi c² = (gamma m_mu c²) + (p c)

Because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) for relativistic particles, but for the muon, E_mu = gamma m_mu c², and p = gamma m_mu v. Wait, but perhaps using energy and momentum conservation would be better.

Let me write down the equations:

1. Conservation of momentum: p_mu + p_nu = 0 → p_mu = -p_nu.

But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, p_nu ≈ E_nu / c. Because for a massless particle, E = pc. So for the neutrino, E_nu = |p_nu| c.

But for the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. 

So substituting p_mu = -p_nu (in magnitude, same direction but opposite signs), but I think I can just take magnitudes and directions into account.

So:

p_mu = -p_nu → |p_mu| = |p_nu|

But p_nu = E_nu / c → |p_mu| = E_nu / c.

So substituting into E_mu:

E_mu² = ( (E_nu / c) * c )^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 → E_mu² = E_nu^2 + (m_mu c²)^2.

But also, the total energy is conserved:

E_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

Wait, no: E_pi = m_pi c², and E_mu + E_nu = (gamma m_mu c²) + (E_nu). So:

m_pi c² = gamma m_mu c² + E_nu.

But I can write E_mu as sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), which is sqrt( (E_nu^2 / c² * c²) + (m_mu c²)^2 ), so E_mu = sqrt( E_nu^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

Wait, let me try to write the equations again. Let me express all energies in units of MeV, so masses are in MeV/c², and c is set to 1 in these units.

So, E_pi = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ), since E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) → in units where c=1, E = sqrt( p² + m² ). Similarly, E_nu = p_nu, since m_nu=0.

From momentum conservation: p_mu = - p_nu → p_mu = -E_nu.

So, |p_mu| = E_nu.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (m_mu)^2 ) → E_mu^2 = E_nu^2 + m_mu^2.

Conservation of energy:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

So substituting E_mu from the first equation:

E_pi = sqrt( E_nu^2 + m_mu^2 ) + E_nu.

Let me denote x = E_nu for simplicity.

So:

139.6 = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

Hmm, that's the equation I need to solve for x.

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expand the right-hand side: (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 x + x^2.

So:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 *139.6 x.

Calculate numbers:

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7 → let me compute 100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49. So 105.7^2 ≈ 11172.49 MeV².

139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (140-0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So putting that into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 *139.6 x.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

0 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 - 2 *139.6 x.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: let's see, 19488 - 11172 = 8316, 0.16 -0.49 = -0.33 → 8315.67 -0.33=8315.34? Wait wait:

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So equation becomes:

8315.67 = 2 *139.6 x.

Multiply 2 *139.6 → 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Calculating that: 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is more than 8315.67. So 29 * 279.2 = ?

Wait, let's compute 279.2 * 29. 

279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait, no, that's 29*279.2. So 29 * 279.2= 8096.8.

But 8315.67 is larger than 8096.8. Let me compute (8315.67 - 8096.8) = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.784.

So x ≈ 29 + 0.784 = 29.784 MeV.

So E_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait 279.2 * x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute x = 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me figure this division. 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Divide 218.87 by 279.2 → approximately 0.784.

So x ≈29.784 MeV.

So E_nu is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Now, E_mu can be found from E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.784 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Wait, but E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is rest energy plus kinetic energy.

Wait, the muon's rest energy is m_mu c²=105.7 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says KEs are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculation.

Option A: 2.84 and 26.8 → no.

Option B:7.2 and 32.8 → no.

Option C:3.52 and 20.8 → no.

So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the pion \(\pi^+\) is stationary, and its rest mass is \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon \(\mu^+\) has a rest mass \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino \(\nu\) is assumed to have negligible rest mass (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the energy is just the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_{\mu}\)) and the neutrino's total energy (\(E_{\nu}\)):  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = -p_{\nu}.
   \]  
   For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, its energy is equal to its momentum (\(E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}c\)). For the muon, its energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\mu}c^2)^2}.
   \]

### Solving for Energies
Using the above equations, we solve for the energies of the muon and neutrino. Substituting \(p_{\mu} = E_{\nu}/c\) (from momentum conservation) into the muon's energy equation:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{E_{\nu}^2 + (m_{\mu}c^2)^2}.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu}\) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{E_{\nu}^2 + (105.7)^2} + E_{\nu}.
\]  
Let \(x = E_{\nu}\). Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
139.6 - x = \sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]  
\[
(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
139.6^2 - 2(139.6)x + x^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2.
\]  
\[
139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2(139.6)x.
\]  
Calculating the squares:  
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49.
\]  
\[
19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2(139.6)x.
\]  
\[
8315.67 = 279.2x.
\]  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Thus, \(E_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

The muon's total energy is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\nu} = 139.6 - 29.78 \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu}c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
