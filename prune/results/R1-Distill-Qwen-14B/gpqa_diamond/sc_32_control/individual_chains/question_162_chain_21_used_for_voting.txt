Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's written in terms of x and y. So this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's got dx and dy. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... oh right, that's a surface of constant negative curvature, like a hyperbolic space. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, or is this pseudosphere referring to something else? Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant something else, like a sphere in a certain geometry. Alternatively, maybe this metric represents a pseudosphere.

Wait, let me think again. The metric given: let's see. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. So the function is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Hmm. So when that denominator gets smaller, the metric component gets bigger, meaning that the geometry is more "stretched" there.

But wait, this is a 2D metric, right? So perhaps the surface is a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Or maybe it's part of a higher-dimensional space. Wait, no, the metric is two-dimensional because it has only dx and dy. So this is a 2D space. Maybe it's a model of hyperbolic space? Because I remember that hyperbolic space can have metrics that look similar.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry has a metric like ds² = [4/(1 + x² + y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). But that's different from the given metric. Let's see: if I compare, the denominator in the given metric is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. So 32/(4 - x² - y²) is similar but not the same as 4/(1 + x² + y²)^2.

Wait, maybe I can factor this. Let me see: 32 is 16 * 2. So 32/(4 - x² - y²) = (16 * 2) / (4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - (x² + y²)). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the area. The area in a metric is found by integrating the area element. The area element in this metric would be sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy^2) dx dy. But since this is diagonal, g_xy is zero, so the area element is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. But wait, g_xx and g_yy are both equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, that's the area element. So the area of the entire space (pseudosphere?) would be the integral of this area element over all x and y where the metric is defined. So I need to find the domain of x and y where 4 - x² - y² is positive, because otherwise the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would cause the metric to be singular.

So 4 - x² - y² > 0 => x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the interior of a circle with radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but that integral looks a bit tricky. Let me switch to polar coordinates, because the integral is over a circle, which is symmetric in all directions. So in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 (since r² = 4 implies r=2), of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So that's 32 * ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral. The θ integral is easy: ∫0 to 2π dθ is 2π.

So the area is 32 * 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Wait, let me compute the radial integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So - (1/2) du = r dr.

The integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 becomes ∫ [1/u] * (-1/2) du. Let's adjust the limits:

When r=0, u=4.

When r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 4 -4 =0.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du.

Which is (-1/2) * [ ln(u) ] evaluated from 4 to 0.

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm. Wait, let's see: the integral from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) du is [ln u] from 4 to 0 = (ln 0) - (ln4) = (-infty) - ln4.

So putting that back in: (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) = (1/2)(infty + ln4) ), which is infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right because the original area element is finite in the domain. Or is it? Wait, wait, no, because in the denominator, as r approaches 2, 4 - r² approaches zero, so the integrand becomes large. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Wait, so the area would be 32 * 2π * [ (1/2) (infty) ) ] which is infinite. So the area is infinite.

But wait, the options are given. Let me look again.

The options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the area is infinite, so the answer should be D) +infty.

Wait, but why does the question say pseudosphere of radius 2? Because the standard pseudosphere (like in hyperbolic space) has a finite area when considering the entire space? Or maybe in this metric, the area is infinite.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metric is that of a 2D hyperbolic space, and the "pseudosphere" refers to the entire hyperbolic plane. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area. So yeah, the area would be infinite.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To find the area, we use the area element associated with the metric, which is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Since the metric is diagonal (\( g_{xy} = 0 \)), the area element simplifies to:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is where the metric is well-defined, i.e., \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This is the interior of a circle of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over this domain. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Changing the limits accordingly (\( r = 0 \to u = 4 \), \( r = 2 \to u = 0 \)), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) du = \frac{16}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\frac{16}{2} \left[ \ln|u| \right]_0^4 = 8 \left( \ln 4 - \ln 0 \right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to infinity. This means the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite. The pseudosphere in this context refers to the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
