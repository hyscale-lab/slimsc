Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see what I can remember. The question is about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles after the decay. 

Alright, the pion, Pi(+), is stationary, so initially, it's not moving. It decays into a muon (mu(+)) and a neutrino (nu). Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny rest masses, right? I think for these kinds of problems, sometimes the rest mass of the neutrino is considered negligible compared to the other particles. So maybe I can treat it as massless. That might simplify things.

So, the rest mass of the pion is given as 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's mass is probably negligible, but just to be thorough, I should note that. 

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Let me recall the energy and momentum conservation principles. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, each product has its own energy. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is (almost) massless, so its energy is just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, which for neutrinos is almost zero. 

So, the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. That must equal the initial energy, so 139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu. 

Also, the total momentum must be zero. So the magnitudes of the muon's and neutrino's momenta must be equal. Let's denote the momenta as p_mu and p_nu. So p_mu = p_nu in magnitude, but opposite in direction. 

For the muon, its energy E_mu is given by the relativistic formula: E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Similarly, the neutrino's energy E_nu is just p_nu c, since its mass is negligible. 

So, by conservation of momentum, p_mu = p_nu. Let's just call this common momentum p. 

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and E_nu = p c.

The total energy equation becomes:
E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2
Substituting E_mu and E_nu:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c^2

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me consider c=1 for simplicity since the units are in MeV and will cancel out. So, setting c=1, the equation simplifies to:

sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_pi

Let me square both sides:

[ sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p ]^2 = m_pi^2

Expanding the left side:
(p^2 + m_mu^2) + 2 p sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p^2 = m_pi^2

Combine like terms:
2 p^2 + m_mu^2 + 2 p sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi^2

This looks messy. Maybe rearrange terms. Let's subtract 2p^2 + m_mu^2 from both sides:

2 p sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi^2 - 2p^2 - m_mu^2

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe let me denote q = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Then, the original equation:

q + p = m_pi

So, q = m_pi - p

Square both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2

Expand the right side:
m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2

So,

p^2 + m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2

The p^2 terms cancel:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p

Solve for p:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2

p = [ m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ] / (2 m_pi )

Ah, that's much better! So p is (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi )

Let me plug in the numbers. 
m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So,

p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6 )

Let me compute numerator first.

139.6^2 = let's compute that: 140^2 is 19600. But 139.6 is 0.4 less, so (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 -112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So numerator: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute this.

279.2 * 29 is 8096.8 (since 279 *30=8370, so 30-1=29 gives 279*29=8091, plus 0.2*29=5.8, so 8096.8). 

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87. Now, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ around 0.782.

So p ≈ 29.782 MeV/c? Wait, no, wait units. Wait, the p is in MeV/c multiplied by c, but since we set c=1, it's in MeV/c. 

Wait, no, the units are a bit confusing because we set c=1. So p is in units of MeV/c. So p ≈ 29.782 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me try 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8. 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 0.7826.

So p ≈ 29.7826 approximately.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = p c, but since we set c=1, it's just p ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait no, wait, when c=1, the energy is p c, which would be p in units of MeV/c multiplied by c (unit is m/s), but since we're working in natural units where c=1, the energy E_nu is just p in MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify units. The formula E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, when we set c=1, E = sqrt(p^2 + m^2). So for the neutrino, E_nu = p (since m=0). So E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

Similarly, the muon's energy E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = q. From earlier, q = m_pi - p.

So E_mu = 139.6 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 109.82 MeV.

Wait, let me calculate that accurately. 139.6 minus 29.78 is 109.82 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2. Again, with c=1, it's E_mu - m_mu.

So KE_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV.

For the neutrino, the rest mass is negligible, so KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu c^2 ≈ E_nu. So KE_nu ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the numbers again. Because sometimes in these decay problems, the neutrino's energy is treated as all kinetic since its rest mass is so small. So, yes, the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino is about 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That fits. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recheck the calculation for p.

m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Compute m_pi^2: 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m_mu^2: 105.7^2. Let's compute: 100^2 is 10000, 5^2 is 25, 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross terms: 2*(100)(5)=1000, 2*(100)(0.7)=140, 2*(5)(0.7)=7. So (100 +5 +0.7)^2 = 100^2 +5^2 +0.7^2 + 2*(100*5 + 100*0.7 +5*0.7) = 10000 +25 +0.49 + 2*(500 +70 +3.5) = 10025.49 + 2*(573.5) = 10025.49 + 1147 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute this.

Compute 279.2 * 29 = 279 *29 = (280 -1)*29 = 280*29 = 8120 -29= 8091. 0.2*29=5.8. So 279.2 *29=8091 +5.8=8096.8.

The numerator is 8315.67. Subtract 8096.8, get 218.87.

Now 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.7826.

So p ≈ 29.7826 MeV/c.

So E_nu is 29.78 MeV, and E_mu is 139.6 -29.78 = 109.82 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.82 -105.7 =4.12 MeV. 

KE_nu is 29.78 MeV. 

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Wait, another thought: when I set c=1, I assumed natural units, but perhaps I should have considered the actual units. Does that affect anything? Maybe not, because in the calculation, the units for p and E are in MeV/c and MeV respectively, which is correct.

So, the muon's KE is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV. So the correct option is D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon (\( \mu^+ \)) and a neutrino (\( \nu \)). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles.

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi^+} c^2
   \]
   where \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c \) (since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The pion is initially stationary, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. This implies that the magnitudes of the muon's and neutrino's momenta are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}
   \]

### Solving for Momentum and Energies
Let \( p \) denote the common magnitude of the momenta. Using energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} + p c = m_{\pi^+} c^2
\]
Dividing through by \( c^2 \) (setting \( c = 1 \) for simplicity):
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2
\]
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}
\]

Substituting the given masses:
\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]
First, calculate \( m_{\pi^+}^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+}^2 \):
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Energies and Kinetic Energies
1. **Neutrino Energy**: Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p c = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   Its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy:
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**: The muon's energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   Its kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
