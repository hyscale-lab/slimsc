Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Lagrangian problem. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about finding the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and determining whether the theory is renormalizable. 

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which makes it an antisymmetric tensor. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor from electromagnetism, I think, which is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. But wait, maybe this is a different gauge field? Oh, the problem doesn't specify, but I think F is a field strength, so the structure is similar to the Maxwell term.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4), the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Breaking down the terms in L_int: we have κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let's find the dimensions of each part.

I remember the conventions for the mass dimensions of fields. Fermion fields ψ typically have dimension 3/2 because in four dimensions, ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. Similarly, the field strength tensor F has dimension 2 because it's ∂μ Aν, and A has dimension 1, so each derivative adds 1, making F have dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Each gamma matrix has dimension 0 because they're just matrices, not fields. Since σ is a commutator of gamma matrices, it doesn't add any mass dimension. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Putting it all together, the term is κ * (ψ̄) (σ_{μν}) (ψ) (F^{μν})

The dimensions would be [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]. 

Wait, wait. No, wait. The product is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's calculate each component:

- ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.
- σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so 0.
- ψ is 3/2.
- F^{μν} is 2.

So each part's dimension:

ψ̄ → 3/2,
σ → 0,
ψ →3/2,
F →2.

So the product is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = (3/2 + 3/2) is 3, plus 2 gives 5. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5.

The Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this product. So the dimension is [κ] + 5 = 4 (because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4). Therefore, [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I thought the Lagrangian term is dimension 4. So the product of the fields and coupling must sum to 4. So:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, no, because the term is κ multiplied by those fields. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. So [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, for the renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive or zero mass dimension. Because, for each loop, you have to have terms that don't get higher and higher in dimension, which would make the theory non-predictive.

Wait, no. The coupling constants must have dimension less than or equal to 4 in 4 dimensions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the dimension of the coupling determines the superficial degree of divergence. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a dimension that allows the interaction to be marginal or better (i.e., dimension ≤4 in 4d). But wait, in four dimensions, the coupling (which is a parameter in the Lagrangian) must have mass dimension ≤4.

But here, the coupling κ has dimension -1. Wait, that's a negative dimension. That would mean that the term is non-renormalizable because higher mass dimension couplings would require higher-dimensional operators, which are non-renormalizable.

Wait, but in this case, the coupling is dimension -1. So when you have a term with a coupling of negative dimension, that implies that the interaction term is of higher order. Because in the Lagrangian, the term must have dimension 4. So for your term to have lower dimension, you need a higher power of the field, or a higher dimension coupling.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the scaling. The term in the Lagrangian is of dimension 4. Let me think about the scaling. The interaction term is L ~ κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Each field contributes their dimension. The coupling κ must scale as [κ] = 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). So if the sum of the fields is 5, [κ] is -1.

But for a renormalizable theory, the coupling should have [κ] ≥0 because otherwise, when you go to higher loops, you get higher dimension operators, which you can't absorb into the original Lagrangian.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The dimension of the coupling determines how the coupling runs with energy. If [κ]_M is negative, then the theory is non-renormalizable because the coupling becomes stronger at lower energies, leading to the Landau pole and making the theory not predictive at low energies.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: in four dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if each term has fields with a total dimension ≤4. But in this case, the product of the fields is dimension 5, so to make the term dimension 4, the coupling must be dimension -1. Since the coupling is negative, the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but I think the key is whether the interaction term is renormalizable, which depends on the dimension of the coupling. If the coupling has dimension [κ] = -1, which is less than zero, then the term is not renormalizable. Because in general, for a term like g φ^n, where φ has dimension d, the coupling g must have dimension [g] = 4 - n d. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0, because otherwise you need an infinite number of counterterms.

Wait, in this case, the term is not of the form g φ^n. It's a term involving four fields? Or more precisely, multiple fields with different dimensions.

Wait, in the interaction term, how many fields are there? Let's count: ψ̄, ψ, F, and κ. So the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, F is 2.

So each ψ contributes (3/2), and F contributes 2. So sum of the fields' dimensions is 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. So the product is dimension 5. So the coupling's dimension is 4 - 5 = -1.

In general, for a term in the Lagrangian, the dimension of each term must be 4. So the product of the coupling and the fields must sum to 4. So if the coupling's dimension is negative, that implies that the term is of higher order. Like, for example, a higher-dimensional operator.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, higher-dimensional operators are non-renormalizable. So if the coupling is dimension -1, the term is dimension 4, but the coupling is negative, which implies that the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the general condition. For a term in the Lagrangian L ~ g φ^k, the dimension must be 4. So [g] + k [φ] =4. For renormalizability, [g] must be ≥ 0. Because if [g] is negative, each time you have a loop, you get factors that might make the coupling's dimension even more negative, leading to non-renormalizable terms.

In this problem, our coupling is κ, and [κ] is -1. So the term is of the form κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Since [κ] is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together, κ has mass dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. Option A has [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \) and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian over spacetime, is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must therefore also have mass dimension 4.

The term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) consists of the following components:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) and \( \psi \): Fermion fields with mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \): A commutator of gamma matrices, which is dimensionless (\( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0 \)).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \): Field strength tensor with mass dimension 2.

The total mass dimension of the product \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must have mass dimension 4, the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the theory remains predictive at all energy scales. In this case, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) has mass dimension \( -1 \), which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is non-renormalizable because it corresponds to a higher-dimensional operator. Such terms introduce divergences that cannot be absorbed into the original Lagrangian, making the theory non-predictive at low energies.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**C) The mass dimension \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \). The theory is not renormalizable.**
