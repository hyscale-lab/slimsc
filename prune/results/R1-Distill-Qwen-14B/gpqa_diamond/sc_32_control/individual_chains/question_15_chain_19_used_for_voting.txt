Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting based on the given information. Let me think through this step by step.

So, both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. The key factors here are their orbital periods and the properties of their host stars. The question is about which planet has a higher chance of transiting when observed from Earth.

Transit probability depends on a few things. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But for exoplanets, the probability also depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. 

Wait, right! The formula for transit probability (P) is roughly (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies to P ≈ (R_p / a), where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the orbital distance. But wait, wait—actually, no. I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember is that the probability is approximately (R_* / a) * (something), but wait, no. Maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, no—transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Wait, no, the planet's size compared to the star's size, and the orbital distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The transit probability (P) is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_*)² × ( (R_* / a) ), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, another way: the probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area seen from Earth as the planet moves. Hmm, I'm not recalling the exact formula, but I think another approach is better.

Alternatively, the transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / R_*) × (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_* / a)^2))) ), but that's getting complicated. Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The probability P for a planet to transit is approximately (R_p / R_*)² × (1 / (1 - (R_* / a)^2 )). But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the factors that influence it.

Wait, another approach. The probability of transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Because a planet has to pass in front of the star for a transit to occur, the chance is higher if the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance. So, P = (R_* / a) * something. Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the main factors are the planet's orbital distance (a) and the size of the star. In this problem, the host stars have the same radius (since both have the same radii). So R_*1 = R_*2 = R.

So the only variable is the orbital distance a. The closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the higher the probability of transit because the star appears smaller from the planet's perspective, so the planet is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, no. Wait, no, if the planet is closer (smaller a), then the orbital distance is smaller. So for a fixed star size, a smaller a would mean the planet's orbit is more likely to pass in front of the star as seen from Earth. Because the orbital distance is smaller, the area where the planet can be in front of the star is larger. So the probability would be higher when a is smaller.

But wait, we have two planets. Let's see:

Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = (1/3) P2. Both are in circular orbits. Using Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_* + m_p)/(4π²). But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_* + m_p ≈ M_*. So for each planet, a^3 ∝ M_* * P².

Wait, but the host stars have different masses. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host of Planet_2. So M1 = 2 M2.

So, for Planet_1: a1^3 ∝ M1 * P1² → a1^3 ∝ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M2 * P2² / 9.

For Planet_2: a2^3 ∝ M2 * P2².

So the ratio a1 / a2 = [ (2 M2 * P2² /9 ) / (M2 * P2²) ]^(1/3) = [ (2/9) ) ]^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ ~0.6. So a1 is approximately 0.6 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2 because Planet_1 is orbiting a more massive star and has a shorter period, leading to a closer orbit.

Since the transit probability is higher when a is smaller (for same R_*), Planet_1 is closer, so it has a higher probability to transit.

Wait, but let me make sure. Suppose a is smaller: the planet’s orbit is tighter. Therefore, from our point of view, the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits is higher. Because the orbital distance is smaller, the solid angle where the planet can be in front is larger.

So the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a), but wait, I think the exact formula is P = (R_p / R_*)² × (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_* / a)^2 )) ) ), but that's getting complicated, but given that R_* is the same for both, it's about a.

Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_* / a) * (something else), but perhaps a more simplified approach is to compare a1 and a2.

Since a1 is smaller, and the star radius is same, the probability for Planet_1 to transit is higher.

Wait, but let me think about the exact factors. The probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, but scaled by some factor.

Wait, maybe the probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / a) ), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, a more accurate approach: the transit probability (P) is the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is approximately (R_* / a) * (something else). Wait, I think the exact formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_*)² × (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_* / a)^2 )) ) ), but that might be for the duration or depth of the transit.

Wait, perhaps a better way. The transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the sphere at the planet's orbital distance. No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, multiplied by some function.

Wait, another thought. The transit probability (P) is given by:

P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - (R_* / a)^2 )^(1/2)) )

Wait, I'm not certain. Let me look for another approach. Since the star radii are the same, and the planet radii are the same (since they're Earth-like), the transit probability depends on a. The closer the planet is (smaller a), the higher the probability.

So, since a1 < a2, Planet_1 has a higher probability.

But let me calculate the exact ratio.

We have a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) = a2 * (2/9)^0.333.

Calculating (2/9) ≈ 0.2222, cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So P1 is proportional to (R_* / a1), and P2 is proportional to (R_* / a2). So the ratio P1/P2 = (R_* / a1) / (R_* / a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1/(0.606) ≈ 1.65.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If a1 is smaller, then R_* / a1 is larger. So P1 is higher. So the probability ratio is (R_* / a1) / (R_* /a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that P is proportional to (R_* / a). So if a1 is 0.606 a2, then R_* / a1 is (1 / 0.606) times (R_* / a2), which is ~1.65 times. So Planet_1 has a transit probability 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The probability is higher for a planet with a smaller a. So if a1 is 0.6 a2, then the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of (a2/a1) = 1.65. So the probability of Planet_1 is higher by about 1.65 times.

Wait, but the answer options are:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to about 1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times higher.

So according to this, C would be correct.

But let me double-check the calculation for a1 and a2.

Using Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_*)/(4π²). So a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4π² )

For Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P2 /3.

So a1^3 = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4π² )

= (G M2 P2^2 * 2 / 9 ) / (4 π² )

For Planet_2: a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606, as before.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

Thus, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R_* / a1) = (R_*/a2) * (a2/a1) = (R_* / a2 ) * (1/0.606) ≈ 1.65 times (R_* / a2 )

So Planet_1 has a transit probability ~1.65 times higher than Planet_2, meaning they prefer to observe Planet_1. So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information:

1. **Transit Probability Basics**: The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight and the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. For circular orbits, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet.

2. **Key Information**:
   - Both planets have the same mass and radius, and their host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)).
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period (\( P_1 \)) that is three times shorter than Planet_2 (\( P_2 \)).
   - The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).

3. **Orbital Distance Calculation**:
   Using Kepler's Third Law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), we calculate the ratio of the orbital distances:
   \[
   \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
   \]
   Taking the cube root:
   \[
   \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is much closer to its host star than Planet_2.

4. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   Since the transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), the ratio of the probabilities is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
   \]
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the calculations, Planet_1 is preferred for observation due to its higher transit probability.
