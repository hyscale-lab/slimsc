Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass, and the options are given.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. But this is a relativistic case, so things must be different because of the effects of special relativity.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would just be v_max^2 = (kA^2)/m, right? Because the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA^2, which converts to kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max^2 at maximum speed. So v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, the question is relativistic, so option C can't be the right answer here. So I can eliminate option C right away.

Hmm, but wait. Wait, the problem is relativistic. So the energy considerations change because the total energy can't exceed the rest mass energy plus the potential energy. Also, relativistic mechanics introduces gamma factors.

Let me think about the energy in this system. The total energy of the oscillator in relativity would be the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) and the potential energy (1/2 kA²), assuming the potential energy is maximum at amplitude A. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, wait. I'm not so sure. In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So the total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's energy is quantized relativistically, but maybe that's more quantum mechanics. But the question is about a classical oscillator, so perhaps we can model it as a particle moving with velocity v, and at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

But wait, relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is gamma mc². But then again, the potential energy in the oscillator is (1/2)kx². So at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E = (1/2)kA² + mc² (rest energy) plus any relativistic kinetic energy at other points?

Wait, no. Because in the relativistic scenario, the total energy is a combination of rest energy and kinetic energy. At the maximum displacement A, the mass comes to rest momentarily, so its velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is just mc² (since gamma is 1 at rest). So the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, that can't be right because when the mass is moving, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the mass is at position x = A, it's at rest, so gamma is 1, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy at that point is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic: E = (gamma) mc². So setting the two expressions for E equal:

At x=A: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².
At x=0: E = gamma mc².

So equate them: gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Wait, so gamma equals 1 plus (k A squared) over (2 m c squared). So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can set that equal and solve for v.

Let me write that equation:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable for simplicity, say, let me call it alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma = 1 + alpha.

So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

I can square both sides to make it easier:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

Hmm, let me compute that:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Let me expand (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So numerator is (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v² = c² (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But since alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a small quantity if the oscillator's maximum displacement isn't too large, but in any case, let's substitute alpha back in.

Wait, but maybe I can factor this differently. Let's see:

v² = c² [ (alpha (2 + alpha) ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of the original variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for v_max in terms of c and the given parameters.

So, let me substitute alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ ( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ ( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Hmm, maybe I can factor numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, let's compute it as:

v_max^2 = c^2 (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2.

Let me expand the denominator: (1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

Wait, perhaps there's a way to rearrange this.

Alternatively, let me compute each part:

2 alpha + alpha² = alpha (2 + alpha)

Divided by (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, but with this approach, it's getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can write gamma as 1 + alpha, and then solve for v.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me write this as:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

I can take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + alpha).

Then, square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²)/(1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

v/c = sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha).

Wait, but let me compute it for alpha << 1. For example, if alpha is small (k A^2 << 2 m c^2), then we can approximate.

But perhaps I should look back at the options. The options are given, and I need to find which one matches this expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, that denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2m). Wait, but in our case, the denominator is 1 + alpha, which is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). So perhaps this option is not matching.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Hmm, let me see.

Wait, option B's expression inside the sqrt is 1 + 1 / (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)).

Wait, let me compute this expression. Let me denote beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - beta)).

Which is sqrt( ( (1 - beta) + 1 )/(1 - beta) ) ) = sqrt( (2 - beta)/(1 - beta) ).

Hmm, I don't think that matches what we have.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) )

Wait, let me compute this. Let's let beta be (k A²)/(2 m c²), so option D is c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 )

Wait, 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

The numerator is (1 + 2 beta + beta^2) -1 = 2 beta + beta^2.

So, the expression becomes sqrt( [2 beta + beta^2]/(1 + beta)^2 ) ) = sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta).

Which matches our earlier expression for v/c.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( [2 beta + beta^2]/(1 + beta)^2 ) ) = c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta).

Which is the same as v_max = c * sqrt( [beta (2 + beta)] ) / (1 + beta).

Hmm, but let me look back at the options.

Wait, option D is written as c times sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ). Which is the same as what we have for v/c.

Because,

v/c = sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2)/(1 + beta)^2 )

= sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] ) / (1 + beta )

= sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) ) / (1 + beta )

Which is the same as sqrt( [ (1 + beta)^2 -1 ] ) / (1 + beta )

But wait, perhaps a better way is to see that:

Our expression for v_max is c times sqrt( [2 beta + beta^2]/(1 + beta)^2 ) )= c times sqrt( (beta (2 + beta)) ) / (1 + beta )

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

But looking at the options, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1+beta)^2 )

Which is exactly the same as our expression for v/c, so v_max is c times that, which would make it correct.

Wait, no. Because:

Earlier, we have v_max = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

Which is the same as c * sqrt( (beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( [beta (2 + beta)] ) / (1 + beta )

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] ) / (1 + beta )

Because (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2. So (1 + beta)^2 -1 = 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (1 + beta)^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta )

= c * sqrt( ( (1 + beta)^2 -1 ) ) / (1 + beta )

= c * sqrt( ( (1 + beta)^2 -1 ) ) / (1 + beta )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + beta)^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + beta)^2 -1 ] ) / (1 + beta )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + beta)^2 -1 ] ) / (1 + beta )

= c * sqrt( ( (1 + beta)^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

Which is,

v/c = sqrt( ( (1 + beta)^2 -1 ) ) / (1 + beta )

= sqrt( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ) ) / (1 + beta )

= sqrt( 2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )

Which is the same as sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, but perhaps I can factor this expression.

Wait, let me consider beta being small. Let's say beta is small, so beta << 1. Then, we can expand the expression.

But perhaps it's easier to compare with the options.

Looking at option D, which is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 )

Which, as I showed earlier, is the same as our expression.

So option D's expression is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because option D is written as sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ), which is exactly the same as what we derived for (v/c)^2.

Wait, no, because:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So, v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 )

So, yes, option D would be correct.

Alternatively, let's compute what option D says:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which is exactly the same as our expression.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option C is the non-relativistic case. So in the relativistic case, the maximum speed would be less than c, right? Because when you include relativity, the speed can't reach c.

Wait, but in our expression, as beta approaches zero (non-relativistic limit), let's see what happens.

Beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²). If beta is very small, then 1 + beta is approximately 1, and 1/(1 + beta)^2 is approximately 1.

So, 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ≈ 1 - 1 = 0, but that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, v_max is sqrt(kA²/m).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the energy equations.

In the non-relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², and when the mass is at x=0, all of that is kinetic: (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C.

But in the relativistic case, the total energy would be E = (gamma) mc².

Wait, but earlier I assumed that E = mc² + (1/2) kA², but that might be incorrect. Because in relativity, the potential energy is (1/2) k x², but the total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the oscillator in terms of total energy which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, and the potential energy.

Wait, no, that might not be correct because in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy is part of the total energy. So at x = A, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero, but the potential energy is (1/2) k A². So the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2) k A².

But when the mass is at x = 0, all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy is E = gamma mc².

Setting them equal: gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²: gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) → gamma = 1 + beta, where beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, so beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma = 1 + beta.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + beta.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + beta).

Squaring both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + beta)^2 ]

= [ (1 + beta)^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta)^2

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 beta + beta²) -1 = 2 beta + beta².

So,

v²/c² = (2 beta + beta²)/(1 + beta)^2.

Which can be written as:

v² = c² (2 beta + beta²)/(1 + beta)^2.

So,

v = c sqrt( (2 beta + beta²)/(1 + beta)^2 )

= c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, but looking back at the options, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 )

Which, as I saw earlier, this is the same as our expression.

Because,

sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + beta)^2 ]) = sqrt( ( (1 + beta)^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ) ) / (1 + beta )

= sqrt( 2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )

Which is the same as our v.

So option D is correct.

But wait, what about option B? Let me check.

Option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)))

Which is with 1 - beta, where beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, 1/(1 - beta) is larger than 1, so 1 + 1/(1 - beta) would be even larger. Then the square root of that would be larger than 1, leading to v_max greater than c, which is impossible. So option B can't be correct, because it leads to v_max greater than c. So that's ruled out.

Similarly, option A has 1 - (k A^2)/(2m), which is different because it's missing the c² in the denominator. So that's probably incorrect.

So the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( A \):  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   At \( x = 0 \), the total energy is purely kinetic, so:  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Let \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so \( \gamma = 1 + \beta \).

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}
   \]

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}} \)  
     This is incorrect because the denominator lacks \( c^2 \), leading to inconsistencies in dimensional analysis.  
   - **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}} \)  
     This is incorrect because it implies \( v_{\text{max}} > c \), which violates the speed limit of special relativity.  
   - **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
     This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects.  
   - **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}} \)  
     This matches the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) and is therefore correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately reflects the relativistic maximum speed of the harmonic oscillator.

Answer: D
