Okay, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the key points are:
- ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17.
- HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16.
- So, a star must be brighter than 16 mag (apparent V mag <=16) to be detected by both, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go down to 17. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So that means ESPRESSO observes stars with V <=17. Similarly, HIRES observes stars brighter than 16, so V <=16.

Wait, no. Wait, magnitude is a bit counterintuitive. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than V=17, that means its V is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the apparent V magnitude must be <=17. For HIRES, it must be <=16.

So a star can be detected by both if its apparent V magnitude is <=16. Because if it's brighter than (V < 16), then it's within both limits. If it's between 16 and 17, it can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

So the stars must have apparent V magnitudes <=16 to be detectable by both.

Now, let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So the apparent V magnitude is calculated as m = M + 5 log10(d/10). Wait, distance modulus. The formula is m - M = 5 log10(d) -5. So d is in parsecs. For 10 pc: m = M + 5 log(10/10) = M + 0. So m=15.5. So m is 15.5, which is less than 16. So Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5.

Wait, but what about interstellar extinction? The problem says to disregard the absorption? No, wait, the question states that Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V) given, so I think absorption needs to be considered for them. So for Star1, no E(B-V) given, so assume no extinction. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5, which is under 16. So detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag. So that's above 16. So HIRES can't observe it (needs <=16). So Star2 can't be detected by both. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5. Wait, but it has E(B-V) = 0.6. So there's extinction. The problem says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the extinction A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, but considering extinction, the observed magnitude is higher. Wait, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5. But wait, E(B-V) is the color excess, which affects the observed magnitude. So how does this work?

Wait, the apparent magnitude given in Star3 is "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". But wait, that's the observed magnitude after extinction. Wait, no. Wait, no. No, the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m0, but due to extinction, the observed m is m0 + A_V.

Wait, but the problem says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But that's the observed value, right? Or is that the intrinsic value before extinction? Hmm, the wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's the observed apparent magnitude. Then, E(B-V) is given. Wait, but E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the observed (B-V) minus intrinsic (B-V). But extinction affects the V magnitude. So Star3's observed V magnitude is 15.5, but the question states that E(B-V) is 0.6. So that would imply that there's interstellar extinction, which makes the star appear dimmer (since light is absorbed and scattered, making it appear fainter). So the intrinsic V magnitude is m0 = m_observed - A_V. Because extinction makes the star appear fainter (higher magnitude). So m_observed = m0 + A_V. So m0 = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, but wait, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is their observed value. But if we have extinction, then the intrinsic magnitude (without extinction) would be lower (brighter). So the actual apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be 15.5 - A_V. Because when extinction is present, the observed magnitude is higher than the intrinsic. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, I think I should approach this step by step.

For each star, we need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, considering extinction if applicable, and see if it's <=16.

Star1: No extinction. m=15.5. So detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5. So only detectable by ESPRESSO. Since HIRES requires m <=16.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5. But E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=3.1 * 0.6=1.86. So the extinction makes the apparent magnitude brighter or fainter? Extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so higher magnitude.

Wait, but in the problem, the apparent V is already observed. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if m_observed is 15.5, then m_intrinsic is 15.5 - A_V. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if the star has extinction, the observed m is higher than the intrinsic. So I think I got it backwards.

Wait, the equation is m - M = 5 log d -5, but that's without extinction. If extinction is present, the apparent magnitude increases (becomes larger) because the star is dimmer. So the observed m is m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but Star3's observed m is 15.5. So its intrinsic m (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V. So 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. So without extinction, that's 13.64. But that's not the point. Because when considering what is observed, extinction has already happened. So the observed m is 15.5, which is what matters for the instrument.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because the instrument detects the observed magnitude. So if a star has an extinction, the observed m is higher (dimmer). So the question is, what is the apparent V magnitude that the spectrograph would detect. For Star3, the observed m is 15.5, but with extinction, so if we account for it, the intrinsic m would be 15.5 - 1.86=13.64. But wait, that's not relevant because the star's observed magnitude is 15.5. So when the spectrograph looks at it, it measures m=15.5. So to determine if it's detectable by the instrument, use the observed m.

Wait, no, but the extinction is part of the observed magnitude. So when the question says Star3's apparent V is 15.5, that's after extinction. So the observed m is 15.5. So for the telescope, that's the value. So m=15.5, which is under 16. So detectable by both.

Wait, but this would mean that Star3's m is 15.5, which is okay for both. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude given is the observed value, which already includes extinction. So for Star3, m=15.5, which is bright enough for both. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Star4: Absolute V is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m = M + 5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 log(10/10)=15.5. So m=15.5. But Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed m is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So the intrinsic m_intrinsic is m_observed - A_V. Wait, wait, no. Wait, m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if the star's intrinsic (without extinction) m is 15.5, then m_observed would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So the observed m is 16.74.

So Star4's observed m is 16.74. So, for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, 16.74 is okay. But for HIRES, which requires m <=16, 16.74 is too faint. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, Star4's absolute magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m = M + 5 log(d/10) = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. This is the intrinsic magnitude without extinction. Then, the observed m is 15.5 + A_V =16.74. So Star4's observed apparent V mag is 16.74, which is greater than 16. So HIRES can't observe it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star5: Absolute V is 16.5, located at 5 pc.

So calculate m: m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5).

Log(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m≈15.0.

But wait, without extinction, Star5's m is 15.0. The problem says Star5 has no E(B-V), so no extinction. So m=15.0. That's below 16, so detectable by both. Wait, but wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5. Wait, if it's at 5 pc, m =16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 * (-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995, which is about 15.0. So m=15.0, which is less than 16. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, the problem says Star5 has an absolute V magnitude of 16.5, located at 5 pc.

So M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = 16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m=15.0. So Star5's apparent V is 15.0. So it's detectable by both.

So now, which stars have apparent V <=16?

Let me list each star's observed apparent V:

Star1: 15.5 (no extinction) → yes.

Star2: 16.5 → no (HIRES can't)

Star3: 15.5 (observed, with extinction) → yes.

Star4: 16.74 → no (HIRES can't)

Star5: 15.0 → yes.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Wait, but looking back, the options are: the options are A to D, each pairing two stars.

Wait, the options given are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both, so no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both, so this is a possible option.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't, as 16.5 >16.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct option would include Star3 and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but let me recheck Star3 and Star5.

Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is under 16, so both can detect.

Star5's m is 15.0, under 16, so both can detect.

So the correct pair is Star3 and Star5.

Looking at the options, option B says Star3 and Star5. So answer is B.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me double-check Star4 and Star5.

Wait, Star5's m is 15.0, which is under both limits. So both spectrographs can see it.

Star3's situation: we have to be careful. The problem says Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5, and whether the extinction is already included in that m? Because the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag", and I think that is the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So if that's the case, then Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If a star has E(B-V)=0.6, that means that the extinction (A_V) is 3.1 *0.6=1.86. So the star's observed V magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if m_observed is 15.5, then m_intrinsic is 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But for the purpose of the instruments, what matters is the observed m. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is under both 16 and 17. So it's detectable by both.

Star5's m is 15.0, so yes.

So the correct answer is that Star3 and Star5 are detectable by both. Looking at the options, option B is "Star3 and Star5".

But wait, looking back at Star4: m_observed is 16.74, which is above 16. So not detectable by HIRES.

Star1 has m=15.5, so detectable by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the question is which option includes two of them.

Looking at options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both correct.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 not correct.

So the correct pair is B.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m \leq 17$), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m \leq 16$). Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude of $m \leq 16$ to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$, distance: $d = 10$ pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
   - No extinction (no $E(B-V)$ given).  
   - Observed $m = 15.5$, which is $\leq 16$.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES**.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 16.5$.  
   - Observed $m = 16.5$, which is $> 16$.  
   - **Not detectable by HIRES**, only detectable by ESPRESSO.  

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$, so $A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - The apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction, so the observed $m = 15.5$.  
   - $m = 15.5 \leq 16$.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES**.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$, distance: $d = 10$ pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$, so $A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed $m = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - $m = 16.74 > 16$.  
   - **Not detectable by HIRES**, only detectable by ESPRESSO.  

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M = 16.5$, distance: $d = 5$ pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0$.  
   - No extinction (no $E(B-V)$ given).  
   - Observed $m = 15.0 \leq 16$.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES**.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the options provided, the pair **Star3 and Star5** is the correct choice.

**Answer: B**
