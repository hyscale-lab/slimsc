Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a meson resonance called X, and they're asking for the mean decay distance. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark.

The given data are the production energy Ex = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and the width ΓX = 320 MeV. Hmm, I think the width here refers to the decay width, which is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh wait, the decay width Γ is connected to the particle's lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I remember is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, but wait, actually, I think the relationship is Γ = ħ / τ, which would mean τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the uncertainty principle. The lifetime is the time it takes for the particle to decay, so the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the decay width Γ. So Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, and the uncertainty in time Δt is the lifetime, so ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. That makes Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance. The mean distance should be the product of the velocity v of the particle and its lifetime τ. So d = v * τ.

But wait, how do I get the velocity? The particle is produced with energy Ex, so I can find its velocity using relativistic equations. The total energy E is related to mass and momentum. Let me recall the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².

So, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. Let me compute the momentum p. Rearranging the equation: (pc)² = E² - (mc²)². So pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²). But GeV and c²... Oh wait, units might complicate things. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. Then E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c² multiplied by c², so the units might cancel out, but I'll have to handle the units carefully.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything to SI units to avoid confusion. Let me list the constants and units:

ħ (reduced Planck) ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s,

c ≈ 3.0 × 10^8 m/s,

1 GeV = 1.602 × 10^-10 J,

1 MeV = 1e-3 GeV = 1.602e-13 J.

Wait, but maybe working in natural units is easier, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of c=1 and then convert the distance at the end.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

First, find the velocity v of the meson. The energy is 8 GeV, mass 1.2 GeV/c². So,

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

We can solve for p: pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

But since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to work in units where c=1. Then,

E² = p² + m² → p = sqrt(E² - m²).

So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV/c.

Calculating that: 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Now, the velocity v can be found from relativistic equations. The relation between velocity and momentum is p = γ m v, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But since in natural units (c=1), p = γ m v, and γ = E/(m c²) → but again, with c=1, γ = E/m.

So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ = 6.6667, which is 20/3.

Alternatively, we can find v using the relation:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (m²/(E²))).

Wait, let me think. Since E² = p² c² + m² c^4, dividing both sides by m² c^4 gives:

(E/(m c²))² = (p c/(m c²))² + 1.

Let β = v/c. Then p c = β γ m c². So,

(E/(m c²)) = sqrt( (p c/(m c²))² + (m c²/(m c²))² )

Which simplifies to γ = sqrt(β² γ² + 1). Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Let me think again.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, let me re-derive it.

In natural units (c=1), E = γ m, and p = γ β m.

So β = p/(γ m) = (sqrt(E² - m²)) / E.

So β = sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

So in our case, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So m/E = 1.2 / 8 = 0.15.

So β = sqrt(1 - 0.15^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

But wait, let me calculate it more precisely. 0.15 squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the lifetime τ is determined by the decay width Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, the decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. So I need to convert that into energy units that match with ħ.

Since ħ is in J·s, and Γ is in MeV, I need to convert Γ into J.

Γ = 320 MeV = 320 × 1.602e-13 J ≈ 5.1264e-11 J.

Wait, let me compute that: 320 MeV = 320 * 1.602e-13 J = 320 * 1.602e-13 = 5.1264e-11 J.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (5.1264e-11) s.

Let me compute that:

1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 ≈ (1.0545718 / 5.1264) ) * 1e-23.

1.0545718 /5.1264 ≈ approx 0.2057.

So τ ≈ 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1e-34 divided by 1e-11 is 1e-23. So yes, that's correct.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance is d = v * τ.

v is approximately 0.9887 c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So d = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s ≈ (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e-16 m.

Compute 2.966 * 2.057:

Let's compute 3 * 2.057 is about 6.171, but since it's 2.966, which is 3 - 0.034, so:

2.966 * 2.057 ≈ (3 - 0.034) * 2.057 = 3*2.057 - 0.034*2.057 ≈ 6.171 - 0.070 ≈ 6.101.

So d ≈ 6.101e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options are in 1e-15 or 1e-16. Hmm. So 6e-16 would be 0.6e-15, which isn't any of the options. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating τ. Let me re-examine that step.

Γ is 320 MeV. So Γ = 320 × 1e6 eV. Wait, because 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, right? No, wait, wait. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. So 320 MeV is 320 × 1e6 eV = 3.2e8 eV.

But I think I made a mistake earlier. When I converted Γ (320 MeV) to joules, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate that:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 joules.

So 320 MeV = 320 × 1e6 eV = 3.2e8 eV.

So converting to joules: 3.2e8 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = (3.2 * 1.602) * 1e-11 J.

3.2 * 1.602 = approximately 5.1264.

So Γ = 5.1264e-11 J.

So back to τ: τ = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's correct. So τ is about 2.057e-24 seconds.

Then v is approximately 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So d = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = ?

Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24.

2.966e8 is 2.966 × 1e8, and 2.057e-24 is 2.057 × 1e-24.

Multiplying the coefficients: 2.966 * 2.057 ≈ let me compute it accurately.

2.966 × 2 = 5.932.

2.966 × 0.057 = approx 0.168.

So total ≈ 5.932 + 0.168 = 6.1.

So 6.1 × 1e8 × 1e-24 = 6.1 × 1e-16 m.

So d ≈ 6.1e-16 meters.

But the options are:

A) 5.0223 *10^-16 m

B)4.0655 *10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

Hmm, none of the options are around 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should double-check my velocity.

Wait, earlier I calculated β = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.15^2) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute 1.2/8 accurately. 1.2 ÷ 8 = 0.15, correct. So (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887, so v is 0.9887 c.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ. Let me recheck Γ.

Wait, I have Γ = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So Γ = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J.

320e6 is 3.2e8, so 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = (3.2 *1.602) )e-11 = about 5.1264e-11 J. So that's correct.

Then τ = ħ / Γ.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11.

Compute that: 1.0545718e-34 /5.1264e-11 = (1.0545718 /5.1264 ) * 1e-23.

1.0545718 /5.1264 ≈ approx 0.2057.

So τ = 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute v more precisely. Let me calculate β more accurately.

β = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(0.9775).

Wait, what's the exact value of sqrt(0.9775)?

Let me compute it with more precision.

0.9887 squared is (0.9887)^2 = 0.97754, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v is about 0.9887 c, which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So d = v * τ = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute this more precisely.

2.9661e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.057) e (8 -24) = 6.102e-16 m.

Hmm, but that's about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: the width Γ is given in MeV, but perhaps I should have converted it into GeV? Because the natural units are in GeV, but I used MeV and converted it to J, which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute Γ in natural units. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the mean decay length is different. Wait, perhaps we can use the formula for the decay length:

d = c * τ * β γ,

Wait, where β γ is the Lorentz factor times beta. Because the lifetime is τ, and the particle is moving at velocity β c, so the distance is β c τ multiplied by γ, perhaps? Wait, no, I think the mean lifetime is τ, but the proper time is τ. The lab frame time would be longer by γ, but the decay process is in the lab frame, so that's where the confusion comes in.

Wait, no, I think the mean lifetime is τ, and the time experienced in the lab frame is longer. But wait, no, the decay width is Γ, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. The lifetime τ is the proper time, but the decay process happens in the lab frame, so the lifetime observed is longer by a factor of γ. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the decay width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime as Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the rest frame. So when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by the Lorentz factor γ. Because of time dilation. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ.

Ah, that's where I went wrong earlier. So the decay length is v multiplied by the dilated lifetime.

So d = v * (γ τ) = β c * (γ τ).

Which is d = β γ c τ.

So I think I forgot to include the gamma factor earlier. Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer by gamma.

So I need to recalculate, including the gamma factor.

So let's correct that.

We have:

d = β γ c τ.

We have β = 0.9887, gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667.

Now, tau is ħ / (Γ).

But wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier because Γ is given in MeV, and I used it directly in J, which is correct. So let's proceed.

We have:

d = β * gamma * c * tau.

But tau is ħ / (Γ).

Wait, but let me re-express this.

tau = ħ / (Γ).

But when Γ is in energy units, say in J, then tau is in seconds.

So let me recompute d.

tau = ħ / (320 MeV in J) = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (320e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV) = 1.0545718e-34 / (5.1264e-11) ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Then, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Then, the decay length is v * lab frame lifetime.

v = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So d = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = let's compute this.

Multiply 2.966e8 and 1.371e-23.

2.966 *1.371 ≈ 4.065.

So 4.065e (8 -23) = 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, that's 4.065e-15 m, which is option B: 4.0655 *10^-15 m.

Wait, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which matches this.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation steps.

First, beta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Tau (proper time) is ħ / Γ.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J, so Γ = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.

Tau = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Then, the velocity v is beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Decay distance d = v * (gamma tau) = 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = approx 4.065e-15 meters.

So option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following data:

- Production energy: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Mass: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Decay width: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X}{E_X}\right)^2}
\]

Substituting \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Therefore:

\[
v \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]

The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \). Converting \( \Gamma \) to joules:

\[
\Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J/MeV} \approx 5.1264 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\tau = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.1264 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( d \)
The mean decay distance is given by:

\[
d = v \cdot t,
\]

where \( t \) is the lifetime in the lab frame. Due to time dilation, the lab frame lifetime is:

\[
t = \gamma \tau,
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

Thus:

\[
t = 6.6667 \cdot 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

Now, calculate \( d \):

\[
d = v \cdot t = (2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}) \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
