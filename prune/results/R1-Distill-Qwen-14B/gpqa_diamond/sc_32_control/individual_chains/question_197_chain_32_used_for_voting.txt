Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So wait, that means Compound X must have a ketone group because Clemmensen reduces ketones, right?

Looking at the data provided: the IR and NMR spectra. I'll start by analyzing the IR. The IR peaks can give me information about functional groups. The peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. But wait, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might suggest some conjugation, perhaps aromatic rings because those are typical for C=C stretching. The broad peak between 3400–2500 cm-1 is probably an -OH stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid? Wait, but wait—if it's a ketone, that broad peak isn't likely. Or maybe it's an alcohol? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the 3400–2500 is due to an alkyne or an amine, but those don't fit with the other data.

Wait, maybe I should check the NMR as well. In the 1H NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's really high, which suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10. But wait, could it be an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid? Oh, the broad peak could be from an -OH group in a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the IR, a carboxylic acid would have a strong broad O-H stretch around 2500–3300 cm-1, which is in that range. But the IR data shows 3400–2500, which includes the O-H stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid then. But wait, if that's the case, what about the 1720 cm-1? That peak could be a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester. But a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So maybe the compound has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group? That seems a bit unusual, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the NMR again, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but an aldehyde proton is typically a triplet or a quartet if it's adjacent to a CH2, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic OH, but phenols usually have O-H stretches around 5-7 ppm in the IR, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, in the IR, if it's an -OH of a carboxylic acid, it would be a broad peak around 2500-3000 cm-1. So combining that with the 1720 peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, the IR also shows peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ring with substituents, one of which is a ketone or a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the NMR shifts: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, and they're probably para to each other. So perhaps the aromatic ring is something like p-xylene, but with substituents.

The other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's probably a CH adjacent to something, maybe a CH next to a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps two CH2 groups. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – that looks like a CH(CH3) group, maybe a branch. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal CH3, which is usually from an ethyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain leading to a ketone or another functional group. Let's think: The IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, but if Compound X has a ketone, then when it undergoes Clemmensen reduction, the ketone would be reduced to a methylene group (CH2). So the product would have a CH2 where the ketone was.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what they are. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So the options are various substituted benzene rings with substituents. Option C is a benzoic acid (so a COOH group at position 4, and a sec-butyl group? Wait, no, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1, and the sec-butyl at position 4.

Wait, let me think about the starting material. The NMR of Compound X: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which if it's a carboxylic acid, would be the -OH proton. But wait, if it's a ketone, then the IR 1720 cm-1 would make sense, but the broad peak in NMR would have to be something else. Alternatively, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually less broad, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's re-examine the NMR. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. But why is it a broad signal? Maybe it's exchanging with water, which is why it's broad. So perhaps the compound X has an aldehyde group.

But wait, then the IR: the 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl from somewhere else. Maybe an ester or a ketone. Hmm, but if it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 2800 (stretch for aldehyde C-H) and around 1700 for the carbonyl. Wait, but I don't see a peak at 2800 in the IR data. The IR given is 3400–2500, which is a broad region. But aldehydes have a strong absorption around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 (the C-H stretch in the aldehyde). The given IR doesn't have those peaks, so perhaps it's not an aldehyde.

So maybe the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid. Then the IR would have a broad O-H around 2500, which fits. The 1720 would be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, but it can be higher. So that could fit.

So the NMR has a 10.5 ppm (OH, carboxylic acid), aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests a para-substituted ring. Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m,1H) – maybe a CH next to a carbonyl. 1.7 ppm (m,2H) – perhaps adjacent CH2 groups. 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH(CH3) group, and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3, so ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group and an ethyl branch. Let me think: maybe the substituent is a propionoic acid, but that's not matching the substituents.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options. Let's see each option.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The structure would be:

Ph-COOH with a sec-butyl group para to it.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So the substituents are at the para positions. So if the benzene ring has two substituents, perhaps a COOH and another group. Wait, but in option C, it's only the COOH and the sec-butyl. So in that case, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4, making them para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets because of the substituents.

Wait, but the NMR shows 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So that's two sets of two protons each, each as a doublet. That suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. So in option C, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So the ring would have two substituents, and the protons would be on carbons 2 and 6 (if the substituents are at 1 and 4), but wait, no. Wait, benzene is a ring, so substituents at 1 and 4 are actually meta to each other, but wait no, 1 and 4 are across from each other, so para.

Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are across from each other, so that's para. So the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So the ring would have two substituents, each at the para positions.

So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But wait, if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then the adjacent positions would be 2 and 6 (to substituent 1) and 3 and 5 (to substituent 4). Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the ring would look like substituents at 1 and 4, but that would actually make them adjacent to each other in a different way. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the benzene has one substituent, and the other substituent is on a branch.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain leading to a carbonyl group. Let's think about the NMR signals: 10.5 ppm (OH, maybe for COOH), 8.0 and 7.2 (aromatic), then the other signals suggest a chain.

Wait, the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H) – perhaps a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm (m,2H) – maybe two CH2 groups. 1.4 ppm (d,3H) – a CH(CH3). 0.9 ppm (t,3H) – an ethyl group.

Putting this all together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)OH group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a propionic acid group. But wait, the substituent would be at the para position.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH(CH3), as a doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. So that would be a CH(CH3) group attached to another group. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps an ethyl chain.

So maybe the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, let's try to piece this together. The NMR tells us:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad): likely a carboxylic acid -OH.

- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.

- 2.9 (m,1H): possibly a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 (m,2H): two CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to each other.

- 1.4 (d,3H): a CH(CH3) group.

- 0.9 (t,3H): terminal CH3.

So the substituent on the benzene is a chain that looks like perhaps CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH?

Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that fits. Then the chain would be benzene-(CH2)n-COOH.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH next to the carbonyl. Then the 1.7 (m,2H) would be CH2-CH2, and the 1.4 (d,3H) is a CH(CH3), and the 0.9 (t,3H) is an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Hmm, but that may not fit. Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituents are para to each other.

In that case, the substituent on the benzene would be a COOH and a sec-butyl group. So the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the given data.

What about the other signals?

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H): that would be the CH in the sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Let me think: butyl groups. The four carbons in a butyl can be arranged as:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2-.

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait: the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ? Wait, no. Wait, the correct IUPAC structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the butyl groups are:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2-.

sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The correct structure for the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be a four-carbon chain with a branch. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think of the sec-butyl group as CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-COOH group attached to the benzene. But in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 next to the COOH.

Wait, but the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) suggests a CH next to something. Maybe that's the CH in the substituent.

Wait, let me think about the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C). The benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 (assuming numbering starts at the COOH), and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent is a -COOH and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but wait, no. The substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Or is it a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group?

Wait, the correct structure of the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's not matching the options.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is probably a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a CH2-C(O)OH group. But then, in that case, the CH2 would be adjacent to the COOH. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-COOH, which would make the substituent a propanoic acid group. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH group and a sec-butyl substituent.

In that structure, the substituent on the benzene would be a -COOH and a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Or is it -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-?

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon group with a branch. Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But that would be a iso-butyl group, not a sec-butyl. So I might be getting this wrong.

But regardless, the key point is that when Compound X is treated with red phosphorus and HI (Clemmensen reduction), the ketone is reduced to a methylene group. Wait, but if the starting material has a ketone, then after reduction, it becomes a CH2 group. So the product would have a CH2 in place of the ketone.

Wait, but the options don't seem to involve ketones. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a benzophenone derivative. But given the NMR, perhaps it's a substituted acetophenone.

Wait, if the starting material has a ketone, then the product would have a CH2 group. So for example, if the starting material is acetophenone with some substituents, the product would be toluene with substituents.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're all substituted benzene rings. So perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone (a ketone attached to a benzene), and the product is the corresponding alkane.

Wait, but the NMR of the starting material shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which is way up, perhaps a carbonyl proton, but that's not possible. Because ketones don't have protons on the carbonyl. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cinnamic acid derivative. The IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde and a ketone. But that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a ketone. So for example, benzene-CH2-C(O)R. Let's think about that.

So, the 1720 cm^-1 would be the ketone. The 10.5 ppm in the NMR could be an aldehyde proton, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a COOH group; but that would require another peak in the IR for the O-H stretch.

Wait, the IR has 3400–2500 cm-1, which includes the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative with a ketone substituent. But that seems unlikely, as the same molecule would have both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes an aldehyde group. But that seems complicated.

An alternative approach: let's consider the reaction. Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to CH2 groups. So the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

Looking at the options, which are all substituted benzene rings, perhaps the starting material was a benzophenone with a substituent that includes a ketone.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is benzalacetophenone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a ketone group, like CH2-C(O)-R.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data again. The signals after the aromatic region:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH(CH3).

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal CH3.

So this looks like a chain: CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a pentyl group? No, the chain is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but wait, the 2.9 is a single CH, then 1.7 is two CH2 groups, and then the 1.4 is a CH(CH3), and 0.9 is a terminal CH3.

So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which would be a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, but that doesn’t seem to fit.

Alternatively, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to a benzene ring, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group. Because the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is a CH(CH3) group. And the 2.9 ppm is a m (multiplet) for a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure. Let's say the substituent on benzene is a -CH2-C(O)R group.

But perhaps it's better to think about the options. Let's consider option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In this structure, the benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group attached via the second carbon. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no. Let me think correctly: butyl groups have four carbons. The substituent is attached to the ring via the first carbon. For a sec-butyl group, the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a butane chain. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that would be five carbons. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the substituent as:

Ph-CH2-CO-OH is for a propanoic acid, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, let's think about the reaction again. Clemmensen reduction converts ketones to CH2 groups. So if Compound X is a ketone, the product would have a CH2 where the ketone was.

Looking at the options, all are substituted benzene rings without any ketone. So perhaps the starting material has a ketone group attached to the benzene, and after reduction, it becomes a CH2 group.

So for example, if the starting material is benzophenone (Ph-C(O)-Ph), but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 4-phenylpentan-2-one. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a benzene ring with a propionyl group (CH2-C(O)-R). So the substituent is CH2-C(O)-R.

Wait, but after reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH2 group, so the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-R.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is the product. Because option C is a benzoic acid, which would imply that the starting material had a ketone that was part of a chain leading to a COOH group. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the NMR data again. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 1H, which suggests a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are para-substituted. The other signals suggest a chain of some sort: a CH, two CH2 groups, a CH(CH3), and a terminal CH3.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group, which is a pentyl group. But that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but that would be a butyl group.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is a isopropyl group. The NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d,3H) which is a CH(CH3), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3. But how would that fit?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that would require more carbons.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: carboxylic acid -OH.

- 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H): para-substituted aromatic.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): maybe a CH next to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH(CH3).

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): CH2CH3.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. That would be a pentyl group, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, looking at option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group at position 4 and a methyl group at position 1. Wait, but the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which suggests a functional group like COOH, which is not present in option B.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, no functional group like COOH.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have a COOH group and a phenyl group attached. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a ketone substituent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a 1720 cm^-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So that's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Since the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which is very high, perhaps it's an aldehyde. But then the 1720 would be the aldehyde's C=O. But aldehydes typically have a C-H stretch around 2800 cm^-1, which isn't in the given IR data. So that's conflicting.

So perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid -OH. The 1720 would then be the C=O of the carboxylic acid, but then the IR's O-H stretch would be around 2500-3000, which is in the 3400–2500 range. So that makes sense.

So the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative. Then, when treated with red phosphorus and HI (Clemmensen), what happens? Wait, Clemmensen is for ketones, not carboxylic acids. So that's confusing because if the starting material has a carboxylic acid, the Clemmensen wouldn't affect that. Hmm, unless there's a ketone as well.

Wait, no. Perhaps the starting material has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. But that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a substituted benzaldehyde with a ketone elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a ketone in a side chain. Let me think: benzene-CH2-C(O)-R. So when the ketone is reduced, the CH2-C(O)-R becomes CH2-CH2-R. So the product would have a CH2-CH2-R group.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was a benzophenone with a propyl group that included a ketone. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a ketone. For example, benzophenone. But in that case, the NMR wouldn't have the 10.5 ppm peak.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the reaction again. Clemmensen reduction is used to reduce ketones to alkanes. It doesn't affect carboxylic acids because they are not ketones. So if the starting material had a ketone, the product would have a CH2 group in place of the ketone. But if the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative with a ketone, then the ketone would be reduced, leaving the carboxylic acid intact.

But in the options, all the products are simple substituted benzene rings without any ketones. So perhaps the starting material's ketone is part of a side chain, leading to a COOH group.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propionyl group (CH2-C(O)-R). Then, upon Clemmensen reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH2, making the substituent CH2-CH2-R.

In this case, R would be a methyl group or something else. But without knowing R, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-C(O)-CH2CH3 group. Then, after reduction, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, which is a butyl group.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So the substituents are isobutyl and methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cinnamic acid derivative.

Wait, another idea: the starting material has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a ketone and a propionoic acid group. So, for example, benzene-CH2-C(O)-CH2-COOH. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-phenylbutan-2-one. So, the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Then, upon Clemmensen reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes CH2, so the product would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just a butyl benzene, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to match the NMR data to the options.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Because substituents are at 1 and 4. So the H's on carbons 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH group, and those on 3 and 5 adjacent to the sec-butyl.

The aromatic H's would be two doublets, which matches the NMR data.

The substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is:

- The substituent is attached to the benzene at the first carbon of the butyl group.

- The butyl group is arranged as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)CH2-. Hmm, but that would be a four-carbon group, right?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. But that would be an iso-butyl group, not a sec-butyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the substituent structures. Let me clarify:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2-.

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, that's not correct because the substituent is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene ring.

In this case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH(CH3) group. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), suggesting a CH(CH3) group. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So the structure is:

Phenyl group attached to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon group, but the substituent is attached to the benzene via the first carbon. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but then the end of the substituent is a CH2 group. But the NMR has a 0.9 ppm (t,3H), which is a terminal CH3. So that would fit if the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a four-carbon group, but that would be a butyl group attached in a certain way.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group because the benzene is attached to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is four carbons, making the substituent a butyl group. Hmm, no, that's four carbons in the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group. The NMR shows a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which would be the CH(CH3) in an isopropyl group.

But the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a terminal CH3, which doesn't fit the isopropyl group. So perhaps it's a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a propyl group, so CH2-CH2-CH3. But the NMR has a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a CH(CH3). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is (CH3)2CHCH2-, which would have a CH(CH3)2 group. The NMR for that would show a septet for the CH(CH3)2, but in the given data, it's a doublet, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. The end of the chain is a CH2 group, but the NMR shows a terminal CH3. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a CH(CH3) in the middle. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would make it a pentyl group, but the NMR shows a 0.9 ppm (t,3H) which is a terminal CH3. That would fit a propyl group, but the substituent would then be longer.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to match the options based on the reaction.

The reaction is Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to CH2 groups. So the starting material must have a ketone, and the product will have a CH2 group where the ketone was.

Looking at the options, all are substituted benzene rings. So the starting material probably had a benzene ring with a ketone substituent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was a acetophenone derivative. So, benzene-CH2-C(O)-R. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH2, so the product is benzene-CH2-CH2-R.

But none of the options show a CH2-CH2-R group. So perhaps the starting material had a more complex substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a ketone, like benzene-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH2, so the product is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is ethylbenzene. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a benzalacetophenone. Wait, that would be benzophenone with an aldehyde group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a -CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2 group. Then, upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH2, making it -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. How would that form?

If the starting material was 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, then upon reduction, the ketone would be reduced to a CH2 group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl methylbenzene? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes a COOH group. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the IR and NMR data again. The IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1, which is a ketone or a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely a carboxylic acid -OH. So the starting material must have both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. But that seems unusual.

Wait, but in that case, the Clemmensen reduction would only affect the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid intact. So the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was, and the carboxylic acid would remain.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. So perhaps the starting material was a benzophenone with a carboxylic acid substituent. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH2, but the carboxylic acid remains.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a ketone and a carboxylic acid. But that seems complicated.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes a ketone. But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cinnamic acid derivative, which has a conjugated double bond and a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes an aldehyde group. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propionoic acid group. So the substituent is CH2-COOH. Then, the ketone is part of a chain. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the starting material's substituent is a propionoic acid. So the substituent is CH2-COOH. The IR would show the carbonyl of the acid around 1700 cm^-1, which fits with the 1720. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the CH2-COOH would have a triplet around 4 ppm, but that's not present in the NMR data provided.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)-OCH2CH3 group, making it an ester. But then the IR would have a peak around 1720, which could fit an ester. But the NMR would show an OCH2CH3 group, which isn't present.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think of the options and see which one fits the product after Clemmensen reduction.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material had a ketone in the substituent, the reduction would change that to a CH2 group. So perhaps the starting material was 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, but that would reduce to 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group.

But option C is a benzoic acid, so the reaction must have introduced the COOH group.

Wait, no. Clemmensen reduction doesn't add functional groups; it reduces ketones. So the starting material must have had a ketone, and the product would have a CH2 in that position. But option C has a COOH group, which suggests that the starting material had a COOH group and a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes both a ketone and a COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-phenylbutan-2-one. Structure: benzene-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH2, so the product would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is ethylbenzene. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-(propioloyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2 group. Upon reduction, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2, which would be a iso-butyl group. Wait, but that would form a product with a CH2-CH2- group, which isn't present in the options.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe it's better to go with the data and the options.

The IR indicates a carboxylic acid (O-H and C=O) and a ketone (C=O). Wait, but the IR only shows one C=O peak at 1720 cm^-1. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. Hmm.

If the starting material is a benzoic acid, then the reaction with Clemmensen wouldn't affect it, because Clemmensen reduces ketones. So the product would be the same as the starting material. But that's not possible because the options are different structures.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a ketone in a side chain. So, for example, the substituent is CH2-C(O)-R. Upon reduction, it becomes CH2-CH2-R.

Looking at the options, option C has a sec-butyl group. So if R were a CH(CH3) group, then the substituent would become a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material had a side chain with a ketone, and upon reduction, it becomes a longer chain.

But I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to guess based on the data.

The NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which is a carboxylic acid -OH. The IR has 1720 cm^-1, which is the C=O of the carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are para-substituted. The other signals suggest a chain with a CH, two CH2 groups, a CH(CH3), and a terminal CH3. So the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group, which is a pentyl group, but that's not matching any options.

Wait, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would have a isobutyl group and a methyl group para to each other. The substituent is a isobutyl group, which would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)2. The NMR would show a triplet around 1.0 ppm for the terminal CH3, and a septet for the CH(CH3)2, but the given NMR doesn't have that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, putting it all together, the starting material was a benzophenone with a substituent that included a ketone and a COOH group. Upon reduction, the ketone became a CH2, but the COOH remained. The product is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes while leaving other functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, unaffected. The IR and NMR data provided suggest the following:

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong C=O stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or a ketone.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid -OH proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet integrating to 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet integrating to 2H, likely two adjacent CH₂ groups.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH(CH₃) group.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, consistent with a terminal CH₃ group (e.g., from an ethyl chain).

### Key Observations:
1. The **10.5 ppm** peak and the IR data strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
2. The **1720 cm⁻¹** IR peak supports the presence of a carbonyl group, which could belong to the carboxylic acid.
3. The aromatic protons at **8.0 ppm** and **7.2 ppm** indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
4. The NMR signals at **2.9 ppm**, **1.7 ppm**, **1.4 ppm**, and **0.9 ppm** suggest a chain structure attached to the benzene ring, likely a branched alkyl group.

### Reaction Analysis:
The Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. However, the presence of a carboxylic acid in the starting material (as indicated by the IR and NMR data) suggests that the reduction does not affect the carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the product will retain the carboxylic acid group and any alkyl substituents.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group indicated by the signals at **1.4 ppm** and **0.9 ppm**.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: This structure matches the data well. The para-substituted benzene ring explains the aromatic NMR signals, and the sec-butyl group explains the signals at **1.4 ppm** (CH(CH₃)) and **0.9 ppm** (terminal CH₃). The carboxylic acid group accounts for the IR and NMR signals at **10.5 ppm** and **1720 cm⁻¹**.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent product with the given IR, NMR data, and the reaction conditions is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
