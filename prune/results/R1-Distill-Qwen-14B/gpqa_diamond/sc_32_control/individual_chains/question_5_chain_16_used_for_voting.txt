Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator is given as P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The question gives the components Px, Py, and Pz as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I think I should start by recalling that any vector in the x-z plane would have direction angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or maybe π/2? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is where the angle φ is 0 or π because it's the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. Hmm, but the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so maybe it's better to write the operator P in terms of n. 

So the operator P would be the component in the direction of n. So if n is a unit vector, then P = n · σ · (ħ/2), where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. Oh wait, but the operator is given as components in x, y, z. So the total operator is P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, but scaled by ħ/2. 

Wait, the problem states that Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix, same for Py and Pz. So the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the given P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

But wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. So n is a unit vector in x-z plane, which can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but since it's in x-z, φ is 0 or maybe some angle. Wait, no, in x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal) is 0 because it's along the x and z axes. Wait, actually, the direction in x-z plane can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because when φ is zero, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is between 0 and π. 

So the operator P is given by (ħ/2) (n · σ) = (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ). Because the y-component of n is zero.

So the operator becomes P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ]

Let me write down the matrix for this. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:

sinθ σ_x = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ σ_z = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
So adding them together:
[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by ħ/2, so the matrix P is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So let's set up the eigenvalue equation: P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So substituting P:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate constants:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

[cosθ a + sinθ b = a]
[sinθ a - cosθ b = b]

Let me rearrange each equation.

First equation: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0.
Second equation: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

Hmm, so we have two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second equation. Let me check: the second equation is sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b → sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0.

So now, I can write this as a system:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

We can write this in matrix form:

[ (cosθ -1)    sinθ         ] [a]   = 0
[   sinθ     -(cosθ +1) ] [b]

Since the system has non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. Let me compute the determinant:

Determinant D = (cosθ -1)(-(cosθ +1)) - (sinθ)(sinθ)
= -(cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) - sin²θ
= -(cos²θ -1) - sin²θ
= -(cos²θ - sin²θ -1) → wait, let me compute each term.

First term: (cosθ-1)(- (cosθ +1)) = -(cosθ-1)(cosθ +1) = -(cos²θ -1) = -cos²θ +1

Second term: - (sinθ * sinθ) because determinant is (a*d - b*c), so it's (cosθ-1)*(-(cosθ+1)) - sinθ * sinθ.

So D = (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ.

We can simplify D: 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ, so D = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. So determinant is zero, which means the equations are dependent, which makes sense since we're looking for eigenvectors.

So now, we can take either equation to find the relation between a and b.

Looking at equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → (a)/(b) = [sinθ]/[1 - cosθ]

Wait, but 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

a/b = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ) = [cos(theta/2)] / [sin(theta/2)] = cot(theta/2)

So a = b cot(theta/2) → a = b (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) → a = b [cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)]

Alternatively, a = b [cot(theta/2)].

So let's let b be a parameter, say b = k. Then a = k cot(theta/2).

But wait, let me express a in terms of b. Alternatively, perhaps express the eigenvector in terms of a ratio.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [a, b] = [cot(theta/2), 1], but scaled by some constant. Wait, not exactly, because if a = b cot(theta/2), then the vector would be [cot(theta/2) * b, b] = b [cot(theta/2), 1]

So the eigenvector can be written as [cot(theta/2), 1] multiplied by a scalar. Alternatively, to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

Wait, but let's find the components in terms of sin and cos. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of theta/2.

Wait, another approach: Let me write a = [something], b = [something else]. Let me pick b as 1, then a would be cot(theta/2). So the vector is [cot(theta/2), 1].

But let me compute the normalization. The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1.

Cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so |cot(theta/2)|^2 = [cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2)] / sin²(theta/2) → no, wait, no, because |cot(theta/2)|^2 = [cos²(theta/2)] / [sin²(theta/2)].

So normalization factor N is sqrt( [cos²(theta/2)/ sin²(theta/2)] + 1 ) = sqrt( [cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2)] / sin²(theta/2) ) ) → sqrt( 1 / sin²(theta/2) ) ) = 1/|sin(theta/2)|.

Assuming sin(theta/2) is positive, since theta is between 0 and pi, theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, so sin(theta/2) is positive. So N = 1/sin(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * N , N ] = [ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) * (1/sin(theta/2)), 1/sin(theta/2) ) ]

Simplify:

First component: cos(theta/2) / [sin^2(theta/2)] → cos(theta/2) / sin^2(theta/2)
Second component: 1/sin(theta/2)

But wait, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to write this.

Alternatively, perhaps express the eigenvector in terms of sine and cosine of theta/2.

Wait, another approach: Let me use the parameterization of the eigenvector.

Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps the state corresponds to spin-up in the n direction. So the spin state is |+n>, which for a spin-1/2 system is given by a certain vector.

But I'm not exactly recalling the formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the standard formula for eigenstates.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of S·n are |+> and |->, where |+> is (1,0) in the direction of n. Wait, no, that's for the z-direction. For an arbitrary direction, it's more involved.

Wait, another approach: let me express the operator P as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices in the direction n. So P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

In this problem, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y =0.

So P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

Given n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Since it's in x-z plane, n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P becomes (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z )

Which is the same as earlier.

The eigenstates of P are the same as the eigenstates of σ·n, because P is proportional to σ·n.

The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, as given.

The eigenvectors for spin-up (eigenvalue +ħ/2) can be found as follows.

The general formula for spin-up in direction (θ, φ) is:

|+n> = [ e^{-iφ/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) ]^T

But in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane (phi=0 for direction in x-z plane).

So phi is 0, so e^{-i phi/2} = 1, e^{i phi/2} =1.

So the eigenvector simplifies to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, wait. Let me check:

The general spin-up state along direction (θ, φ) is:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

In our case, since phi is 0, it becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. But wait, phi is the angle around the z-axis. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0, so e^{i phi} =1.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. But wait, this is only when the direction is (theta, phi=0). So that would be correct.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we found [a, b] proportional to [cot(theta/2), 1], but this seems different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's see. Let me compute [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] and see if it satisfies the eigenvector equation.

So let me call this vector v = [c, s], where c = cos(theta/2), s= sin(theta/2).

So let's compute P v:

P is (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So P v is (ħ/2) [ cosθ * c + sinθ * s, sinθ * c + (-cosθ) * s ]

We need this to equal (ħ/2) [c, s].

So let's compute each component.

First component:

cosθ * c + sinθ * s = ?

Express cosθ and sinθ in terms of theta/2:

cosθ = cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = (1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2)) → Wait, maybe it's easier to use identities.

Alternatively, cosθ = 1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1.

Hmm, perhaps expanding cos(theta) * cos(theta/2) + sin(theta) * sin(theta/2):

cos(theta) cos(theta/2) + sin(theta) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta - theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

Because cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB.

So first component becomes cos(theta/2).

Similarly, second component:

sin(theta) c + (-cos(theta)) s = sin(theta) cos(theta/2) - cos(theta) sin(theta/2)

= sin(theta - theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

Because sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB.

So P v = (ħ/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] = (ħ/2) v.

Which is correct, as v is the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, looking at the options given:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without considering normalization. Wait, wait, no. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But I think the vectors are normalized already because cos^2 + sin^2 =1. So option C looks correct.

Wait, but looking back, the eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. So each component is just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is already normalized.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this.

But wait, let me check option D: [sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)]. That includes hbar, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector because eigenvectors are usually written as unit vectors. So option D probably isn't the right choice.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to be for a different parameterization, perhaps when the angle is theta from the x-axis or something else. But our eigenvector is in terms of theta/2.

Option A has hbar in the components, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector.

Option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ can be expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\vec{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma}) = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z).
\]

Substituting the Pauli matrices:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

we find:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \\
\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From these equations, the ratio of $a$ to $b$ is determined to be:

\[
\frac{a}{b} = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize this vector, we compute the normalization factor:

\[
\sqrt{\left|\cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right|^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
\]

The normalized eigenvector is then:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of option C, which is:

\[
\left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right).
\]

The other options are incorrect because:
- Option A includes $\hbar$, which is not part of a normalized eigenvector.
- Option B corresponds to a different parameterization, likely involving spherical coordinates with $\phi \neq 0$.
- Option D introduces unnecessary scaling factors and includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with normalization.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
