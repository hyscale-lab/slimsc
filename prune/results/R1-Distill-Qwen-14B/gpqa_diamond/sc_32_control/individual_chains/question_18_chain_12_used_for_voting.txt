Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. The question gives some abundance ratios for these stars. I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, like [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], I think.

Wait, the problem statement says the elemental abundances were determined using the EW method under LTE. I remember that LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which is an assumption that the gas in the star's atmosphere is in equilibrium. The EW method refers to measuring equivalent widths of absorption lines to determine element abundances. But I'm not too clear on the specifics, but maybe I don't need that for this problem.

The given abundances are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere composition is given as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → around 3.16e-5?

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, the notation is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. Oh wait, no, actually the notation is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for [Fe/H], it's log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So in the Sun, it's given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH)_sun is 7.5 -12? Wait that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I misinterpret that.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12=-5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → which is log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe/nH)_1 = same as sun. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun: 3.16e-5.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 for Star_2 → log(nMg/nH)_2 = same as Sun → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Now, for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Wait, but what is the Sun's [Si/Fe]? Let me think. The Sun's photosphere, so for the Sun, nSi/nFe = (nSi)/(nFe). But what's nSi in the Sun? Hmm, I don't have that value given. Wait, but maybe I can calculate it using the given data.

Wait, in the Sun, for nMg/nH =1e-5, and nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

Wait, but I don't have nSi for the Sun. Hmm, perhaps I can find it by using the given [Mg/Si]_2. Wait, no, [Mg/Si]_2 is given for Star_2, which is 0.3. So maybe that's not helpful directly.

Wait, let me think. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun +0.3.

But wait, for the Sun, nMg/nSi is a certain value. So perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio, which would be [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Then for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/Si]_sun + 0.3.

Hmm, but I don't have the Sun's [Mg/Si], but maybe I can compute it. Let's see.

In the Sun:

nMg = 1e-5 * nH (since nMg/nH = 1e-5)
nFe =3.16e-5 * nH

But I need nSi to find [Mg/Si] for the Sun.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi in terms of other elements. Or, maybe I can proceed without knowing nSi for the Sun by using the given ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem using the given data for each star.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed to express the required ratio [Si_1 / Si_2] as the ratio of (nSi in Star_1)/(nSi in Star_2).

Wait, but the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that would be (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = ?

Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen ratios? Or perhaps their silicon to some other element, but I think it's the number of silicon atoms, so nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait, but the problem says, 'the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.' So that's nSi_1 / nSi_2.

To find this ratio, perhaps I can express each nSi in terms of another element, say Fe or Mg, and then relate them.

Hmm, let's think about Star_1 first.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^(log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3) = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can write it as nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) + 0.3.

So, nMg_2 = nSi_2 * 10^(log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3) =nSi_2 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Hmm, but I don't have nMg_sun or nSi_sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH and then find the ratio.

Wait, for Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

Similarly, nH_1 could be anything, but perhaps it doesn't matter because we take the ratio of nSi_1 and nSi_2, and the nH terms would cancel.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write nSi in terms of nFe and other constants.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars' photospheres, but I don't think that's valid. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio can be expressed in terms of the Sun's ratios, because the stars have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] zero, meaning their Fe and Mg are the same as the Sun's.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is zero. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → which means nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 is zero → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

[Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 → nMg_2 /nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

So, nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3*(nMg_sun /nSi_sun)).

But nMg_2 is nMg_sun*(nH_2/nH_sun).

So substituting:

nSi_2 = [nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun)] / [10^0.3*(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)].

Simplifying: nSi_2 = (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3).

Now, let's write nSi_1 and nSi_2 expressions.

nSi_1 = [nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun)] * (10^0.3) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) → because nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

So, nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun).

Similarly, nSi_2 = (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3).

So, the ratio:

nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [ (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun) ) ] / [ (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (nH_1) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun ] / [ (nH_2) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3) ) ]

nSi_sun cancels out:

= [ nH_1 * 10^0.3 ] / [ nH_2 * (1/10^0.3) ) ]

Multiply denominator denominator:

= nH_1 * 10^0.3 * 10^0.3 / nH_2

= nH_1 / nH_2 * 10^(0.6)

So, the ratio is (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^(0.6).

Hmm, but I don't know nH_1 and nH_2. Is there a way to relate the hydrogen densities?

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The stars have different masses, but I'm not sure if that affects the hydrogen density in their photospheres. Hmm, perhaps not directly, because the photosphere's composition is given, but the mass might relate to the overall size or gravity, which can affect the scale of the photosphere, but maybe not the density.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 'elemental abundances' are determined. So perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, meaning that the stars have the same abundance of Fe and Mg as the Sun. Hmm, but that's for the photosphere—maybe the overall mass doesn't affect the photospheric composition, just the abundance ratios.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio nH_1 /nH_2 in terms of the stars' other abundances. But I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the ratio is just 10^0.6, which is about 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.98. Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, option D is ~1.2.

Wait, but wait. That would be the case if (nH_1/nH_2) is 1, right? Because then nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

But why would (nH_1/nH_2) be 1? Are the stars' hydrogen densities the same?

Hmm, the problem doesn't provide any information about the stars' hydrogen densities, so perhaps that term is 1, making the ratio 10^0.6.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again about the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1=0, which is log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1.

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

We can write nH_1 = nFe_1 * (nH_sun /nFe_sun).

Similarly, nH_2 = nMg_2 * (nH_sun /nMg_sun).

But I'm not sure how that helps with the nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed by assuming that the overall number of hydrogen atoms in each star's photosphere is the same, but that's probably not a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nH_1/nH_2) can be found from other information.

Wait, but wait, maybe I can relate the hydrogen densities via the stellar parameters, like their masses. But the mass of the star might not directly affect the photosphere's hydrogen density because the photosphere is the outer layer, and the star's overall mass would influence the overall size, but unless the radius is given, which it isn't, I can't proceed that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the hydrogen densities would just cancel out because the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, implying nFe and nMg are the same as the Sun's.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the stars' nH in terms of their own abundances.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

But I don't see how to connect nH_1 and nH_2 without more information.

Wait, perhaps I can express the nH in terms of another element's abundance.

Wait, let's think again about the expressions for nSi_1 and nSi_2.

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3.

So the ratio is:

nSi_1/nSi_2 = [ (nH_1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun ] / [ (nH_2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun /10^0.3 } ]

The nSi_sun and nH_sun terms cancel out.

= (nH_1 * 10^0.3) / (nH_2 * (1/10^0.3) )) )

This simplifies to (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^(0.3 +0.3 ) = (nH_1/nH_2) * 10^0.6.

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the stars are in LTE, which allows for certain assumptions about their atmospheres. But without more data, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the hydrogen densities is 1, so the ratio is 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98, so option A.

But why would nH_1/nH_2 be 1? That would be the case only if the hydrogen density is the same in both stars, which I don't think is a given.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_2) using their given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0. So nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

Now, considering that, I can write nH_1 = (nFe_1 * nH_sun) /nFe_sun.

nH_2 = (nMg_2 *nH_sun)/nMg_sun.

So, the ratio nH_1/nH_2 = (nFe_1 /nMg_2) * (nMg_sun /nFe_sun).

But I don't have nFe_1 or nMg_2. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can think about the mass of the stars. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But I'm not sure how that relates to their photospheric hydrogen density.

Wait, but perhaps the mass relates to the amount of hydrogen they have overall, but the photosphere is a thin layer, so maybe the photospheric hydrogen density depends on the star's structure, which I don't have info on.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about Star_1 and Star_2's abundances in terms of the Sun.

Star_1:

[Fe/H] =0 → Fe abundance same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]=0.3 → Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1 /nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Similarly, Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg_2 /nSi_2 =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

I'm trying to find nSi_1/nSi_2.

Let me express both nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of another element.

For Star_1:

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

For Star_2:

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)).

So, nSi_1/nSi_2 = [nFe_1 *10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)] / [nMg_2/(10^0.3 (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)))].

Hmm, that simplifies to [nFe_1 *10^0.3 * nSi_sun /nFe_sun] * [nMg_2 * nSi_sun / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3) ) ].

Wait, that seems messy. Let me write it step by step.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / [10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ].

So, nSi_1/nSi_2 = [nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun)] / [nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)) ) ].

Which can be rewritten as:

(nFe_1 / nMg_2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )

Simplify:

(nFe_1 /nMg_2) * 10^0.6 * (nMg_sun /nFe_sun) )

But I don't know nFe_1 or nMg_2.

Hmm, perhaps I can relate nFe_1 and nMg_2 using the stars' masses. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but without knowing their radii or other parameters, I can't find their densities, which are needed to find nH.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass doesn't affect the photospheric composition, so the ratio depends only on the given abundances, which would lead to the ratio being 10^0.6, which is ~3.98. So the answer would be option A.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is 10^0.3 /10^0.3 which is 1. Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, another way: since [Fe/H]_1 is zero, Star_1's Fe is the same as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2's Mg is the same as the Sun's. So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so Si is 10^0.3 times higher relative to Fe than the Sun. For Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3, so Mg is 10^0.3 times higher relative to Si than the Sun.

Wait, so let's consider the Sun's [Mg/Si]. The Sun's [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

If I can compute that, perhaps I can find the ratio.

Given that in the Sun:

nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

nMg = 1e-5 *nH_sun.

But what about nSi?

Hmm, I don't have nSi for the Sun. But perhaps I can relate it via the solar abundances.

Wait, perhaps I can look up the solar abundance ratios. Oh wait, but the problem gives us the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. It doesn't give [Si/Fe] or [Mg/Si] for the Sun. So I have to proceed without that.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Mg/Si] for Star_2 as 0.3. So in Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3 higher than the Sun's [Mg/Si].

So, nMg_2 /nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

So, from that, nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)).

But I don't know nMg_sun or nSi_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) from the Sun's data. Let's see.

In the Sun, nMg =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nFe=3.16e-5 *nH_sun.

But I don't have nSi. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find [Mg/Si]_sun.

[Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

But without knowing nSi_sun, I can't find this. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can model the Sun's abundance as a reference.

Let me think: I have for the Sun:

nFe/nH =3.16e-5 → [Fe/H]_sun =0.

nMg/nH =1e-5 → [Mg/H]_sun=0.

But I don't have nSi for the Sun, but maybe I can express it in terms of nFe and nMg.

Wait, perhaps the solar composition includes some standard ratios, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that nH is the same in both stars, which would make nH_1 /nH_2 =1, leading to a ratio of 10^0.6, which is ~3.98, option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of Si is determined by the product of the ratios relative to another element.

In Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3.

In Star_2, [Mg/Si] =0.3 → Mg/Si = 10^0.3.

So, in Star_2, Mg is 10^0.3 times Si.

But in the Sun, the Mg/Si ratio is a certain value. Let's call that X.

So, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] = X +0.3.

Hmm, but without knowing X, I can't proceed. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the problem is only about comparing the two stars' Si relative to each other, without needing the Sun's Si.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of their own compositions.

Wait, but I don't have enough information. Maybe I'm missing a key point.

Wait, the problem gives [Fe/H]_1=0, which means Fe in Star_1 is same as Sun. [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg in Star_2 is same as Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3 → which is higher than the Sun's.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3 → nMg_2 = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

But nMg_2 is also nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So, nSi_2 = (nMg_2/(10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)) )) → nSi_2 = (nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) ) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / (10^0.3) )

Similarly, nSi_1 = (nH_1/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 is:

[ (nH_1/nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2/nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3 ]

nSi_sun and nH_sun cancel out.

= (nH_1/nH_2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) ) 

= (nH_1/nH_2) * 10^0.6

Hmm, but without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero implies that their overall heavy element abundances are the same as the Sun, but their H may vary.

Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is zero, Fe/H is same as Sun.

So in Star_1, (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → nFe_1 /nH_1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, in Star_2, (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun → nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But I don't see how to relate nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the total number of atoms in the photosphere is the same for both stars. But that's an assumption, and I don't think it's given.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the star affects the photospheric hydrogen density, but without knowing the radius or surface gravity, I can't find that.

Hmm, perhaps the question expects me to proceed under the assumption that (nH_1 /nH_2) =1, leading to the ratio being 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which would be option A.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's the intended approach. So the answer would be approximately 3.9, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition as a reference.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - Mass: 1.5 times the Sun.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: Si is \(10^{0.3} \approx 1.995\) times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass: 1.2 times the Sun.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: Mg is \(10^{0.3} \approx 1.995\) times more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \implies n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5}\).
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \implies n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5}\).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies \(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}\) in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun: \(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5}\).
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies \(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 1.995\) times the solar ratio. Thus:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}} = n_{\text{Fe}} \cdot 1.995.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies \(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}\) in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun: \(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5}\).
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies \(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 1.995\) times the solar ratio. Thus:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}} = n_{\text{Mg}} / 1.995.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
To find the ratio \(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}\), substitute the expressions for \(n_{\text{Si}}\) in terms of \(n_{\text{Fe}}\) and \(n_{\text{Mg}}\):
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,1}} \cdot 1.995}{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / 1.995}.
\]

Using the fact that \(n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}\) and \(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}\), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

Assuming the hydrogen density ratio \((n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}}) = 1\) (a valid assumption if the stars' photospheric conditions are similar), the ratio becomes:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
