Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me read it through and try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, okay, so there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations when observed from Earth, right? And the question is saying that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness changes. So, they're asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same signal in the light curve if there were no spots.

Wait, so the key here is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness when the planet transits the star is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

I remember that the brightness variation due to a planet transit is calculated by the area blocked by the planet over the area of the star. But wait, the spots are a bit different because they're not blocking light; they're just cooler regions. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip as the cooler spots become more visible.

So first, let me think about how the spots affect the brightness. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K. Because the star is rotating, as the spots come into view, the overall brightness changes.

The flux from the star without any spots would be the same as a blackbody at 6000K. But when spots are visible, the total flux is a combination of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

Wait, but the star's total flux is being calculated as the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions. Let me think about the area and the temperature difference.

The effective temperature is the average over the entire surface. So when a spot is present, part of the star's surface emits less flux. So the total flux from the star is (1 - filling factor) * flux from normal areas + filling factor * flux from spots.

But when the star is rotating, we see a varying amount of the spotted hemisphere. So the observed flux will change as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but the question says that the photometric time-series will show periodic variations due to rotation. The problem states that this can resemble an exoplanet. So the idea is that the dip in brightness when the spots are facing us is similar to the dip when a planet transits.

Hmm, but how do we calculate the dip caused by the spots compared to the dip caused by a planet?

Wait, the dip in brightness during a transit is given by the area of the planet relative to the star. So the depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

In the case of the spots, the dip would be based on the area of the spots that are visible as the star rotates. But wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The maximum dip would be when the maximum area of spots is observable. So the question is, what is the equivalent area that the spots would block, leading to a dip as large as that of a planet.

Wait, but the brightness dip due to spots isn't just about area; it's about the difference in flux. Because the spots are cooler, their presence reduces the total flux from the star when they're in view.

So the star's total flux without spots is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot, where f is the filling factor (20% or 0.2) and F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots.

Flux is proportional to T^4, so F0 is proportional to (6000)^4, and F_spot is (5000)^4.

Wait, the flux from the entire star without spots would be F0 = 4πRstar² * σ T_eff^4.

When the spots are present, the flux becomes F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * (F_spot), where F_spot is (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) * F0.

Because F_spot per unit area is (T_spot / T_eff)^4 times the normal flux.

So F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

The relative change in flux when the spots are visible is (F - F0) / F0 = (1 - f) + f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) -1 = -f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

So the dip in flux is f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

Wait, but wait, when the spots are on the side facing us, the flux from those spots is less than the rest of the star. So the net flux is lower, causing the observed brightness to dip.

So the dip in brightness (ΔF) is ΔF = F0 - F = F0 * [1 - ( (1-f) + f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

Which can also be written as ΔF = F0 * [ (f) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

So the fractional change is ΔF / F0 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

But wait, the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area is visible. Since the spots cover one hemisphere, but the star is rotating, so when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the maximum dip occurs.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the total area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π Rstar² / 2) )= 0.2 * π Rstar². So the area of spots is 0.2 * π Rstar².

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, which is the area of spots on the hemisphere. So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the fractional area of spots is 0.2. So the dip in flux would be 0.2 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ), because that's the fractional change.

Wait, but no. Let me think again.

Each spot has a certain area, but when the star rotates, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots that is visible changes. So the maximum dip would be when the maximum area of spots is visible. Since the star is rotating, the spots on one hemisphere become visible as the star turns, and when the other hemisphere comes into view, those spots are not visible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the maximum dip occurs. So the area of spots visible is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 20% of 2π R²/2 = 0.2*(π R²). So the area is 0.2 * π R².

Wait, no. The surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² is visible. So the area blocked is 0.4 π R², but wait, no, that's the area of the spots. But the dip is due to the difference in flux from that area.

So the dip in flux is the difference between the flux without spots and with spots.

Wait, the star without spots emits F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 4π R². When the spots are visible, the flux becomes F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * σ T_spot^4 * (4π R²) ) * (f / (2π R²)) ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me approach it differently.

The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is f=0.2. But since the spots are on only one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire f=0.2 is visible. So the area of spots visible is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4 π R². So the area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R². So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spot area visible is 0.4 π R².

The flux from the star when spots are visible is:

F = [ (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ T_eff^4 ] + [ 0.4 π R² * σ T_spot^4 ]

Which simplifies to:

F = (3.6 π R² σ T_eff^4) + (0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 )

The original flux without spots is F0 = 4 π R² σ T_eff^4.

So the difference F0 - F is:

4 π R² σ T_eff^4 - [3.6 π R² σ T_eff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 ]

= (0.4 π R² σ) [ T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ]

So the dip in flux is 0.4 π R² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The fractional dip is:

ΔF / F0 = [ 0.4 π R² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 π R² σ T_eff^4 ]

Simplify:

= (0.4 /4) * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4

= 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

So the fractional dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Calculating that:

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747

So the fractional dip is approximately 5.177% when the spots are fully visible.

Now, a planet transiting the star would cause a dip equal to (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the flux is proportional to the area blocked.

So we want the dip caused by the planet to be equal to the dip from the spots. So:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517747

Take square root:

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but wait a second. The dip from the spots is 5.177% when the spots are fully visible. So the planet's dip should be equal to that.

Wait, but what's the dip from the planet? It's (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set that equal to 0.0517747.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2276, approximately 0.228.

But looking at the options, the choices are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of these match 0.228. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the area. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when the star's hemisphere is covered with spots, and that hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots visible is (f) * (area of hemisphere). Hemisphere area is 2π R², so area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the area of spots is 0.4 π R².

But the star's total surface area is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface blocked by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, which is 10%. So the dip would be 10% of (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)/T_eff^4.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The dip is the difference in flux due to the spots.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the fractional change in flux. The star's flux when spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )

Ah, perhaps I should think of it that way. So the fractional dip is [1 - ( (1-f) + f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

Which is f * [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

Because 1-f + f*(T_spot^4 / Teff^4) = 1 - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

So the dip is f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Ah, this is a different approach. So with f=0.2, Teff=6000, T_spot=5000.

So:

dip = 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Which is 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.103549, approximately 0.1035 or 10.35%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the dip was 5%, but now it's 10% when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, this contradicts my previous calculation. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Let me clarify. The dip when the spots are fully visible is f*(1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ), which is 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, so 10.355%.

So the dip is about 10.355%.

So for the planet, the dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set that equal to 0.10355.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is about 0.32.

So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the dip was 5%, which gave a radius ratio of ~0.227. But that approach was wrong because I forgot that the f is 0.2, not the area fraction. So in that method, f is the filling factor on the hemisphere, but the actual area is 0.2 * hemisphere area.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the maximum dip as the entire hemisphere is visible. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots is f * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4 π R², so the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted when that hemisphere is facing us is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1 or 10%.

So the dip in flux would be the same as if 10% of the star's surface is at T_spot. So the dip would be 10% * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775 or 5.1775%.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the other approach. Hmm.

I think the confusion is whether the dip is calculated based on the fractional area of spots on the visible hemisphere or the entire star.

Wait, when the star's hemisphere with spots is facing us, the entire area of spots (0.4 π R²) is visible. So the flux dip is the difference between the flux when that area is at Teff and when it's at T_spot.

So the flux without spots would have F0 = 4 π R² * sigma * Teff^4.

With spots, when the hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = [4 π R² - 0.4 π R² ] * sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * sigma T_spot^4.

Which simplifies to F = (3.6 π R² sigma Teff^4) + (0.4 pi R² sigma T_spot^4 )

The dip is F0 - F = (4 pi R² sigma Teff^4) - (3.6 pi R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma T_spot^4 )

= 0.4 pi R² sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The fractional dip is (0.4 pi R² sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R² sigma Teff^4 )

= (0.4 /4) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4

= 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775 or 5.1775%.

So the dip is about 5.18%, which is about 5.18% dip.

Now, for a planet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

Taking square root: Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11? No, that's 0.11. Option D is 0.32, which is about 0.32. Hmm, none of the options match 0.2276.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Because 0.2276 is approximately 0.23, which is close to option A (0.39), B (0.07), C (0.11), D (0.32). No, the options don't have 0.23.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question says: "As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

The maximum dip occurs when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, so the area of spots visible is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

So the dip is 0.4 pi R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

= 0.4/4 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) 

= 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - (5^4)/(6^4) ) = 0.1 * (1 - (625/1296)) = 0.1 * (671/1296 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

So dip is 5.1775%, which is the same as a planet causing a dip of 5.1775% when it transits.

So the planet's radius would be Rpl such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: the flux from the star is modulated because part of the surface is cooler. The maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible. The dip is the difference between the flux without spots and when spots are visible.

So the dip is (F0 - F) / F0 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

Wait, but earlier I calculated f as 0.2. So dip is 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 or 10.355%.

So for a planet, dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which matches option D) ~0.32.

Ah, so which approach is correct? The confusion arises from whether the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere (so 0.2 * 2 pi R²) or 20% of the entire star.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

But when the hemisphere is visible, the area of spots is 0.4 pi R², which is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface area.

So when the spots are fully visible, the flux dip is 10% * [1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ] = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 5.1775%.

Wait, so that can't be right because then the dip is 5.18%, but the other approach gives 10.35% dip.

I think the mistake is that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is fully visible, the spot coverage is 20% of the visible hemisphere, which is 20% of 2 pi R². So the spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the fraction of the star's total area that is covered is (0.4 pi R²)/(4 pi R²) )= 0.1 or 10%.

But the flux dip is (0.1) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ?

Wait, no, because the spots are cooler, the flux from that area is reduced.

Wait, let me model the star as having some fraction of its surface at a lower temperature.

The total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F = (1 - f_hemi) * F0 + f_hemi * F_spot,

where f_hemi is the fraction of the star's surface that is in the visible hemisphere (i.e., 0.5 when the star is viewed face-on), and the spots are f = 0.2 of that hemisphere.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to model the star's surface as having two regions: the spotted hemisphere (which is 50% of the star's surface) and the unspotted hemisphere (50%).

Wait, no. The problem states that only one hemisphere is covered with spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spotted area is 20% of that hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star.

But the unspotted hemisphere is 90% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F = (0.5 * (1 - 0.2) ) * F0 + (0.5 * 1) * F0 + (0.5 * 0.2) * F_spot,

Hmm, no, perhaps a better way is:

The star has two hemispheres. One hemisphere (50% of the star's surface) is covered with spots. The other 50% is unspotted.

But when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 50% of the star is covered with spots (but only 20% of that hemisphere is actually spotted). Wait, no: the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the spotted hemisphere has 20% coverage of spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 0.5 * 4 pi R².

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternative approach: the maximum dip occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible. So the area of spots visible is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The total area of the star is 4 pi R². So the fractional area of spots is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775 or 5.1775%.

So the dip is 5.1775% when the spots are fully visible.

So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775, so Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have 0.2276. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model it as the spot-induced dip being  f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ), where f is the filling factor of the hemisphere (20%).

So dip = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 or 10.355%.

So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355, so Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But why is there a discrepancy between the two approaches?

Ah, perhaps because when the entire hemisphere is visible, the area of spots is 0.2 of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². The total area of the star is 4 pi R². So the fractional area is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1. So the dip should be 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ), which is 5.1775%.

But then the planet would need to block 5.1775% of the flux, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775, Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the dip as f*(1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ), where f is the filling factor (20%).

In that case, dip is 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 or 10.355%.

Which would correspond to Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is option D.

But why would the dip be 10.355% when the spot area is only 10% of the star's surface?

Because the dip is not just the area, but the difference in flux per unit area.

Ah, perhaps because the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ), where f is the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted.

But if the spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the fractional area of spots is f = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) / entire area.

So f = 0.2 * (2 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.1.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 5.1775%.

Thus, the planet would need to block 5.1775% of the flux, which would require a radius ratio of sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation over time as the star rotates, not the maximum dip. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view gradually. The brightness variation would be a function of how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

But the question says that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that caused by a planet.

Wait, perhaps the variation is due to the entire star's brightness being modulated as the spots rotate into and out of view. The variation would depend on the spot distribution and rotation speed.

But the problem says the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet, which would cause a periodic dip as it transits.

But perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the dip from the planet. So the maximum dip in the brightness would be the same as the planet's dip.

So if the dip from the spots is 5.1775%, then the planet's dip is the same, leading to a radius ratio of ~0.2276.

But since the options don't have this, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is whether the spots are on a hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots is visible at any given time. So the brightness variation would have a smoother curve, but the amplitude (maximum dip) would be the same as the dip when the entire hemisphere is visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip caused by the spots is when only a part of the spots is visible, leading to a lower dip than I calculated.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to reason again.

The problem states that the brightness variation due to the spots can resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness change (the depth of the dip) is the same as that caused by a planet.

So the dip from the spots when maximum should equal the dip from the planet.

So the dip from the spots is f_hemi * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ), where f_hemi is the filling factor of the hemisphere (20%).

Because when the hemisphere is fully visible, the spots contribute f_hemi of the star's flux, but at a lower temperature.

So dip = f_hemi (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

= 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 0.2 * (1 - 625/1296 )

= 0.2 * (671/1296 )

= 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 or 10.355%.

So then the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355, leading to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation from Spots**:
   - The maximum brightness dip occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.
   - The flux from the star is reduced due to the cooler spots. The fractional dip in flux is given by:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Calculate \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.482253
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.482253) = 0.2 \cdot 0.517747 \approx 0.10355
     \]
   - The fractional dip in brightness is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

3. **Brightness Variation from a Planet**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \Delta F / F_0
     \]
   - Substituting \( \Delta F / F_0 = 0.10355 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
   - Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated radius ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.3218 \) matches most closely with option **D) ~0.32**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots is approximately **0.32**.
