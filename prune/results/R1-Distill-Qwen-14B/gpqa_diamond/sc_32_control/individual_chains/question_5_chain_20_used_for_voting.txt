Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, right. I remember that an eigenvector is a vector that only changes by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to it. The eigenvalue is that scalar factor.

The problem says the operator is P, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables. So P must be the momentum operator, but maybe it's the Pauli matrices or something else? Oh wait, the components are given as 2x2 matrices, so it's probably spin matrices. Oh, because the eigenvalues of spin are ±ħ/2, right.

Wait, no, the operator here is P, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So perhaps P is the spin operator, like the spin component along some direction. Because in spin-½ systems, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

The problem gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2 each. So,

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each of these is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Right, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, which are these 2x2 matrices.

The operator in question is P, but along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, meaning it's of the form (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Or wait, more accurately, since it's in the x-z plane, any point can be represented with spherical coordinates, but phi would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. So the direction can be parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis. So the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, y-component is zero.

So the operator P along direction n would be the sum of the components in each direction multiplied by the respective unit vectors. So the operator P is actually the vector operator P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat. But since the direction is along n, which is in the x-z plane, the operator along n is P_n = (n · vector P) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, because the direction is n, the operator for spin in that direction is the dot product of the vector operator with n. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because for a unit vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P_n would be sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

So the operator we're interested in is P_n = sinθ (ħ/2 sigma_x) + cosθ (ħ/2 sigma_z). Factoring out ħ/2, that's (ħ/2)( sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ).

We need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

So let's write this as an equation:

(ħ/2)( sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

( sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ) |v> = |v>.

So the equation becomes ( sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ) |v> = 1 |v>.

Wait, but sigma matrices are 2x2, and |v> is a 2-component vector. So we need to find a vector |v> such that when we apply this matrix, it's multiplied by 1.

Wait, but sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So let me write out the matrix:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] 

Which equals:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [ a; b ] = [ a; b ]

Breaking into equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a  --> (cosθ - 1)a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ * a + (-cosθ) b = b --> sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

2) sinθ a + (- (cosθ + 1 )) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps we can solve these.

Let me write equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b

Equation 2:

sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b

So from equation 1: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Wait, but cosθ -1 is in denominator. Let me simplify that.

Note that cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2), using the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2). Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So let's see:

- sinθ / (cosθ -1) = [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]

The negatives cancel, and 2s cancel. So we have [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin²(theta/2) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2).

So equation 1 gives a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Alternatively, from equation 2:

sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b.

Using the same identities, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), and cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So equation 2 becomes: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) a = 2 cos²(theta/2) b.

Divide both sides by 2 cos(theta/2) (assuming cos(theta/2) != 0):

sin(theta/2) a = cos(theta/2) b.

So a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = cot(theta/2) b.

Same as equation 1. So that's consistent. So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2).

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

We can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Alternatively, it's more convenient to write this in terms of sine and cosine. Let me see: cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) , 1 ].

But perhaps we can write it as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by some factor. Wait, let me think. If I factor out 1/sin(theta/2), then the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Because:

[ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ] = (1/sin(theta/2)) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So the vector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. Because if I take [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], then when I apply the matrix, do I get the same vector scaled by 1?

Wait, maybe I should plug in a sample theta to test. Let's say theta is 0. Then the direction is along z. So n is (0,0,1). So the operator Pn is P_z, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the eigenstate [1; 0], because P_z |+z> = (ħ/2)(1) |+z>.

Wait, let me see. If theta is zero, then our expression [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] becomes [ cos(0), sin(0) ] = [1, 0], which is correct. So that's correct for theta=0.

Another test case: theta = pi/2. Then direction is along x. So theta is 90 degrees. Then the eigenvector should be [1;1]/sqrt(2), because P_x has eigenstates [1;1]/sqrt(2) and [1;-1]/sqrt(2) with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

In our expression, theta=pi/2. So theta/2 is pi/4.

cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2. So the vector is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is [1;1]/sqrt(2). Correct. So that works.

Another test: theta = pi. Then direction is along -z. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [0;1], because P_z |0> would be (-ħ/2)|0>, but wait, no. Wait, the operator for P in direction n is along negative z. So the operator would have eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The eigenstate for +ħ/2 would be [0;1], because for direction -z, the up state is |down_z> which is [0;1].

Wait, our formula for theta=pi:

theta/2 is pi/2. So cos(pi/2) is 0, sin(pi/2) is 1. So the vector is [0, 1], which is correct.

So my conclusion is that the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But since eigenvectors are up to a scalar, the actual normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] normalized. Wait, but wait, when theta is 0, [1,0], which is already normalized. Similarly, for theta=pi/2, [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is normalized. So yes, this vector is already a unit vector.

Wait, but wait, let's calculate the norm. |cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 = 1, because cos² + sin² =1. So yes, the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the question says "the normalized eigenvector", so its elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, but let me check the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but why would there be ħ in the eigenvectors? Because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they're vectors in Hilbert space). ħ has units of angular momentum, but the components of the eigenvector should be unitless. So options A and D have ħ in them, which doesn't make sense. So probably the correct answer is C.

Wait, but looking back, the problem statement says the operator's components are given as P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix, etc. So the operator's components are in terms of ħ/2. So when we compute the eigenvectors, they don't have ħ in them because the eigenvectors are just vectors, not operators or observables.

So the eigenvectors' components are unitless; the ħ is part of the operator, not the vector. So options A and D have ħ, which would be incorrect. So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. Specifically:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
\vec{P}_n = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the expressions for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we find:

\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Simplifying, the matrix becomes:

\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

We seek the eigenvector $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P}_n |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

Substituting $\vec{P}_n$ and simplifying, we solve the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
\left( \cos\theta - 1 \right)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \\
\sin\theta a + \left( -\cos\theta - 1 \right)b = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From these equations, we find the ratio $a/b = \cot(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This vector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$ and does not match the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
