Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopy and gas molecules in a vacuum. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because there's less stuff around for electrons to scatter off.

But even after all that pumping, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, considering the compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. Mean free path... I remember that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), but maybe I don't need the exact formula here.

So, the situation is that before the electron beam is on, the mean free path is λ1. But when he turns on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is about what happens to λ2 relative to λ1. The options are about whether it's larger, smaller, same, or within a certain range.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is turned on? Before the beam, the vacuum is at a certain pressure, so the gas molecules are just bouncing around. But when the electron beam is active, the electrons are moving fast. I think the electrons could interact with the gas molecules. Maybe they cause some scattering or ionization.

I remember that in electron microscopy, when you have gas molecules, they can cause electron scattering. But wait, the mean free path in this context is about the gas molecules' movement. Or is it about the electrons' path? Because the question says Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering. So, perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the gas molecules.

Wait, maybe it's more about electron scattering off the gas molecules. If the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving and might collide more with the gas molecules. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Hmm, maybe it's the other way around. The gas molecules are in the vacuum, and when the electron beam is on, the electrons hit the gas molecules, which could cause them to move or change their behavior. But wait, the mean free path λ is for the gas, so if the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, does that change their movement?

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules, which would affect the electron's path. But the question is about the gas's mean free path. Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam leads to more electron-gas molecule interactions, which in turn affects the path of the gas molecules.

Wait, maybe the mean free path λ is for the gas molecules. So, under normal conditions, λ1 is the average distance a gas molecule travels without colliding with others. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the electrons cause the gas molecules to move more, or maybe the electrons induce some electric fields that affect the gas molecules.

Wait another angle: The mean free path in the context of a vacuum system is usually calculated under thermal conditions. But when you have a high-energy electron beam, it might ionize the gas molecules or cause them to be more mobile.

Oh, wait. I think when you have a high-energy electron beam, it can cause gas molecules to become ionized. Ionized gas molecules (ions) have a different mean free path than neutral gas molecules because their behavior changes. Ions can be influenced by electric fields, which in this case, the electron beam itself could create an electric field. So, if the gas molecules are ionized, the mean free path might change.

But wait, the formula for mean free path is based on the assumption of non-ionized (neutral) gas. So, if some of the gas gets ionized, the mean free path could decrease because ions might interact differently, perhaps sticking to the walls or being accelerated by the beam's electric field.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, the mean free path might actually increase because ions might travel further before being stopped or collected by something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's about the electron scattering. If the gas molecules are present, the electrons in the beam would scatter off them. The scattering would create a loss of resolution because the electron beam would spread out. But that's about the electron's mean free path, not the gas's. Hmm, but the question says Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering, which suggests the gas's mean free path is λ2.

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move more, so the mean free path of the gas molecules increases. Or perhaps the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be excited or heated, which changes the temperature. But the question states that the sample compartment temperature remained the same, so temperature isn't a factor here.

Wait, another thought: In a vacuum, the mean free path λ depends on the pressure. Lower pressure means longer mean free path. But Mike's setup is already at ultra-high vacuum. So, when the electron beam is on, does the pressure change? Well, the question says some gas remains, but probably the pressure doesn't change much, as the pumps are already running.

Wait, but wait. When the electron beam is on, could it cause gas molecules to be ionized and then pumped away more efficiently by the vacuum system? Or perhaps the ionized gas is more likely to be drawn into the pumps, thus reducing the effective pressure. That would lower the pressure, which would increase the mean free path λ.

Wait, if the pressure decreases when the beam is on, then the mean free path λ would increase because λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So, λ2 would be larger than λ1. But wait, the question says that the mean free path is no longer equal to λ1, so perhaps λ2 is larger.

Wait, but the options don't all have λ2 > λ1. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.

Option C says λ2 < λ1.

Option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

Wait, so the question is, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Let me think again.

Another possibility: The electron beam can cause gas molecules to be excited or ionized, leading to more frequent collisions with the chamber walls. Wait, if ions are created, they are more likely to be attracted to the walls or the electric fields in the chamber, which could cause them to hit the walls, effectively reducing their mean free path.

Wait, but perhaps the opposite is true. Neutral gas molecules have a certain mean free path, but if they are ionized, they might have a longer mean free path because they are charged and can be influenced by the beam's electric field, moving further before being lost.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause gas molecules to be more likely to be scattered by the beam, thus increasing the effective mean free path because the beam is another source of disturbance. Wait, but that's getting a bit unclear.

Wait, I think I need to think about the physics here. The mean free path of gas molecules in a vacuum depends on the pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. The formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules, P is pressure. So, if pressure is lower, λ is higher.

But in Mike's case, the pressure is already ultra-low. So, the mean free path λ1 is calculated based on that. But when he turns on the electron beam, what happens to the pressure?

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes some gas molecules to be knocked out of the chamber. For example, when an electron hits a gas molecule, it might ionize it, and the ion could be repelled by the electric fields, moving towards the walls or pumps, effectively removing it from the system. So, the number of gas molecules in the compartment decreases when the beam is on. If the number of gas molecules decreases, the pressure decreases, so the mean free path λ would increase. Therefore, λ2 would be greater than λ1. So, λ2 > λ1.

But wait, if the pressure decreases, then λ increases. So, in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1. Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. So that might be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question states that the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So, temperature isn't a factor here.

Another thought: The presence of the electron beam may cause gas molecules to be more mobile. For example, the beam may impart energy to the gas molecules, causing them to move faster. Faster-moving molecules would have a higher mean free path because they cover more distance between collisions. So, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but the formula for mean free path λ is directly proportional to temperature. So, if the temperature increases (but the question says it's the same), so that's not a factor here.

So, if the electron beam is causing some gas molecules to leave the compartment (because they're ionized and pumped away), the effective pressure in the compartment would decrease. Lower pressure leads to higher mean free path, so λ2 would be larger than λ1.

That would suggest that λ2 is greater than λ1. So, looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*lambda1, which is possible if the pressure drops enough. Option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1. But if the pressure drops a lot, λ2 could be much larger than λ1, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but the mean free path before was calculated under the assumption that the gas is at the given pressure. When the beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure is lower because some molecules are being removed, leading to a higher λ2.

But the question doesn't say that the pressure changed. It just says he detected some gas particles, but maybe the electron beam's presence doesn't change the pressure (since the pumps are already running). Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait another angle: The mean free path λ depends on the gas's behavior. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is ionized, which changes the effective cross-section for collisions. Because ions have different properties than neutral molecules.

Wait, but ions would have a different mean free path because they interact differently. The formula for λ assumes neutral molecules. If the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path calculation might change. For ions, the mean free path could be longer because they're charged and might interact more with the chamber walls or other ions.

Alternatively, the presence of a charged particle (electron beam) would cause ions to experience electric forces, which could influence their movement. If the ions are being accelerated, their mean free path might increase.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, perhaps the mean free path decreases because the ions stick to the walls more, or because they're more likely to be captured by the pumps. So, maybe the mean free path would decrease.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about what causes the mean free path to change. Since Mike's observation is that the mean free path is no longer λ1, and the temperature is same, the only variable is the pressure or the nature of the gas.

But the pressure doesn't change because the pumps are already creating the ultra-high vacuum. So, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it somehow causes the gas molecules to behave differently. Maybe the gas molecules are being excited or ionized, which affects their collision properties.

Wait, another thought: The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the gas is ionized, perhaps the ions have a longer mean free path because they experience less frequent collisions. Alternatively, they might collide more frequently with the chamber walls due to their charge, leading to a shorter mean free path.

But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to become more mobile, leading to higher speeds, which would lead to a longer mean free path.

If λ2 is larger than λ1, then option A or D. But if it's smaller, then option C.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules are removed from the system. So, effectively, fewer gas molecules are in the compartment when the beam is on, leading to a lower pressure and thus a higher mean free path. So, λ2 is larger than λ1.

So the answer would be either A or D. But the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1, but it's now λ2. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2?

Wait, but the mean free path is calculated based on the number density of the gas. If the number of gas molecules decreases due to ionization and pumping, the number density n decreases. Since λ is inversely proportional to n (because λ ~ 1/n), then if n decreases, λ increases.

So, λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1. Now, looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1. But why 1.22?

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the effective pressure is lower because the beam helps in removing the gas. But if the pressure is lower, the mean free path increases. So, how much does it increase? Well, it depends on how much the pressure has decreased.

Wait, but Mike calculated λ1 based on the factors including pressure. When the beam is on, the pressure might have dropped, but perhaps not enough to make λ2 more than 1.22 times λ1. So why 1.22?

Wait, perhaps the 1.22 is a factor related to the effect of the electron beam. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path in the presence of the electron beam is calculated with a different formula. Maybe the effective cross-section changes because the gas is ionized.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the electron's mean free path, not the gas's. Oh wait, the question says Mike observed the mean free path based on electron scattering. So, perhaps the question is about the electron's mean free path.

Wait, that's a different perspective. So, when Mike is using the electron beam, he's looking at how far the electrons travel before scattering. The mean free path for electrons would be the average distance they travel between scattering events.

In that case, the presence of gas molecules would reduce the mean free path of the electrons. So, λ1 is the mean free path of the electrons in the vacuum before the beam is on. But when the beam is on, perhaps the gas is ionized, leading to more scattering centers. Or maybe the ions have different scattering properties.

Wait, but the mean free path in electron microscopy is a critical factor for resolution. A longer mean free path (electrons traveling further without scattering) leads to better resolution. So, if the mean free path of the electrons is shorter (because more scattering), the resolution is worse.

But in this scenario, Mike's observation is about the mean free path changing. If the electron's mean free path is λ1 before the beam is on, and λ2 when it's on, and λ2 is shorter, then the answer would be C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but wait. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are present and cause electron scattering. So, the electron's mean free path would be shorter than λ1, because now there are gas molecules in the way. So λ2 < λ1.

But wait, the setup says that the mean free path of the gas is λ1. So, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says: Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules to be λ1. Then, upon initiating the electron beam, he found that the mean free path was no longer λ1; it was λ2.

Wait, so the mean free path of the gas molecules is now λ2. So, in the initial state (no beam), the gas has mean free path λ1. With the beam, it's λ2.

So, the question is, why would the gas's mean free path change?

If the presence of the electron beam somehow affects the gas molecules' movement. Maybe the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, leading to charged particles. Charged particles (ions) have different behavior. For example, they could be more likely to stick to the walls or be pumped away more effectively.

If the ions are being removed from the compartment, the number density of the gas decreases, so the mean free path λ increases. So, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So, λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

But why would it be exactly 1.22? I'm not sure. Maybe that number comes from some standard factor, like the effect of ionization on mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to ionize, and the ions have a longer mean free path because they're more mobile. Or perhaps because the ions are being accelerated towards the walls, their mean free path is shorter.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me think about the primary effect. The presence of the electron beam can cause gas ionization. The ionized gas would have a different mean free path than the neutral gas. The mean free path for ions could be longer because they're influenced by electric fields, but that depends on the setup.

Alternatively, if the ionized gas is more easily pumped away, the effective pressure would drop, leading to a longer mean free path. So, λ2 would be longer than λ1.

So, the answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. So, the options that have λ2 > λ1 are A, D.

But the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So, if λ2 is greater, then either A or D.

But how much greater? The question doesn't give data on how much λ2 increased. However, the options suggest that 1.22 is a significant factor. Perhaps in the presence of an electron beam, the mean free path of the gas doubles or increases by a certain factor.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path for electrons in the beam is a different consideration than the mean free path of the gas molecules. But the question is about the gas's mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question states that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, so that's not a factor.

Then, the only change is that the gas is ionized, leading to a different mean free path. Let's think about the cross-section for collisions.

In neutral gas, the collision cross-section depends on the molecular diameter. For ions, the cross-section might be different because they have an electric charge. For example, ions could experience Coulomb forces, which might increase or decrease the collision cross-section. If the cross-section increases, the mean free path decreases because molecules collide more often. If it decreases, the mean free path increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are more likely to collide with the chamber walls, which would effectively reduce their mean free path because they're hitting the walls more often than other gas molecules.

Wait, if the ions are being attracted to the walls (due to the electric field from the electron beam), their mean free path would decrease because they would hit the walls more often. So, the mean free path of the gas (ions) would be less than that of neutral gas. Thus, λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, that would make λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Let me try to summarize:

- If the electron beam causes the gas to be pumped away more efficiently (ionized gas is removed), then the pressure decreases, so λ2 > λ1.

- If the gas becomes ionized and the ions have a shorter mean free path (due to more collisions with walls), then λ2 < λ1.

Which effect dominates?

I think the key here is that when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas is ionized, and the ions are more mobile and perhaps are removed from the system (e.g., pumped away by the vacuum system). If this happens, the effective number of gas molecules in the compartment decreases, leading to a lower pressure, and thus a longer mean free path for the remaining gas.

Wait, but if the ions are being removed, the number of gas particles in the compartment goes down, so the pressure decreases.

So, with lower pressure, the mean free path λ increases. So, λ2 is larger than λ1.

Thus, the correct option would be either A or D.

But why the factor of 1.22? Maybe that's a standard factor when considering ionization effects. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the ions is longer because they're moving faster or have different collision dynamics.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ionized gas's mean free path is longer because the ions are more likely to travel further without colliding. So, the mean free path λ2 is greater than λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

But the options don't specify whether it's more than 1.22 times or just greater. Without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the answer is A, assuming that the effect is significant.

But wait, the question says Mike accurately determined λ1, but upon initiating the beam, λ2 is different. The only way to know for sure is to consider the physics that the mean free path increases when the pressure decreases, which occurs when the gas is ionized and pumped away more efficiently.

So, the mean free path λ2 is greater than λ1. So, the answer must be either A or D.

Wait, the options don't say anything about λ2 being exactly 1.22 times. They just compare relative sizes.

But the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1

So, if the presence of the beam causes the mean free path to increase, but not by a huge amount, perhaps the factor is between 1 and 1.22. But if the beam causes a significant change, perhaps it's more than 1.22.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe 1.22 is a red herring, and the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so any option that says λ2 > λ1 is correct.

Wait, looking again at the options, option A says λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 λ1, and option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

So, the question is, does the mean free path increase by more than 22% or less?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces more scattering events for the gas molecules, reducing their mean free path. Wait, that would mean λ2 < λ1, but that contradicts earlier reasoning.

Wait, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path could decrease if the ions have a higher cross-section for collisions. Alternatively, if the ions are more mobile, their mean free path could be longer.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me think about the possible factors again.

The mean free path of a gas is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P).

If the pressure P decreases, λ increases. So, if the presence of the electron beam reduces the pressure, λ increases.

So, when the beam is on, the pressure is lower, so λ2 > λ1.

Thus, the answer would either be A or D.

But the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; it was λ2.

Now, the factor of 1.22. I'm not sure where that comes from. Maybe it's a standard factor related to the effect of the electron beam.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the effective diameter increases, which would decrease the mean free path. But that would make λ2 smaller, which would align with option C.

Wait, but if the gas becomes ionized, perhaps the cross-section for collisions increases because ions have larger effective sizes. So, the mean free path λ would decrease.

So, if d increases, λ decreases.

So, in that case, λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But wait, would the ion's diameter be larger? Maybe, because the ion has an electron cloud, making it effectively larger.

Thus, the collision cross-section increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So, the conclusion would be that λ2 is less than λ1, making option C correct.

But earlier reasoning suggested that the pressure decreases, leading to a longer mean free path. So, which effect is stronger?

Hmm, perhaps both factors are in play. The pressure might decrease (reducing n, so increasing λ), but the effective diameter d increases (reducing λ). So, the combined effect depends on which effect is more dominant.

Wait, the mean free path is inversely proportional to P and proportional to 1/d². So, if pressure decreases by a factor X, and d increases by a factor Y, then λ scales as (X) / (Y²). 

But without knowing the exact factors of X and Y, it's hard to say. But given that the pressure is already ultra-low, maybe the change in d is more significant.

Wait, but in the ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is already so low that the mean free path is very long. So, perhaps the effect of the electron beam (ionization leading to increased collision cross-section) is more significant.

In that case, the mean free path would decrease, making λ2 < λ1.

So, the answer would be option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the mean free path of the gas in the system is calculated under thermal conditions. When the electron beam is applied, the gas is ionized, which changes the dynamics. In ionized gas (plasma), the mean free path can be longer because the ions are more mobile and may not collide as frequently as neutral molecules. Wait, but that depends on the plasma's properties.

Alternatively, in a plasma, the mean free path can be shorter due to increased collision rates between ions and electrons.

Wait, perhaps in the presence of the electron beam, the gas becomes a plasma, leading to more frequent collisions and thus a shorter mean free path.

So, that would make λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the likely factors.

Considering that the presence of the electron beam likely ionizes the gas, and ionized gas has a higher collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path. So, λ2 < λ1. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question revolves around the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum chamber when an electron beam is applied. Initially, the mean free path is determined to be λ1 under the given vacuum conditions. Upon applying the electron beam, Mike observes that the mean free path changes to λ2. The task is to determine how λ2 compares to λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Basics**:  
   The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules is influenced by pressure (P), temperature (T), and the effective diameter of the molecules (d). The formula is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
   \]  
   where \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant. Lower pressure (P) or smaller effective diameter (d) increases λ, while higher pressure or larger effective diameter decreases λ.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   - When the electron beam is applied, it can ionize the gas molecules, converting them into charged particles (ions).  
   - Ionized gas behaves differently from neutral gas. For example, ions may interact with the chamber walls or the electron beam's electric field, altering their behavior.  
   - Additionally, ionized gas may be more efficiently pumped away by the vacuum system, potentially reducing the effective pressure in the chamber.

3. **Pressure and Mean Free Path**:  
   If the electron beam reduces the effective pressure in the chamber (e.g., by removing ionized gas), the mean free path λ would increase. However, the question specifies that the sample compartment temperature remains constant, and there is no explicit indication that the pressure changes significantly.

4. **Collision Cross-Section and Ionization**:  
   - Ionization can increase the effective collision cross-section of gas molecules, as ions may have larger effective sizes or interact more frequently due to Coulomb forces.  
   - A larger collision cross-section reduces the mean free path (λ), as gas molecules collide more frequently.

5. **Combined Effects**:  
   - The pressure may decrease slightly due to ionized gas being pumped away, which would increase λ.  
   - However, the ionization likely increases the effective collision cross-section, which decreases λ.  
   - Given the ultra-high vacuum conditions, the pressure effect is already minimal, and the dominant factor is likely the increased collision cross-section due to ionization.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the electron beam ionizes the gas, leading to a shorter mean free path (λ2 < λ1). This aligns with the reasoning that ionization increases the effective collision cross-section, reducing the mean free path. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
