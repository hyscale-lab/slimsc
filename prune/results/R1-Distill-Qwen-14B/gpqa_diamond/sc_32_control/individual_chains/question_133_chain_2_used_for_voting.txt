Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions have always been a bit tricky for me. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the problem says that there's a solution with 200 cm³ volume, containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. And we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it goes through different stages. The phosphate ions in solution depend on the pH, right? And since we're dealing with a buffer solution, I think we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, wait. Let me get the substances right. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K H2PO4, so it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium dihydrogen phosphate with two waters of crystallization. So when it dissolves, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the relevant Ka here is Ka2 of H3PO4, because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

The Ka values given are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. So for the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- system, the Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Right, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

But wait, we don't know the pH yet. Oh wait, but since the solution is made from these two salts, we don't need to calculate pH separately. Because the buffer equation will take care of it, and if the concentrations are in a certain ratio, the pH will adjust accordingly.

So first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

But wait, the problem gives the masses of the salts. So I should calculate the moles of each.

Molar masses:
KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let's compute that.

1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol. So about 0.007335 moles of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005615 mol. So about 0.005615 moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So concentrations are moles divided by volume.

So concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M. And HPO4^2- is 0.005615 / 0.2 = 0.028075 M.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the moles.

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol. Yes.

And 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005615 mol. Correct.

So in 0.2 L, H2PO4^- is 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M, and HPO4^2- is 0.005615 / 0.2 = 0.028075 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ let's compute that.

6.2e-8 = 6.2 x 10^-8. So log is log(6.2) + (-8) log(10). log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so pKa2 is 7.2076 (since 6.2e-8 is 10^-7.2076).

Wait, wait no. Wait, pKa is -log10(Ka). So Ka is 6.2e-8, so pKa = -log(6.2e-8).

Let me compute that. log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so 6.2e-8 is 10^-7.2076, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028075 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036675 M.

So the ratio is 0.028075 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.766.

log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.114 = 7.0936.

Wait, but we need the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

Hmm, wait. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is it PO4^3-? Wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 is the fully protonated form. When it loses one H+, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), then PO4^3- (orthophosphate).

Wait, but in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The PO4^3- concentration would be minimal because the third dissociation constant (Ka3) is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller. So in this buffer, PO4^3- is negligible compared to the other species.

But wait, why is the question asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions? Because in our solution, the two species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

So the PO4^3- concentration would come from the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

So we can calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 value.

But wait, since the solution is buffered at a certain pH, which we calculated as around 7.09, we can use the pH and pKa3 to find the concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is equal to [HPO4^2-] multiplied by (Ka3 / [H+]).

Wait, let's think. The equilibrium is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

So the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.028075 M. [H+] can be found from the pH we calculated.

pH is about 7.09, so [H+] is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So plug in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / 8.21e-8

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028075 ≈ 5.0535e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.0535e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.156e-7 M.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028075 = 1.8 * 0.028075 = 0.050535, so 0.050535e-12 = 5.0535e-14.

Denominator: 8.21e-8.

So 5.0535e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0535 / 8.21) * 1e-6.

5.0535 / 8.21 ≈ 0.6156.

So 0.6156e-6 = 6.156e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But perhaps I made some approximations.

Wait, let me check all calculations again.

First, the moles:

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007335 mol.

Na2HPO4*2H2O: 1g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005615 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 / 0.2 = 0.028075 M.

Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.2076.

Ratio: 0.028075 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.766.

log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.114 ≈ 7.0936.

[H+] = 10^-7.0936 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.21e-8) = ?

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028075 = 5.0535e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.0535e-14 /8.21e-8 = 5.0535/(8.21e8) * 1e-6.

Wait, 5.0535e-14 /8.21e-8 = (5.0535/8.21) * 1e-6.

Compute 5.0535 /8.21. Let's compute that precisely.

8.21 × 0.615 = 5.05 (approx). So 5.0535 / 8.21 ≈ 0.6156.

So 0.6156e-6 = 6.156e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B) 5.48e-7 

C) 2.81e-7 

D) 3.97e-7 

Hmm, 6.156e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7). But maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of [H+] is better computed. Let me calculate 10^-7.0936 more precisely.

pH is 7.0936. So [H+] = 10^(-7.0936) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0936) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.820.

Because 10^(-0.0936) is approximately 0.820. So [H+] is 8.20e-8 M, which is what I used.

Wait, but let me compute 10^-0.0936.

0.0936 is approximately 0.094. Let's compute log(0.82) is about -0.087. Hmm, but wait, 10^(-0.0936) is e^(-0.0936 * ln10) ≈ e^(-0.0936 * 2.3026) ≈ e^(-0.2154) ≈ 0.806. So [H+] is 8.06e-8 M.

Wait, that's a slight change. Let me recalculate [PO4^3-].

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.06e-8)

Compute numerator as 5.0535e-14.

Denominator 8.06e-8.

5.0535e-14 /8.06e-8 = (5.0535/8.06 )e-6 = 0.627e-6 → 6.27e-7 M.

That's about 6.27e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, in the Henderson-Hasselbalch, the ratio should be [base]/[acid], which is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]. Did I get that right?

Yes, because in the H-H equation, base is HPO4^2- (conjugate base of H2PO4^- ), so yes.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate more precisely the pH.

Let me re-calculate the pH with more exact numbers.

Compute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028075 / 0.036675 = let's compute exactly.

0.028075 ÷ 0.036675 = ?

Dividing 28075 by 36675. Let me compute 28075 ÷ 36675.

36675 * 0.766 = 36675 * 0.7 = 25672.5, 36675 * 0.06 = 2200.5, 36675 * 0.006=220.05. So 25672.5 + 2200.5=27873, +220.05=28093.05. Which is close to 28075. So 0.766 gives 28093, so the real ratio is 28075/36675 ≈ 0.766, but a tiny bit less. So perhaps log(0.766) is more accurately around -0.114, as before.

So pH remains about 7.0936.

Wait, but maybe the exact value would be better with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the exact [PO4^3-] using the exact Ka3 and [HPO4^2-].

Wait, another approach: The concentration of PO4^3- can also be found using the third dissociation step.

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

So the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Which is what I did earlier.

So plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028075 M.

[H+] is 10^-7.0936 ≈ 8.06e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / 8.06e-8

= (5.0535e-14) / 8.06e-8 = 6.27e-7 M.

But option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, another approach: maybe the initial assumption is that the majority of phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- is negligible. But the question is asking for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-, so I have to calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the [H+] calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, pH = 7.0936 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0936) = 10^(-7 -0.0936) ) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.0936.

What's 10^-0.0936?

Using a calculator, 10^0.0936 = approximately 1.246 → since log(1.246)=0.094. So 10^-0.0936 is 1/1.246 = 0.802.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.802 = 8.02e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) /8.02e-8 → let's compute.

1.8e-12 * 0.028075 = 5.0535e-14.

5.0535e-14 /8.02e-8 → 5.0535 /8.02 = approx 0.630.

0.630e-6 → 6.30e-7.

That's 6.30e-7, which is about 6.3e-7. But the option A is 6.24e-7.

Hmm, maybe I should carry more decimal places in the calculations to be precise.

Let me compute 1.00 / 136.09 more accurately.

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007335 mol.

Same with 1.00 /177.99 → 0.005615 mol.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation of the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 / 0.2 = 0.028075 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

Ratio = 0.028075 / 0.036675 = let's compute it exactly.

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.000025: numerator becomes 1123, denominator 1467.

1123 / 1467 → approximately 0.766.

But let me compute it with more precision.

Compute 0.028075 / 0.036675:

Let me compute 28075 / 36675.

Let me compute 36675 × 0.766 = 36675 * 0.7 = 25672.5, 36675 * 0.06 = 2200.5, 36675 * 0.006=220.05 → sum 25672.5 +2200.5=27873, +220.05=28093.05.

But our numerator is 28075, which is 28093.05 - 18.05. So 28075 = 36675 * 0.766 - 18.05.

So the ratio is 0.766 - (18.05/36675) → 18.05/36675 ≈ 0.0004923.

So ratio ≈ 0.766 - 0.0004923 ≈ 0.7655.

So log(0.7655) = ?

Log(0.7655) → since 10^-0.114 is about 0.77, but more accurately, let me compute.

We can use the formula ln(x) ≈ (x-1) for small x, but perhaps better to compute log(0.7655).

Alternatively, using logarithm tables or approximations.

We know that log(0.76) is about -0.117.

Wait, another approach: 10^(-0.114) = 0.765, so that matches.

So log(0.7655) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ pKa2 + (-0.114) → 7.2076 - 0.114 = 7.0936.

So [H+] is 10^-7.0936 ≈ 8.06e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] is (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.06e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028075 = 5.0535e-14.

Denominator:8.06e-8 → 8.06e-8 = 8.06 × 1e-8.

So 5.0535e-14 /8.06e-8 = (5.0535 /8.06) × 1e-6.

5.0535 ÷ 8.06 ≈ 0.627.

Wait, 8.06 × 0.627 = 5.057.

So 5.0535 /8.06 ≈ 0.627 → 0.627e-6 → 6.27e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.27e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.24e-7.

But perhaps I should carry more precise decimal points in calculations.

Wait, perhaps using exact pH calculation.

Wait, another thought: Is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation accurate here? Well, given that the concentrations are in a 0.766 ratio, and the pKa is 7.2076, so the pH is around 7.09, which is correct.

Another possibility: Maybe the solution considers that PO4^3- comes from both the HPO4^2- and the H2PO4^- via multiple dissociations. But no, because the H2PO4^- would go to HPO4^2- via Ka1, but we've already considered that in the buffer. The PO4^3- comes only from the HPO4^2- dissociation, which is governed by Ka3.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact [H+] using the exact H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations.

But no, I think the approach is correct. So the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.27e-7 M, which rounds to 6.27e-7. The options have 6.24e-7 as option A.

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would get a little closer. Let me compute 5.0535e-14 /8.06e-8 → 5.0535 /8.06 = ?

Let me compute 5.0535 ÷8.06.

Let me do it step by step.

8.06 × 0.627 = 5.057 (as before).

So 5.0535 is 5.0535, which is 5.0535 -5.057 = -0.0035 less than 5.057.

So 0.627 - (0.0035/8.06) → 0.0035/8.06 ≈ 0.000434.

So 0.627 - 0.000434 = 0.626566.

So 0.626566e-6 = 6.26566e-7 → approximately 6.266e-7 M.

Which is about 6.27e-7, which is 6.27 × 10^-7.

So the option A is 6.24e-7, which is close but not exact. But perhaps the correct answer is option D, 3.97e-7?

Wait, no, wait—no, option D is 3.97e-7, which is lower than the calculated 6.2e-7.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, another approach: Could the orthophosphate come from two sources? Like HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

No, because HPO4^2- is the one that can dissociate further. H2PO4^- would first dissociate to HPO4^2- via Ka2. But in that case, the PO4^3- comes only from HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution accounts for the total phosphate, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate (PO4^3-), so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact moles considering the accurate volume.

Wait, 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters exactly.

Wait, what if the solution is using exact numbers for pH?

Let me compute the pH more accurately.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = 7.2076.

log(ratio) = log(0.028075 / 0.036675) = log(0.7655).

Let me compute log(0.7655) using a calculator-like approach.

We know that log(0.7655) = log(7.655e-1) = log(7.655) -1.

log(7.655) is about 0.8846 (since 10^0.8846≈7.65).

So log(0.7655) = 0.8846 -1 = -0.1154.

So pH = 7.2076 -0.1154 = 7.0922.

So [H+] = 10^-7.0922 → let's compute it more accurately.

7.0922 → 7 + 0.0922.

10^0.0922 = 1.238 (since 10^0.09 is about 1.23, and 0.0922 is a bit more, say 1.238).

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 1.238 → 1.238e-7 M? Wait no, wait. Wait, 10^-7.0922 is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0922) = 1e-7 * (1/10^0.0922) → 10^0.0922 is approx 1.238 → so 1e-7 /1.238 → 8.07e-8.

Wait, no. Wait, 10^-7.0922 is 10^( -7 -0.0922 ) = (10^-7) * (10^-0.0922) → 1e-7 * (1/10^0.0922) → 1e-7 * (1/1.238) → 8.07e-8 M.

So [H+] is 8.07e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.07e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028075 = 5.0535e-14.

Denominator:8.07e-8 → 8.07e-8 = 8.07 × 1e-8.

So 5.0535e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.0535 /8.07) ×1e-6.

5.0535 ÷8.07 → let's compute.

8.07 × 0.626 = 5.05 (approx).

8.07 × 0.626 = 8 ×0.626=5.008, 0.07×0.626≈0.0438 → sum 5.0518.

So 5.0535 ÷8.07 ≈ 0.626.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.626e-6=6.26e-7 M.

Which is 6.26e-7 → approximately 6.26e-7, which is 6.26 ×10^-7.

The options are:

A)6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7.

So the closest option is A) 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, perhaps I should check if I made an error in the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] concentrations.

Wait, the molar masses:

KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.

Molar mass of K is 39.10, H2PO4 is 90.9. Wait, adding up: K (39.1) + H2 (2*1.008)=2.016 + P (30.97) + O4 (4*16=64) → 39.1 +2.016=41.116 +30.97=72.086 +64=136.086 → yes, 136.09 is correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Molar mass is Na (22.99 each) × 2 =45.98, HPO4 is 95.99 (H:1, P:30.97, O4:64 → total 1+30.97 +64=95.97), plus 2 H2O (each 18.015 → 36.03). So 45.98 +95.97=141.95 +36.03=177.98 → which rounds to 177.99, correct.

So moles are correctly calculated.

Thus, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is closest to option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, but perhaps the exact [H+] is a bit different. Let me compute 10^(-7.0922) precisely.

Another approach: Using a calculator, 7.0922 → [H+] = 10^-7.0922 → let me compute log(8.07e-8) to see.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximations.

Wait, the exact calculation:

[H+] = 10^(-7.0922) ≈ 8.06 × 10^-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.06e-8) → 5.0535e-14 /8.06e-8 = 6.27e-7 M.

But option A is 6.24e-7, which is just a bit lower. So perhaps a more precise calculation would get 6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps using the exact pH value in the [H+] calculation.

Wait, 7.0922 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0922) = 8.06e-8.

So, computing 5.0535e-14 /8.06e-8 → 5.0535 /8.06 = 0.627.

0.627e-6 → 6.27e-7.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact ratio.

Wait, considering that 0.028075 /0.036675 is exactly 28075/36675.

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 25: 1123 /1467.

1123 ÷1467 → let me compute this as a decimal.

1467 ×0.765= 1123. 1467 ×0.765 = 1467*(0.7+0.06+0.005) = 1026.9 +88.02 +7.335= 1026.9+88.02=1114.92+7.335=1122.255.

Wait, 1467 ×0.765 = 1122.255, which is less than 1123 by 0.745.

So 0.765 + 0.745/1467 ≈ 0.765 + 0.000508 → 0.765508.

So ratio is ≈0.765508.

log(0.765508) → let me compute using a calculator.

Log(0.7655) is approximately -0.114.

So pH is 7.2076 -0.114 =7.0936.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too nitpicky. I think the answer intended is option D or A, but I'm seeing that my calculation leads to 6.27e-7, which is close to option A.

But wait, looking back at the problem, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is actually calculated via another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming [H+] is 8e-8.

Wait, another approach: Using the exact [H+] from pH.

[H+] = 10^-pH =10^(-7.0922)=8.06e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075)/(8.06e-8)=6.27e-7.

Which is 6.27e-7. So the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

Therefore, the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The relevant dissociation step for PO₄³⁻ is the third dissociation of H₃PO₄:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻** (from KH₂PO₄):  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007335 \, \text{mol}
  \]

- **Moles of HPO₄²⁻** (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005615 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.  
- **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻**:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007335 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036675 \, \text{M}
  \]

- **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻**:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005615 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028075 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
\]

- \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076 \)
- Ratio of base to acid:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028075}{0.036675} \approx 0.7655
  \]
- \( \log(0.7655) \approx -0.114 \)

Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 - 0.114 \approx 7.0936
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using \( \text{Ka}_3 \)
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

- \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \)
- \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0936} \approx 8.06 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028075)}{8.06 \times 10^{-8}} \)

Calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028075) \approx 5.0535 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Divide by \( [\text{H⁺}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0535 \times 10^{-14}}{8.06 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.27 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.27 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}**.
