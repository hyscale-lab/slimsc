Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness variation due to the spots moving in and out of view will look like a periodic change in brightness—similar to an exoplanet transiting the star.

The question is asking: If we didn't have these spots, what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So, we're comparing the signal caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

Hmm. I think the key here is to calculate the change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) caused by the spots and then find out what planet size would cause the same change.

Let me recall what I know about light curves. When a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So, the amplitude (delta flux) is proportional to this squared term.

But wait, the problem isn't about a planet causing a dip; it's about the star's spots causing a variation. So I need to compute the variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the variation caused by the planet.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Oh wait, no, the filling factor is 20%—so that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, maybe I should think about the total area covered by spots.

Let me think. The star is a sphere. When only one hemisphere is spotted, the total area covered by spots is the filling factor multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. Wait, or is the filling factor the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots? The question says that the hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, so the spots occupy 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area with spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

The area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface. If the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%", that could mean that in that hemisphere, 20% is spots. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR²), since a hemisphere is 2πR².

But let me be precise. The total surface area of a sphere is 4πR². The area of one hemisphere is 2πR². So if a hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, that's 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² of spots on the star.

But the star is rotating so only one hemisphere is spotted, but when it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum effect would be when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when it's opposite.

Wait, actually, the variation in brightness comes from the spots being present in the observed hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots that are on the side facing us will cause a dip in brightness because they are darker. Wait, but in the problem, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is periodic because as it rotates, the spotted area moves into and out of view.

But how does the temperature affect the brightness? The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But the spots are cooler. So the spots have a temperature of Teff - 1000 K, which is 5000 K.

Wait, so the star's total brightness when spots are present would be less than when they're not. So when the spotted area is facing us, the observed flux is lower than when it's not.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the variation in brightness is similar. So if you have a planet transiting, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. For the spots, the dip is the area of spots times the difference in brightness per unit area.

Hmm. So the change in brightness when the spots are visible would be the sum of the spots' contribution. So each spot is darker, so when a spot is in view, it reduces the total brightness.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: The star's brightness without any spots is L. When a spot is present on the surface, the area of the spot emits less flux.

So the flux from the spot is sigma * T_spot^4, whereas the surrounding area is sigma * T_star^4. So the difference per unit area is (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * sigma.

Thus, the total change in flux when the spot is visible is the area of the spot multiplied by (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * sigma.

But wait, the star's total flux is 4πR² σ Teff^4. So when a spot of area A is present, the flux from the spot is A * σ T_spot^4.

The difference in flux is (A σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)).

Wait no, because the star's normal flux in that area is σ Teff^4 per unit area. So the spot is emitting less. So the difference is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * A * sigma.

Wait, but when the spot is in view, the total flux is less than the star's full flux. So the change in flux is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * A * sigma.

Wait, but the star's total flux without spots is 4πR² σ Teff^4. When a spot of area A is present, the flux is (4πR² σ Teff^4) - (A σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)).

So the relative change in flux is [ (A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) ] / [4πR² Teff^4 ].

Wait, but this is the change in flux. The amplitude of the light curve (the dip) would be this value.

But in the problem, the spots are on a hemisphere, and as the star rotates, the spotted area comes into view. So when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the maximum dip in flux occurs.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So A = 0.4 π R².

So the change in flux is A * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * sigma.

Wait, but the star's total flux is 4π R² sigma Teff^4.

So the relative change in flux (delta F / F) is [A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [4π R² Teff^4 ].

But let's compute that.

A is 0.4 π R².

So delta F / F = [0.4 π R² ( (6000^4) - (5000^4) ) ] / [4 π R² (6000^4) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The R² and pi terms cancel out.

So:

0.4 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4) / (4 *6e3^4 )

Compute 6e3^4 = (6*1e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5e3^4 = (5*1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

Now, delta F / F = 0.4 * 6.71e14 / (4 * 1.296e15 )

Compute denominator: 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So numerator: 0.4 * 6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

So delta F / F = 2.684e14 / 5.184e15.

Let me compute that: 2.684 / 51.84 = approx 0.0517, or 5.17%.

Wait, 2.684e14 is 2.684 x10^14, denominator is 5.184e15 = 5.184 x10^15.

So 2.684 / 51.84 = 0.0517 or ~5.17%.

So the relative change in flux is about 5.17%. 

Wait, but I thought the light curve dip from the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the dip amplitude from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we need to set this equal to the dip from the spots, which is 5.17%.

Wait, but wait. No, the dip from the planet is when the planet blocks the star's light. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. The dip from the spots is when the spots are in view, making the star appear dimmer by that same relative amount.

So to find Rp such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 5.17% or 0.0517.

Wait, but let me make sure. The planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. The spot-induced dip is approx 5.17%. So to get the same amplitude, the planet must cause a 5.17% dip. Thus, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, but that's about 0.227, which is roughly 0.23. But the options don't have that. Hmm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of delta F/F.

Let me re-calculate the delta F/F.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4):

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = 5^4 *1e12=625e12.

Difference: 1296e12 -625e12=671e12.

So delta F/F = [0.4 π R² * 671e12 ] / [4 pi R² * 1296e12 ]

Wait, 671e12 is 6.71e14.

Wait, the denominator is 4 *1296e12=5184e12=5.184e15.

So delta_F is 0.4 * 671e12 * pi R² * sigma.

Wait, perhaps I should factor in the sigma, but in the ratio, the sigma cancels out.

Wait, let me compute the expression again:

delta F / F = (A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ) / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

A is 0.4 pi R².

So:

(0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 pi R² (6000^4) )

The pi R² terms cancel:

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) / (4 *6000^4 )

= (0.4 /4 ) * ( (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4.

0.8333^2 is about 0.6944, so squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 =0.5177.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.05177, so 5.177% or ~5.18%.

Wait, same as before.

So the dip from the spots is about 5.18%.

The dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So set that equal to 0.0518.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

So Rp ≈ 0.2276 Rstar.

But looking at the options:

A) ~0.39: 0.39^2 is about 0.15, which is 15%, which is higher than 5%, so no.

B) 0.07: 0.07^2 is 0.0049, about 0.5%, way too small.

C) 0.11: 0.0121, about 1.2%, also too small.

D) 0.32: 0.32^2=0.1024, about 10%, which is still higher than 5%.

Wait, none of the options are close to 0.23. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the area. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun. Rstar = R_sun.

The spots cover one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere area.

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So the area is correct.

Wait, but wait—when the star rotates, the entire hemisphere of spots comes into view. So perhaps the maximum change in flux is when all the spots are visible, which is when the entire hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but no—previous calculation already accounts for the entire spotted area. Because when the hemisphere is viewed, we see all the spots, so the total area is 0.4 pi R².

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's total flux and the reduction when spots are visible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots, and then compute the difference in flux per unit area.

Wait, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (area of spots) / (total area of star).

The area of the star is 4 pi R². So the fraction is (0.4 pi R² ) / (4 pi R² ) ) = 0.4 pi / 4 pi = 0.4 /4 = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, wait, wait. So the area of spots is 0.4 pi R². The area of the entire star is 4 pi R². So the fraction is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface.

So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface. Because the hemisphere is 50% of the surface, and 20% of the hemisphere is spots, so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, 10%.

So the fraction is 10% or 0.1.

So the average brightness when spots are present would be:

(1 - f) * F0 + f * F1,

where f is the fraction of the area covered by spots (0.1), and F1 is the flux per unit area of the spots, and F0 is the flux per unit area of the rest.

F0 = sigma Teff^4.

F1 = sigma (Teff - delta T)^4.

So the relative change in flux is F = F0 * ( (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 )

So delta F / F0 = (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta T)/Teff )^4 - 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the total flux is F_total = (1-f)*F0 + f * F1.

F0 is the normal flux per unit area, F1 is the spot's flux per unit area.

So delta F is F_total - F0 (the change when spots are present).

So delta F = F_total - F0 = (1-f) F0 + f F1 - F0 = [ (1-f) F0 - F0 ] + f F1 = (-f F0) + f F1 = f (F1 - F0).

So delta F / F0 = f (F1 - F0)/F0 = f ( (F1/F0) - 1 )

F1/F0 = (T_spot / T_eff )^4.

So:

delta_F/F0 = f [ (T_spot / T_eff )^4 - 1 ]

But wait, since T_spot is less than T_eff, this value will be negative, indicating a decrease in flux.

So the relative change is delta F / F0 = f ( (T_spot / T_eff )^4 - 1 )

So the amplitude of the light curve is |delta_F / F0|, which is f ( 1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.1 (10% coverage)

T_spot = 5000 K.

Teff =6000 K.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177, or 5.177%.

Same as before.

So the relative change is about 5.18%. So the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2 must equal 0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest option would be A: ~0.39, D: ~0.32.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the calculation of the area. Because perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to only cover a part of the visible hemisphere as seen from Earth. Wait, but I thought we considered the entire hemisphere of spots being visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational modulation, so the maximum change is when half of the spots are visible. No—the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire 20% of that hemisphere (which is 10% of the total area) is visible. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a planet radius ratio of ~0.227. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the change in flux is the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in their brightness compared to the rest of the star.

The area of the spots is 0.1 (10%) of the star's surface.

The brightness of each spot is (5000/6000)^4 = ~0.4823.

So each square meter of spot contributes 0.4823 times the flux of the surrounding area.

So the total flux when the spots are facing us is:

F_total = F0 * (1 - 0.1) + F0 * 0.1 * 0.4823.

= F0 [0.9 + 0.04823] = F0 * 0.94823.

So the relative change is 0.94823 F0 - F0 = -0.05177 F0, so 5.177% dip.

Which is the same as before.

So the dip is ~5.18%.

So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.0518)=~0.227.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 0.39, option D: 0.32. Hmm, none match. Did I get something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. Maybe the star's brightness variation is due to the changing area of the spots that are visible as the star rotates. Wait, but the problem states that one hemisphere is covered, so when that hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible, and when it's not, none are. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but wait, the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into view, so the brightness variation would be sinusoidal, with a maximum amplitude when the spots are fully visible. But perhaps the star is rotating such that the spots are only partially visible in the observed hemisphere.

Wait, no. The problem statement says that only one hemisphere is spotted. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are entirely visible. So the maximum dip is 5.177%.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is twice the dip because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, it's higher. But that doesn't make sense because the star's other hemisphere isn't covered with spots, so it's at full brightness. So the average brightness would be between F0 and F0 - delta F.

Wait, perhaps the mean brightness is (F0 - delta F), and when the other hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is F0. So the variation would be from F0 - delta F to F0. So the amplitude would be delta F / 2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F0 - delta F. When the other hemisphere (non-spotted) is visible, the flux is F0. So the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is F0 - delta F. So the amplitude (half the peak-to-peak variation) would be (delta F)/2.

Wait, but in the case of a planet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which is the full dip. So when comparing the two situations, perhaps the amplitude of the star's variation (from spots) is delta F, and the planet's is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So to have the same amplitude, set delta F = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but earlier calculation said delta F is 5.177% of F0.

But if the observed amplitude is the dip, then it's delta F, right? So the planet would have a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈0.227.

But the options don't have that. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the area of the spots? Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and one hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.

Oh wait! Hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the area is 2 pi R².

Filling factor is 20% of that area. So the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So the fraction of the total star's area covered is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.4/4 = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is here. Oh! Because when the star rotates, only part of the spotted hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, the problem says the entire hemisphere is covered, so when it's facing us, all the spots are visible. But when the star rotates, perhaps the spots are on the limb and only part is visible. Hmm, but I think the question assumes that the entire hemisphere is either visible or not, leading to a maximum dip of 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but earlier calculations showed that the dip is about 5.18%, which comes from 10% of the star's surface being 20% less bright.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the temperature difference is 1000 K, but the spot's effective temperature is 5000 K, which is a 16.67% drop in temperature. The flux per unit area goes down by (5/6)^4, which is about 0.482, as I calculated.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the star's overall brightness.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation caused by the spots as the star rotates, leading to a varying amount of spots in the observed hemisphere.

Wait, no, because the problem says that one hemisphere is entirely covered, so when that hemisphere is visible, the entire spots are present, leading to a maximum dip. When the other hemisphere is visible, the spots are on the far side, so no dip. So the light curve would have a maximum dip of 5.18%, and the brightness would return to F0 when the other hemisphere is visible.

So the amplitude is 5.18%.

So the planet's transit would need to cause a 5.18% dip. Hence, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp = 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A (0.39) which squared is 0.152, which is about 15%, way higher. Option D is 0.32, which squared is 0.1024, about 10%, also higher.

Wait, perhaps I flipped the problem. Maybe the spots cause a larger dip than the planet, so the planet's dip would be smaller. But no, the question says to produce the same amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the delta F calculation. Let me recompute (T_spot / T_eff)^4.

T_spot is 5000 K, T_eff is 6000 K.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4.

Compute 5/6 squared: (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈0.6944.

Now square that: (25/36)^2 = 625/1296 ≈0.4823.

So yes, (5/6)^4 ≈0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by f (0.1): 0.05177, which is about 5.177%.

Thus, the answer should be Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈0.227.

But again, looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the star rotates, but the entire spotted area is not visible at once. Maybe the spots are on the equator, and as the star rotates, only a portion of the spots come into view, leading to a varying coverage.

Wait, but the problem states that the entire hemisphere is covered, so when the hemisphere is facing us, all spots are visible. So the calculation should be correct.

But let's consider the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relative flux calculation. Let me re-express everything:

The star's flux without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4.

The flux with spots is F = (1-f) F0 + f F1, where F1 is the flux per unit area of the spots.

F1 = sigma T_spot^4.

So F = F0 (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) F0.

= F0 [ (1-f) + f (T_spot/Teff)^4 ]

So the relative change is (F - F0) / F0 = [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ] - 1 = -f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ].

So the dip is f ( 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ).

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177.

So, yes, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the star's brightness variation is double this, because when the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness drops, and when it goes away, it rises, leading to a peak-to-peak variation of 2 * 5.177% = ~10.35%. So the amplitude is half of that, about 5.177%.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak divided by two. So the amplitude is 5.177%.

So the planet's transit would have a dip of 5.177%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈0.227.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question's understanding.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. Or is it 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K? Yes.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the variation as the sum of the entire hemisphere's contribution, but I think I did that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the difference in luminosity as:

L_spot = 4 pi R² * ( (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) )

Wait, no, that wouldn't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the change in brightness as a function of the area and temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a fraction of the star's luminosity.

The star's total luminosity is L =4 pi R² sigma Teff^4.

The spots contribute L_spot = area_spots * sigma T_spot^4.

So the change in luminosity when the spots are facing us is delta L = L - L_spot.

So delta L = 4 pi R² sigma Teff^4 - area_spots sigma T_spot^4.

The relative change is delta L / L = [4 pi R² Teff^4 - area_spots T_spot^4 ] / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

= 1 - (area_spots T_spot^4) / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

The area_spots is 0.4 pi R².

So:

delta L / L = 1 - (0.4 pi R² T_spot^4 ) / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

= 1 - (0.4 T_spot^4 )/(4 Teff^4 )

= 1 - (0.1 T_spot^4 )/(Teff^4 )

= 1 - 0.1 (T_spot / Teff )^4.

Which is the same as before.

So again, delta L / L = 1 - 0.1*(5/6)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.1 *0.4823 = 1 -0.04823=0.95177.

So the dip is 0.04823, about 4.823%.

Wait, wait, wait, that's different from the previous calculation. Did I do this correctly?

Wait, no, because delta L/L is the change when the spots are present. So when the spots are visible, the flux is L - delta L.

Wait, no, no. Let me re-express.

When the spots are visible, the flux is L - (area spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) * sigma.

So the fraction of the star's surface covered is f = area_spots / (4 pi R²).

So the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot / Teff )^4 )

Wait, yes, which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 10% (0.1). Each spot has a flux of (5/6)^4 of the surrounding. So the average flux is (0.9 * 1) + (0.1 * 0.4823) = 0.9 +0.04823=0.94823.

So the relative flux is 0.94823 of the original. So the dip is 1 - 0.94823=0.05177, which is about 5.18%.

So, same conclusion.

Given that, but none of the options match, perhaps the question is asking for the planet's radius in terms of the spot's radius.

Wait, no, the question is asking the exoplanet's radius relative to the host star.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves the star's rotation period and the duration of the transit, but I don't think that's the case. The question is only about the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the star's brightness variation is the same as the planet's. Maybe the star's variation is larger, so the planet needs to be smaller to have the same amplitude.

Wait, no, the problem says to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. The star's brightness variation is due to the spots, and the planet's variation would be (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177)= ~0.227. So about 0.227 Rstar.

But none of the options are close. The options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the star's variation is due to the spots being on the surface, and the way the light curve varies is not just the dip but the overall change. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of the flux from the spots and the rest of the star, leading to a varying brightness as the star rotates, but I think I accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the spot's area. Let me think: the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire 10% of the star's surface is covered in spots. So the dip is 5.177%.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's brightness has a baseline that is higher when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the amplitude would be the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is F0. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is F0 - delta F.

So the maximum brightness is F0, the minimum is F0 - delta F.

So the peak-to-peak variation is delta F, and the amplitude (which is half the peak-to-peak) is delta F / 2.

Wait, no—amplitude is usually the maximum deviation from the mean. In this case, the mean brightness would be somewhere between F0 and F0 - delta F.

Wait, no, when the star is viewed, the brightness alternates between F0 (non-spotted hemisphere) and (F0 - delta F) (spotted hemisphere). So the average brightness would be (F0 + (F0 - delta F )) / 2 = F0 - delta F / 2.

The maximum deviation is from the average. So when the brightness is F0, the deviation is F0 - (F0 - delta F/2 )= delta F/2.

When the brightness is F0 - delta F, the deviation is (F0 - delta F ) - (F0 - delta F/2 )= - delta F/2.

So the amplitude is delta F / 2.

So the amplitude is 5.177% / 2 = ~2.588%.

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the full dip as the amplitude, but actually, the amplitude is half that.

Because the light curve oscillates between F0 and F0 - delta F. The average is F0 - delta F/2. So the maximum deviation from average is delta F/2.

So the amplitude is about 2.588%.

If that's the case, then the planet's transit dip would need to have an amplitude of 2.588%, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.02588.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.02588) ≈ 0.1608.

Still, that's not matching any options either.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation is due to the rotational modulation of the spots. So the observed light curve would have a dip of 5.18% when the spots are facing us, and a peak when the other hemisphere is facing us. So the peak-to-peak variation is 5.18%.

The amplitude is usually the maximum deviation from the mean. So if the light curve goes from F0 to F0 - delta F, and the mean is F0 - delta F/2, then the amplitude is delta F/2.

So in that case, the amplitude is about 2.588%. So the planet's transit dip should have the same amplitude, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.02588 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.1608.

But the options don't have that either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the peak-to-peak variation as the amplitude, not the half-amplitude. So if the peak-to-peak is 5.177%, then the amplitude is that. So the planet's dip should be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177, Rp=0.227 Rstar.

But again, options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem differently. Let me think about the actual light curve of a star with spots. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, leading to a periodic dimming and brightening. The amplitude of the light curve is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

In this case, the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (F0), and the minimum is when all the spots are visible (F0 - delta F). So the peak-to-peak amplitude is delta F, about 5.177%.

So to find a planet that causes a dip of the same amplitude, the dip must be 5.177%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp = 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the spots. The area of the spots is 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

The area of the planet is pi Rp^2.

The ratio is (pi Rp^2) / (0.4 pi Rstar^2) ) = (Rp^2) / (0.4 Rstar^2) ).

Set this equal to 1 (since the planet's area is same as the spots' area?), but that would be incorrect because the planet blocks light, while the spots reduce the star's emission.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find Rp such that the area of the planet is the same as the area of the spots. But that would mean Rp^2 =0.4 Rstar^2 → Rp/Rstar= sqrt(0.4)≈0.632. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but that's not the case. The planet's effect is a dip in flux equal to the area blocked multiplied by the star's flux. The spots' effect is a dip in flux equal to the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

So the two effects are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is comparing the dip in flux caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots, and not considering the variation amplitude.

Wait, another approach: the flux from the star is F = 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4.

The flux blocked by the planet is F_planet = 4 pi Rp^2 sigma Teff^4.

So the dip is F_planet / F = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The dip caused by the spots is delta F / F = f (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = f (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

With f=0.1 and (5/6)^4≈0.4823.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 * (1 - 0.4823 )=0.05177.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177 ) ≈0.227.

Again, about 0.227, not matching any option.

Hmm. But the options presented are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total area of the spots and the planet's area.

The area of the spots is 0.4 pi R².

The area of the planet is pi Rp^2.

Set pi Rp^2 = 0.4 pi R² → Rp^2=0.4 R² → Rp= sqrt(0.4) R ≈0.632 R. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness difference per unit area.

The planet blocks a part of the star, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The spots cause a dip of f (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ) ≈0.05177.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.05177 → Rp=0.227 R.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of f. Let me recheck:

The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Hemisphere area is 2 pi R².

So area of spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The area of the star is 4 pi R².

So the fraction f is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R²=0.1.

So f=0.1.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's temperature difference as a 1000 K decrease, but perhaps I should compute the flux difference correctly.

The flux from a spot is sigma T_spot^4 per unit area.

The normal flux is sigma Teff^4 per unit area.

So the difference per unit area is sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the total dip is (area_spots) * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (4 pi R² sigma Teff^4 )

Which simplifies to (area_spots)/(4 pi R² ) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

= f * (1 - (T_spot / Teff )^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So, same result.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where I went wrong. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's brightness variation is not just the dip but the change in the star's overall brightness as the spots rotate into and out of view. So the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

In that case, the amplitude would be delta F =5.177%.

So the planet's dip would need to be the same, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.05177 → Rp=0.227 R.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's rotation and the duration of the spots being in view, but that affects the shape of the light curve, not the amplitude.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the sum of the flux from both hemispheres. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the brightness variation due to the spots being on one hemisphere, leading to a variation in brightness as seen from Earth. But I think I accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's light curve will have a variation of twice the dip because when the star rotates, the spots come in and out, leading to a sinusoidal variation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I think. Let me try to compute (Rp/Rstar) from the options given.

The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Assuming that Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.05177)= ~0.227, which is between options C and D. But none match exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's area.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire spotted area as being on the equator, so when the star rotates, only a fraction of the spots are visible at any given time, leading to a varying area. But that complicates the problem, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's temperature as 1000 K, but that can't be right because the star's Teff is 6000 K. So spots would be 5000 K, as I used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K, but perhaps I should use the ratio (5000/6000)^2 instead of the fourth power. No, because flux is proportional to T^4.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the flux from the spots to the flux from the rest of the star.

Flux ratio per unit area: (5000/6000)^4 = 0.4823.

So the spot's area contributes 0.4823 times the normal flux.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1-f) + F0 * f * 0.4823.

= F0 [1 - f + 0.4823 f ]

= F0 [1 - f (1 - 0.4823) ]

= F0 [1 - f * 0.5177 ]

f=0.1, so F = F0 * (1 -0.05177) = F0 * 0.94823.

So the dip is 5.177%.

Thus, the planet's dip must be same, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈0.227.

But no option matches. So perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, but that gives a dip of ~0.39^2=0.152 or 15.2%, which is larger than the 5.177% dip.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11, which would correspond to a 1.21% dip. But that's much smaller than 5.177%.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of 5/6^4.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4)=625/1296≈0.48225.

Yes.

So, I'm confident that the dip is about 5.18%, leading to Rp=0.227 R.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, but that would cause a much larger dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the spot's radius relative to the star, but that doesn't fit the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots plus the rest of the star, but I think I accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's effective temperature is the average of the spots and the rest. But that's not correct, because the effective temperature is an average.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I calculate the flux. Let me think: when the spots are present, the flux is less. So the dip in flux is the difference between the normal flux and the flux with spots.

The normal flux per unit area: F0 = sigma Teff^4.

The flux from the spots per unit area: F1 = sigma T_spot^4.

The area of the spots is A =0.4 pi Rstar^2.

So the total flux when spots are visible: F = (4 pi Rstar^2 - A ) * F0 + A F1.

= (4 pi R² -0.4 pi R² ) * sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma T_spot^4.

= (3.6 pi R²) sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma T_spot^4.

The normal flux is 4 pi R² sigma Teff^4.

So the dip is F_normal - F = 4 pi R² sigma Teff^4 - [3.6 pi R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma T_spot^4 ]

= (0.4 pi R² sigma ) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the relative dip is (0.4 pi R² sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R² sigma Teff^4 )

= 0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (4 Teff^4 )

= 0.1 (1 - (T_spot / Teff )^4 )

Which is the same as before: 0.1 * 0.5177 =5.177%.

So, same result.

I think I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to Rp/Rstar≈0.227, but the options don't include this. Perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, but that would mean a much larger dip. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute (Rp/Rstar) as sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.227, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) ~0.39, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's radius relative to the star's radius in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

Planet area: pi Rp^2.

Star area: 4 pi Rstar^2.

Ratio: (Rp^2)/(4 Rstar^2) ) = (Rp/(2 Rstar))^2.

Set this equal to 0.05177 → (Rp/(2 Rstar))^2=0.05177 → Rp/(2 Rstar)=sqrt(0.05177)=0.227 → Rp=0.454 Rstar.

Which is much larger than the options, so not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's radius as a fraction of the spotted area.

But that would be (Rp^2)/(0.4 pi R^2) )= (Rp^2)/(0.4 R^2) ) = (Rp/R)^2 / 0.4.

Set equal to 1: (Rp/R)^2=0.4 → Rp=0.632 R. Again, not matching options.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm not making progress. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is A) ~0.39, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation, and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, let me re-express the problem. Perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, which cause a dip of 5.177%, and the planet would need to cause the same dip. So the planet's radius is sqrt(0.05177) Rstar ≈0.227 Rstar.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the planet's radius as the square root of the amplitude, so sqrt(0.05177)=0.227, but perhaps the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spots' area. Let me recheck.

Hemisphere area: 2 pi R².

Filling factor: 20% → 0.2.

So area of spots: 0.2 * 2 pi R² =0.4 pi R².

Star's total area:4 pi R².

So fraction f=0.4 pi R² /4 pi R²=0.1.

Yes.

Hmm.

Well, given the options, the closest to 0.227 is option A) 0.39, but that's about 0.39. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the radius of the planet such that the area blocked is the same as the area of the spots, leading to Rp^2=0.4 Rstar^2 → Rp=0.632 Rstar. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the brightness variation caused by the planet being the same as the star's. The star's variation is due to the spots, which cause a dip of 5.177%.

So, planet's dip (Rp/Rstar)^2=5.177% → Rp=0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's radius as twice that of the Sun, but the question says the star has a radius equal to the Sun.

Hmm. Well, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but given the available options, the closest is option A) ~0.39, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.05177.

Wait, 0.05177 is approximately 5.177%. So sqrt(0.05177)=0.2276.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius in terms of the spot's radius. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the spot's diameter.

But I think I'm stuck. I'll go with the calculation I have, which suggests Rp/Rstar≈0.227, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for (Rspot/Rstar), the radius of the spots relative to the star. But that's not what the question asks. The question asks for the planet's radius relative to the star.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the radius of the spots. The area of the spots is 0.4 pi Rstar². Assuming the spots are circular, the radius of a single spot (if there were just one) would be sqrt( (0.4 pi Rstar² ) / (pi) ) )= sqrt(0.4) Rstar= ~0.632 Rstar. But that's not relevant to the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the planet's radius such that the area blocked is equal to the area of the spots, but that would be Rp=0.632 Rstar, which is not an option.

I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation as is, despite the options not matching. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star's radius such that the brightness variation caused by the planet's transit matches the brightness variation caused by the star's dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), giving them a temperature of \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Area of the Spots**:  
   The total surface area of the star is \( 4 \pi R^2 \). The area of one hemisphere is \( 2 \pi R^2 \). With a filling factor of 20%, the area of the spots is:  
   \[
   A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R^2 = 0.4 \pi R^2
   \]  
   The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:  
   \[
   f = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4 \pi R^2} = \frac{0.4 \pi R^2}{4 \pi R^2} = 0.1
   \]

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The flux per unit area of the star is proportional to \( T^4 \). The normal flux per unit area is \( \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), and the flux from the spots is \( \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \). The relative brightness change when the spots are visible is:  
   \[
   \Delta F / F = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
   \]  
   Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( f = 0.1 \):  
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta F / F = 0.1 \times (1 - 0.4823) = 0.1 \times 0.5177 = 0.05177 \, \text{(or 5.177%)}.
   \]

3. **Planet's Radius for the Same Amplitude**:  
   The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( (R_p / R_{\text{star}})^2 \). To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, set:  
   \[
   (R_p / R_{\text{star}})^2 = \Delta F / F = 0.05177
   \]  
   Solving for \( R_p / R_{\text{star}} \):  
   \[
   R_p / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.227
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (~0.39)**: This corresponds to a brightness variation of \( (0.39)^2 \approx 0.152 \) or 15.2%, which is much larger than the calculated 5.177%.  
- **Option B (~0.07)**: This corresponds to a brightness variation of \( (0.07)^2 \approx 0.0049 \) or 0.49%, which is much smaller than the calculated 5.177%.  
- **Option C (~0.11)**: This corresponds to a brightness variation of \( (0.11)^2 \approx 0.0121 \) or 1.21%, which is also much smaller than the calculated 5.177%.  
- **Option D (~0.32)**: This corresponds to a brightness variation of \( (0.32)^2 \approx 0.1024 \) or 10.24%, which is larger than the calculated 5.177%.

### Conclusion:
The calculated value \( R_p / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A (~0.39)**, though it overestimates the required brightness variation. Given the available choices, **A** is the most reasonable answer despite the discrepancy.

Answer: A
