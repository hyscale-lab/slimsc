Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's, but I don't think the masses matter directly for the ratio of silicon. The problem is about their elemental abundances.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Wait, [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) relative to the Sun. So this star has 10^0.3 times more Si relative to Fe than the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Star 2 has Mg/Si ratio 10^0.3 times the solar ratio.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. Fe abundance relative to H is the same as solar. So Star 1's Fe/H is solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Similarly, Star 2's Mg/H is solar.

The Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Hmm, that's 3.16e-5 approximately.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5.

Wait, so Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, which is the same as [Fe/H]_1. So Star 1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. But [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So that means the Si is higher relative to Fe in Star 1.

Let me think. The way to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars is to find [Si/H] for each, then take their ratio.

Wait, because the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So (n_Si1 / n_Si2) ?

Alternatively, perhaps it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the ratio is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

So I need to compute [Si/H] for each star, then find the ratio.

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe/H is solar.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Si is 2 times more than Fe in Star 1.

But since Fe/H is the same as solar, then what is Si/H?

Because [Si/Fe] = log(Si/Fe) - log(Sun_Si/Sun_Fe). So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si1/Fe1) = log(Sun_Si/Sun_Fe) + 0.3.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is let's compute it. Sun's n_Si/n_Fe = (n_Si / H) / (n_Fe / H) * (Fe/Si) → Wait, no, perhaps better to compute it from the given data.

Wait, Sun's nFe/nH = 3.16e-5, as I figured before. Sun's Mg/nH is 1e-5.

Wait, but I don't have the Sun's n_Si/nH. Hmm. Wait, the problem gives [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2, so maybe I can compute the ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for both stars.

For Star 1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = Solar.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe) = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So if Fe/H is solar, then Si/H = (Fe/H) * (Si/Fe) → (Solar_Fe/H) * (2) = 2 * Solar_Si/H?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of log.

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 → because [X/H] = [X/Fe] + [Fe/H].

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star 2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg/H = Solar_Mg/H = 1e-5.

So, Mg/Si = (Mg/H) / (Si/H) = 2.

So, 1e-5 / (Si/H)_2 = 2 → (Si/H)_2 = 1e-5 / 2 ≈ 5e-6.

In log terms, [Si/H]_2 is log( (5e-6) / (Sun_Si/H) ) → Wait, wait no, [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - 12.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → so [Fe/H]_sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5? No, wait, no, the way it's given:

For the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5. So [Fe/H]_sun is 0, because in the star's terms, it's [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH)_sun - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. Wait, no. Wait, the [Fe/H] value is log(nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun is zero.

Similarly for [Mg/H]_sun: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → [Mg/H]_sun = log(nMg/nH) - log(nMg/nH)_sun = 0.

Ah, right. So [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio (n_X/n_H) in the star divided by (n_X/n_H) in the Sun.

So, in Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Similarly, Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-5.

So, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Wait, because [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun).

But wait, n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * n_H2 / n_H_sun → because [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2 → because [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2/n_H2) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) = ?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3 → n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But since n_Mg2 = [Mg/H]_2 + [Mg/H]_sun → no, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → so n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

So n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * (n_H2 / n_H2) ) → n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would make [Mg/Si]_2 =0, but according to the problem it's 0.3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 is given as 0.3. So:

[Mg/Si]_2 = log( n_Mg2 / n_Si2 ) - log( n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun ) = 0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun).

But from [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

Similarly, n_Si2 = n_Si_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * (n_H2 / n_H2) = n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun.

Wait, that implies that [Mg/Si]_2 =0, which contradicts the given 0.3.

Hmm, that suggests I'm not thinking correctly. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps the [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, which is the logarithm of (n_Mg2/n_Si2) divided by (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) equals 0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun).

But from [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) * (n_H2 /n_H2) ) → (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun).

Wait, that's the same as before. So according to this, [Mg/Si]_2 would be 0, but it's given as 0.3. So this suggests an error in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → which is log(n_Si1/n_H1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )=0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

We need to find [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3.

Because [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

Wait, no. Let's see: [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

We know [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Now, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

The ratio (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) → log(nX/nY) = [X/Y].

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1 /n_H1 ) - log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )= 0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2 /n_H2 ) - log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6.

Thus, log(n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = 0.6 → n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, so the answer would be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between logarithmic abundances.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe) = 0.3 → Si/Fe = \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = Solar Fe/H.
   - Using the relationship \([X/H] = [X/Fe] + [Fe/H]\), we find \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(Mg/Si) = 0.3 → Mg/Si = \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\).
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H = Solar Mg/H.
   - Using the relationship \([Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]\), we solve for \([Si/H]_2\):
     \[
     0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 \implies [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.
     \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3, \quad [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3 \implies [\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2 = 0.6.
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \approx 4.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**. This corresponds to **Option A**.
