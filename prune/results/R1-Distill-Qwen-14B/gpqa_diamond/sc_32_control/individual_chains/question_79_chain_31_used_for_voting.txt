Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. The compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given.

Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Oh right, it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait, no—Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides in specific stereochemistry. Or maybe it's for other types of epoxide formation. Wait, actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base and is used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes. Oh right, this is the type of reaction where an alkene reacts with an oxidizing agent to form an epoxide. So, the starting compound X probably has a double bond which is being epoxidized.

So, the product after reaction would be an epoxide. So the product is an epoxide, and the NMR data is of the epoxide.

Looking at the options, they are all epoxide derivatives. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure-wise, that would be a styrene group (vinyl benzene) attached to an epoxide. The styryl is at position 4 of the benzene, so the substituent is in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Hmm, so the substituent is a propr-1-en-2-yl group attached to the epoxide. So the structure would be a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group attached to the epoxide. Wait, but the numbering might be different. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the oxygen is at C2?

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide ring has substituents at positions 2 and 3. At position 2, a methyl group, and at position 3, a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the structure is like O in the epoxide, with a methyl on one carbon and a styryl on the adjacent.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That would be the styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached directly to the epoxide oxygen. So the epoxide oxygen is connected to a benzene ring via a vinyl group.

Wait, but epoxide is a three-membered ring with two oxygen atoms? No, wait, epoxide is an oxygen in a three-membered ring. So structure-wise, the epoxide is O connected to two carbons, which are each connected to other groups.

So the product is an epoxide. The starting material must have had a double bond that was epoxidized.

So, the NMR data is for the product, which is an epoxide. So the product's structure must be one of the options given, and we need to match the NMR data to that.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s),
6.75 (1H, d),
7.08 (2H, d),
7.68 (1H, d),
7.71 (2H, d).

So, 2 singlets around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. These are likely methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring or perhaps carbonyl groups, but in this case, maybe attached to a sp3 hybridized carbon.

Wait, singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So each methyl is attached to a carbon that's not next to any other protons.

In the aromatic region, we have a triplet of signals. Let's look at them:

At 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d,1H), and 7.71 (d, 2H). Hmm. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the numbers: 1, 2,1,2 H each. So perhaps a para-disubstituted aromatic ring? Let's think. For example, a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring could lead to coupling between protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure has two different aromatic environments. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a styryl group.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s),
126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s),
129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s),
141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s),
197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, carbon shifts: 21.3 and 28.4 are probably CH3 groups. 126.9, 127.1, etc., are aromatic carbons. 197.7 is a carbonyl carbon, but wait, the product is an epoxide. Epoxide carbons are typically around 60-70 ppm. Hmm, but 197.7 is a carbonyl. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait, the product is an epoxide, which has two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. So in the 13C NMR, we should see those carbons. But in the data, there's a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl, but that doesn't fit with an epoxide. Hmm, perhaps that's a different group.

Wait, but the product is an epoxide, so where does the 197.7 come from? That seems really high for a carbon. Maybe a carbonyl group, but that would suggest a ketone or ester, which isn't expected here. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl in the starting material but not the product? No, the product is the epoxide. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was a ketone or something else. But the reaction is epoxidation, which implies adding an oxygen across a double bond. So the product would have an epoxide group.

Wait, looking again at the 13C NMR:

The 197.7 is a singlet, so it's a single carbon. That's a really high value, maybe a carbonyl. But in an epoxide, the carbons are typically around 50-60 ppm. So why is there a carbonyl here?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure. If the starting compound X has a carbonyl group, and the reaction forms an epoxide elsewhere. But no, the product is an epoxide. Wait, the 13C NMR may not be from the product but from the starting material? No, the question says the product's theoretical NMR is given.

Hmm, perhaps the 197.7 is an epoxide carbon? No, I think epoxide carbons are lower. Wait, let me check typical shifts:

Epoxide carbons (each of the two CH2 groups adjacent to O) are around 50-60 ppm. The carbonyl (like ketones) are around 200 ppm. So 197.7 is likely a carbonyl.

Wait, that's conflicting because the product is an epoxide. Unless... Wait, perhaps the reaction didn't form an epoxide but something else. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. That's a base, and in what solvent? The solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K, which is about 130°C. So that's a high temperature, possibly an acid-catalyzed reaction, but the reagent is a base. Wait, maybe it's an epoxidation via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material X is an epoxide, and the reaction does something else. But that doesn't fit with the options given. All the options are epoxides with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene that forms an epoxide. Hmm, no, the product is the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reaction forms an epoxide elsewhere. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 197.7 is a carbonyl group in another part of the molecule, not the epoxide.

Looking at the 13C NMR data: 21.3 and 28.4 are two different CH3 groups. 126.9 (2C, s) – perhaps two equivalent aromatic carbons. 127.1 (1C, s) – one aromatic carbon. 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s) – more aromatic carbons. 141.5 and 144.1 are probably carbons attached to oxygen, like in an epoxide.

Wait, the 141.5 and 144.1 ppm are typical for carbons adjacent to oxygen, such as in an epoxide. So those might be the two carbons in the epoxide ring. So each would be around 140 ppm.

Then the high shift at 197.7: perhaps a carbonyl group in the molecule. But that's confusing because the product is an epoxide. Does that mean the starting material had a carbonyl that's still present, or is that part of the product?

Wait, the product is an epoxide. So where does 197.7 come from? Maybe it's a carbonyl from another part of the molecule, but that doesn't fit with an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong structure. Maybe the epoxide is part of a ring, and another part is a carbonyl. But the starting material would have to have a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O. The product would be C11H10O2 perhaps, if epoxidation adds an oxygen. Wait, wait, the formula of the product isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a base. So perhaps it's an elimination reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol, and the reagent is forming an epoxide. But no, the starting material formula is C11H12O, which would have a degree of unsaturation of (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees of unsaturation: probably a ring and a double bond, or three rings, etc.

Wait, the product's formula isn't given, so perhaps I'm stuck on that.

Let me look at the options again and see their structures.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure is an epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached to one of the epoxide carbons. The styryl is para-methyl. So the structure would be O in the epoxide, one side is connected to a benzene ring via a CH2-CH2 group? Or wait, styryl is CH2=CHPh. So the epoxide would have one carbon connected to CH2-CHPh and another connected to a methyl.

Wait, no, the structure is oxirane (epoxide) where one of the carbons is connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. So, the styryl is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3 (para). So, the epoxide is attached to that.

In that case, the NMR would have signals for the aromatic protons. Let's think about the H NMR.

The 1H NMR of the product has:

At 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, two singlets, each 3H. Those would correspond to two methyl groups. In option A, the styryl group is 4-methyl, so that would be one methyl on the benzene. But where is the other methyl? Maybe the epoxide has a methyl group attached. So if the epoxide is at position 2 of the styryl, then the other substituent is a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the epoxide is attached to a CH2 group which is adjacent to another CH2. Wait, perhaps the epoxide is in the middle. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me think about the 1H NMR:

The aromatic region: we have 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). So that's a total of 1+2+1+2=6 H in aromatic regions. That suggests two different aromatic rings or substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent on a benzene ring which causes coupling.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent are equivalent. So their chemical shifts would be the same. But in this NMR, I see 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d). So perhaps two para-substituted groups on a benzene ring, each causing their own doublets.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, with substituents in the para positions, each causing their own set of protons.

Wait, another possibility: the benzene ring has a substituent that's an epoxide, and another substituent elsewhere. But perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons split into these doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic system is more complex. Maybe the structure has a styryl group attached to the epoxide, which itself is part of a larger structure.

Let me think about the 13C NMR again. The 197.7 is a single carbon, and it's a singlet. So, perhaps it's a carbonyl group. But in the product, which is an epoxide, where would a carbonyl come from? That doesn't make sense unless the starting material had a carbonyl that's part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material had a ketone group, and the epoxidation adds an oxygen elsewhere. But how would that tie into the product's structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 isn't a carbonyl. Wait, other possibilities for high ppm in 13C NMR: maybe an ester or a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a quaternary carbon?

Wait, epoxide carbons are typically in the range of 50-70 ppm. The 141.5 and 144.1 are higher, more like carbons attached to oxygen, such as in an epoxide ring. So, the two carbons in the epoxide are probably around 140 ppm. That makes sense because epoxides have carbons adjacent to oxygen, which deshield them, leading to higher ppm.

So, the two carbons in the epoxide are at 141.5 and 144.1. Their integration is each 1C. So, that matches with the epoxide structure.

Now, the 13C NMR also shows 21.3 and 28.4, which are two different CH3 groups. So, where are these in the structure?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3 (para). So, the epoxide is attached to the CH2 group. So, the structure would be O-C-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH3. Wait, no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So, the structure would be O linked to two carbons, one of which is attached to the styryl group. So, one carbon in the epoxide is connected to the styryl (CH2CH2PhCH3?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the epoxide is attached to the CH2 group adjacent to the styryl.

But in that case, perhaps the structure has a methyl group on the aromatic ring (from the styryl) and another methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, looking at option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. The structure would be O connected to two carbons; one of them is connected to a CH2 group which is connected to a phenyl. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the epoxide has a methyl group on one carbon and a styryl on the adjacent. So, the structure would be O connected to C1 and C2; C1 has a methyl, C2 has a styryl (CH2=CHPh).

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. The epoxide has a styryl group attached directly, so O connected to a carbon which is connected to CH2-CHPh.

Wait, perhaps the structure can be better visualized as the epoxide being part of a larger molecule with substituents.

So, going back to the 1H NMR:

We have two methyl groups as singlets. So, each attached to a carbon without neighboring protons. So, perhaps each is attached to a quaternary carbon, maybe part of a benzene ring or something else.

In option A, the styryl group has a methyl in the para position, so that would contribute one methyl group. The other methyl group must be somewhere else. So, perhaps the epoxide is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH3, making a methyl group. So, in that case, the structure might have two methyl groups: one on the benzene (styryl) and another on the CH2 group next to the epoxide. That would account for the two singlets for CH3 groups.

In that case, the 1H NMR would show two singlets for 3H each. That matches the data.

Now, looking at the aromatic protons. The styryl group (CH2=CHPh) would have protons on the double bond and the benzene ring.

Wait, the double bond in the styryl group is between the CH2 and CHPh. So, the protons on the double bond would be split into a certain pattern.

But in the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are in the 6.75-7.71 range. So, perhaps the aromatic ring has substituents that cause the protons to split into the observed doublets.

Wait, let's think about a para-substituted benzene. If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, the protons adjacent would be deshielded, appearing downfield. Alternatively, if it's an electron-donating group, they would be upfield. But in this case, the substituent is part of the styryl group attached to the epoxide.

Hmm, perhaps the benzene ring is part of a styryl group attached to the epoxide. So, the epoxide is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to the benzene via a double bond (CH2-CHPh, where Ph is benzene).

In that case, the protons on the double bond (CH2=CHPh) would be split into a doublet of doublets or something else. But in the 1H NMR, we have a 1H as a doublet, 2H as a doublet, another 1H as a doublet, and another 2H as a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there are two different types of protons on the aromatic ring. For example, if the aromatic ring has substituents at the ortho and para positions, which could split the protons into different doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene, leading to coupling between the aromatic protons and the vinyl protons.

Wait, let's think about the splitting in the aromatic region. In a para-substituted styryl group, the aromatic protons would be split based on the substituent. For example, in para-methylstyrene, the aromatic protons are ortho to the substituent. So, the ortho protons would couple with each other and with the vinyl protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has two different substituents on the benzene ring, leading to two sets of doublets.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows four different sets of aromatic protons. So, perhaps the benzene ring is 1,4-disubstituted, and each substituent causes two doublets.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has two separate aromatic rings, but that's less likely since the molecular formula doesn't support it.

Let me think about the possibilities for each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: the epoxide is at position 2 of the styryl group. So, the styryl is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3. So, the epoxide oxygen is attached to the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2 - CH2 - C6H4-CH3

Wait, no, more accurately, the epoxide is O connected to two carbons. One of them is connected to the CH2 group, which is part of the styryl.

So, the structure is O connected to C1 and C2. C1 has a CH2 group attached to another CH2, which is connected to the benzene ring (styryl). So, C1 is connected to the epoxide and a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 which is part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine it as epoxide-O-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH3, but with a double bond somewhere. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C1 - C2
      |
      CH2
      |
CH2-CHPh (where Ph is benzene with a methyl in para)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the NMR signals.

In option A, the structure would have a para-methyl on the benzene. So, the aromatic protons in the benzene would be ortho and meta to the methyl, leading to specific splitting. Also, the double bond in the styryl group would have protons that are trans or cis, affecting their chemical shifts.

Wait, in the 1H NMR, there's a 1H and a 2H as doublets, and another 1H and 2H as doublets. That could correspond to the protons on the double bond and the aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring has substituents that cause the protons to split into these doublets.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of aromatic carbons in the 13C NMR. The 13C NMR shows:

126.9 (2C, s)
127.1 (1C, s)
129.1 (2C, s)
130.3 (1C, s)

Wait, that's 2+1+2+1=6 C's. That would suggest a benzene ring with substituents. So, perhaps a benzene ring with three substituents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a styryl group.

Wait, a benzene ring with two substituents would have four protons, split into two doublets. If the substituents are in the para positions, then each substituent would cause two equivalent protons on the ring, but they would couple with each other.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR has 126.9 (2C, s), which is two equivalent carbons. For a benzene ring, that might correspond to two carbons that are equivalent, perhaps in a para-substituted ring. So, the substituents would be in the para positions, making two sets of equivalent carbons.

Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the carbons adjacent to the substituent (ortho) would be equivalent. But in this case, the 13C NMR shows two different sets of aromatic carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, each causing their own set of signals.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has a total of 6 H. That suggests that there are two sets of three H each, but the integration given is 1,2,1,2, which adds up to 6 H. So, that could be two doublets each integrating for two H, and two doublets each for one H. Or perhaps, it's a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with two substituents, each causing their own set of doublets.

Wait, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, making a styryl group, and another substituent elsewhere.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about each option again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is O connected to two carbons, one of which is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a benzene ring. So, O-CH2-CH2-C6H5. Wait, no, that's a styryl group, which is CH2=CH-C6H5. So, the epoxide would be O connected to a CH2 group, which is part of a double bond (CH2=CH-C6H5).

In this case, the epoxide's adjacent CH2 group would have protons, but in the 1H NMR, the only CH2 groups are the two methyl singlets.

Wait, no, the epoxide in option D would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the O. So, each of those would be split into a triplet or something else, unless they're equivalent. But in the NMR, there are no signals around 3.5-4 ppm, which are typical for epoxide CH2 groups. Instead, the signals are at 2.28 and 2.31, which are for methyl groups.

Hmm, so in option D, there are no methyl groups. So, perhaps the two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 are from other parts of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, or perhaps the starting material had a methyl group that's not part of the epoxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product has both the epoxide and a carbonyl group. But that doesn't fit with the reaction conditions.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diastereomer, but that's probably not relevant here.

Going back to the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a problem. Maybe I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the 13C data includes the starting material's carbonyl, but that's not the case because the question states it's the product's data.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is part of the epoxide ring, but that doesn't make sense. Epoxides don't have carbonyls.

Wait, let me think again: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7. That's a carbonyl. How can that be in the product?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product is not an epoxide but an ester or a ketone. But the reaction is supposed to form an epoxide. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the molecular formula. The starting material is C11H12O. The product would have an epoxide, which would add an oxygen. So, product formula would be C11H10O2.

But the 13C NMR has 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product has both an epoxide and a ketone. But that would require the starting material to have a double bond and a ketone, which would make the formula C11H10O2.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. So, the product would be C11H10O2 if an epoxide is formed (since epoxidation adds an O). So, the product has two oxygen atoms.

But the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl, which would require another O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is part of the epoxide ring, but I don't think that's possible. Epoxide carbons are not carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl in the starting material, but that doesn't make sense because the product is an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong structure.

Let me think about the 1H NMR again. The two singlets for 3H each suggest two methyl groups. So, in the structure, there must be two methyl groups attached to a carbon that's not adjacent to any other H, like attached to a quaternary carbon.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The styryl has a para methyl (on the benzene ring). The epoxide is attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure would have a methyl on the benzene (one singlet) and another methyl group somewhere else. But I'm not seeing where the second methyl comes from in this option.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. The structure would be O connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH group (which is part of the propenyl group). The propenyl group is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. Wait, that would have two methyl groups? No, the propenyl would have a phenyl and two CH2 groups. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So, the structure is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So, the substituent has a central carbon connected to a phenyl group and two CH2 groups. So, perhaps the substituent is:

CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

So, the epoxide would have O connected to a CH2 and a CH group.

Wait, that would give a CH2 adjacent to the epoxide, which would have protons. But in the 1H NMR, the only CH2 groups are the two methyl singlets. So, perhaps this option doesn't explain the two CH3 singlets.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The epoxide has a methyl on one carbon and a styryl on the other. So, the structure would be O connected to C1 (CH3) and C2 (CH2=CHPh). So, the styryl is attached to C2, and C1 has a methyl group. So, that would account for the two methyl singlets: the one on C1 (as a singlet because it's attached to a quaternary carbon, perhaps) and the methyl on the benzene (from the styryl group).

So, in this case, the two CH3 groups would be from the methyl on the epoxide and the methyl on the benzene of the styryl.

That seems to fit because the 1H NMR shows two singlets for 3H each.

Now, looking at the aromatic protons in option C. The styryl group is attached to the epoxide as CH2=CHPh. So, the double bond protons would be on the CH2 and the CH groups. The CH2 would be adjacent to the epoxide, and the CH would be attached to the benzene.

In the 1H NMR, the doublets in the aromatic region could correspond to the protons on the styryl group.

So, for the styryl group, the double bond protons would be adjacent to the epoxide. The CH2 group would have protons that are split by the epoxide protons, but since the epoxide is a three-membered ring, the protons are deshielded and possibly split into doublets or other patterns.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the signals are 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), and 7.71 (d, 2H). So, that's 6 protons in total. If the styryl group contributes 3 H (two on the double bond and one on the benzene?), but that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, the benzene ring in the styryl group would have two substituents: one from the CH2 and another from the epoxide. Wait, no, the styryl is CH2=CHPh, so the benzene has a substituent at the para position (the CH2=CH group). So, the benzene ring would have a substituent at one position, making the ring have two ortho and two meta protons, but in this case, the substituent is a vinyl group, which can cause the ring protons to split.

Wait, perhaps the para-substituted benzene would have two sets of protons: the two ortho protons (each as a doublet), and the two meta protons (also as a doublet). But in the NMR, we have two doublets integrating for 2H each and two doublets for 1H each.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the coupling in the aromatic region. If the benzene ring has a substituent that's a vinyl group, the protons on the ring would be split into doublets due to coupling with the vinyl protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl protons are split into a triplet due to coupling with each other and the epoxide protons. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7. If the structure has a carbonyl, then perhaps it's a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't fit with an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the high shift is from a carbonyl in a different part of the molecule, but I can't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is an error, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 197.7 is from an ester group. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl from a different part of the molecule, but in the product.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to match the options to the NMR data.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: O connected to C1 (CH3) and C2 (CH2=CHPh).

So, the epoxide is between CH3 and CH2=CHPh.

The CH2=CHPh group would have protons on the double bond. The benzene ring attached to the CHPh would have protons.

So, in the 1H NMR:

- The methyl groups: CH3 (from C1) would be a singlet. The other CH3 is from the styryl's benzene (para position). So, that would be another singlet. So, two singlets for 3H each. That matches the data.

- The double bond protons on the styryl group: the CH2 and CHPh groups. The CH2 would be adjacent to the epoxide, so perhaps their protons would be split into a triplet or a quartet. But in the data, there are no signals in that region except the aromatic ones.

Wait, perhaps the double bond protons are deshielded and appear in the aromatic region. But typically, vinyl protons are around 5-6 ppm, but in some cases, they can be downfield. So, if the double bond is part of a conjugated system, the protons could appear downfield.

In the 1H NMR, the signals are 6.75 (d,1H), 7.08 (d,2H), 7.68 (d,1H), 7.71 (d,2H). So, that's 6 H in the aromatic region.

If the styryl group's double bond protons are in the aromatic region, perhaps they are coupled with the benzene protons, causing the observed splitting.

Alternatively, the two doublets for 2H each could correspond to the protons on the benzene ring, and the two doublets for 1H each could correspond to the double bond protons.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the coupling.

In a para-substituted benzene, the two ortho protons are equivalent and would couple with each other and with the substituent's protons. So, perhaps the two ortho protons would be a doublet of doublets, but in the data, they are each a doublet.

Wait, perhaps each substituent causes a set of protons to split into a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the doublets are from the vinyl protons, which are each coupled to one proton on the benzene.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here, but let me think about the integration.

In option C, the styryl group would have three protons on the double bond (CH2=CHPh). But wait, the CH2 would have two H, and the CHPh would have one H. So, in the NMR, perhaps the CH2 protons would appear as a doublet, and the CHPh as another.

But in the 1H NMR data, the aromatic region has four signals: two 2H doublets and two 1H doublets. That could correspond to the two protons on the benzene ring ortho to the substituent, and the two protons on the double bond (CH2 and CHPh), but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond protons are not part of the aromatic region but are in the 6-7 ppm range, which is possible.

But given the complexity, perhaps the correct option is C, 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, which explains the two methyl singlets and the aromatic protons.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR again, the 197.7 is still a problem. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is from the epoxide. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 197.7 is a carbonyl from a ketone in the starting material, but the product is the epoxide. That would mean the starting material had a carbonyl group, which is possible.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. If it's a ketone, then its formula would be CnH2nO. Wait, C11H12O would be a ketone because for a ketone, 2n=12 → n=6, but wait, the formula would be C6H12O, but here it's C11H12O. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a styrene derivative with a methyl group and a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make a decision based on the NMR data and the options.

The two methyl singlets in the 1H NMR suggest two CH3 groups attached to non-protonated carbons. Option C has a methyl on the epoxide and another on the styryl's benzene. That fits.

The 13C NMR's 197.7 would then be a mystery, but perhaps it's a typo or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is not part of the product but of the starting material. But the question states it's the product's data. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is an error, and I should proceed without it.

So, based on the 1H NMR matching the two methyl groups, and the structure of option C having two methyl groups (one on the epoxide and one on the styryl), I think option C is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting Compound X (C11H12O) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K for 1 day. The reaction likely forms an epoxide, as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base commonly used in epoxidation reactions. The NMR data provided corresponds to the product, which is an epoxide derivative.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets integrating to 3H each, indicating two methyl groups attached to carbons with no neighboring protons.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic region with four signals, suggesting a benzene ring with substituents causing splitting into doublets.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two distinct methyl carbons.
   - δ 126.9 (2C, s), δ 127.1 (1C, s), δ 129.1 (2C, s), δ 130.3 (1C, s): Aromatic carbons.
   - δ 141.5 (1C, s) and δ 144.1 (1C, s): Likely carbons in the epoxide ring.
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A high chemical shift, characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, which is unexpected for an epoxide product.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
   - This structure features a styryl group (CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3, para-substituted) attached to an epoxide.  
   - The para-methyl on the benzene would explain one methyl singlet, but the second methyl group is unclear, as the epoxide structure does not account for it.  
   - The aromatic protons would likely produce signals consistent with a para-substituted benzene, but the splitting pattern does not fully match the NMR data.

2. **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
   - This structure involves a propenyl group (CH2-C(Ph)=CH2) attached to the epoxide.  
   - The structure does not clearly account for the two methyl singlets in the 1H NMR. Additionally, the aromatic splitting pattern does not align with the observed NMR data.

3. **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
   - This structure features a methyl group on one carbon of the epoxide and a styryl group (CH2=CHPh) on the adjacent carbon.  
   - The methyl group on the epoxide and the methyl group on the benzene of the styryl group explain the two singlets in the 1H NMR (δ 2.28 and δ 2.31).  
   - The aromatic protons on the benzene ring would produce the observed doublets in the 1H NMR, consistent with a para-substituted benzene.  
   - The 13C NMR data, including the carbons in the epoxide ring and the aromatic carbons, aligns well with this structure. However, the high shift at δ 197.7 remains unexplained, possibly due to a carbonyl group in the starting material or an error.

4. **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
   - This structure features a styryl group (CH2=CHPh) directly attached to the epoxide.  
   - The structure does not account for the two methyl singlets in the 1H NMR. Additionally, the aromatic splitting pattern does not match the observed NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Option C, 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, best explains the NMR data. It accounts for the two methyl singlets, the aromatic proton splitting pattern, and most of the 13C NMR data. The high shift at δ 197.7 remains unresolved but is likely due to an unexpected feature of the starting material or an error.
