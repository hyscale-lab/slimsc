Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. The matrix representation of A_y is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row being (0, -i) and the second row being (i, 0).

So, the first thing I remember is that for any 2x2 matrix, finding eigenvalues involves solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A_y - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

Wait, but wait, let me get the setup right. The operator A_y is given by c times S. So I should probably compute the matrix A_y first.

Let me write down matrix S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, then A_y = c * S. And c is h/(4π). Hmm. So, substituting c into S, we get:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which would make each element of S multiplied by h/(4π). So,

A_y = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

But for the purposes of finding eigenvalues, perhaps I can factor out the c since it's a scalar multiple. Because eigenvalues for a matrix multiplied by a scalar are just the scalar multiplied by the original eigenvalues.

Wait, okay. So the matrix S has eigenvalues. Let's find S's eigenvalues first. Because if I can find the eigenvalues of S, then multiplying each by c will give the eigenvalues of A_y.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of S. The characteristic equation is det(S - λI) = 0.

S - λI = [[-λ, -i],
          [i, -λ]]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(-i) = λ² - (i*(-i)).

Wait, i times -i is -i² which is -(-1) = +1. So the determinant is λ² - 1 = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = ±1. So, the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y, which is c times S, should be c * 1 and c * (-1), that is c and -c.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but wait—wait a second. No, because S is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, so A_y's eigenvalues would be c * 1 and c * (-1). So a = ±c.

So a = ± h/(4π), right? Because c = h/(4π).

So looking at the options, let's see which ones match.

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh or ±2πh. Wait, no, that seems off. Because our eigenvalues are real numbers, I think. Because the matrix S is Hermitian, right? Because S is a Pauli matrix, which are Hermitian.

Wait, wait, the Pauli matrices are indeed Hermitian, yes. So S being Hermitian implies that A_y is also Hermitian because it's a scalar multiple times a Hermitian matrix. So the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real. So any option that suggests imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real, as I just thought. So Option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But since we just saw the eigenvalues are real, this can't be correct either. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Wait, let's think about this. For angular momentum operators, the square of the total angular momentum is J², which commutes with each component J_x, J_y, J_z. So if a state is an eigenstate of J_y, it's also an eigenstate of J², because they commute. So the eigenfunctions of A_y (if A is like J) would be eigenfunctions of A^2 as well. So the statement in C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. Wait, that can't be right. Because if J^2 commutes with J_y, then any eigenstate of J_y is also an eigenstate of J^2. However, it won't necessarily be an eigenstate of J_z. So the statement in C is correct: the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. So that would make C a correct statement.

Wait, no, wait: the statement in C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Which is correct, because if you have an eigenstate of J_y, it's also an eigenstate of J^2, but not of J_z (unless you're in a specific state that's also an eigenstate of J_z, but generally they don't commute). So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. I think this refers to the matrix representation in the basis of φ. So the eigenfunctions form a basis. Well, the eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix (since Ay is Hermitian) form an orthogonal basis, so any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So D's statement is correct. But wait, the wording is a bit tricky. D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions. So D is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. So the question is, which statements are correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, so looking back at the options, which one is correct.

But wait, let me double-check the eigenvalues. So the matrix S has eigenvalues 1 and -1. So A_y has eigenvalues c*1 and c*(-1), which is h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So these are real eigenvalues.

So looking at the options, the only option that seems correct regarding the eigenvalues is that they are real, which matches neither A nor B since those have imaginary parts. So A and B are wrong.

Now, looking at C and D. Let me reevaluate. 

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. As I thought earlier, since A^2 commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2. So that part is correct. But why can't they be eigenfunctions of Az? Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something. Wait, the commutator of angular momentum components is [Jx, Jy] = iħ Jz, and so on. So Ay and Az don't commute, so a state that's an eigenstate of Ay can't be an eigenstate of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate. But in a two-level system, perhaps it's possible? Hmm, not sure. But in general, eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct. Because if you have a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct and non-degenerate) form a basis for R² (or C², since it's a spin-½ system). So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenfunctions. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, which statement will I consider correct.

Wait, but looking back, in our case, the matrix A_y is 2x2, so it's a spin-½ system, right? The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenvectors are orthogonal, and form a basis.

So let's reevaluate the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps that's a bit ambiguous, but probably correct.

Wait, but let me think again about the options:

Looking at the actual eigenvalues, the eigenvalues are real, so any option that suggests otherwise is wrong.

So, in the options, C and D could be correct.

Wait, but let's think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Yes, because A^2 is diagonal in the same basis as Ay, since they commute. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But they're not eigenstates of Az unless they are at the same time, which they generally aren't. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the statement is a bit unclear. The "basis functions of the matrix operator" could mean that the eigenvectors form the basis for the matrix when it's diagonalized. Which is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but the problem is, the question is giving four options, and we need to choose which is correct.

So, from the options, which statements are correct.

Wait, but perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So let me go through each option again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be true because the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero.

Option B: Same issue as A, because eigenvalues are real.

Option C: Correct, as discussed.

Option D: Correct, as discussed.

Wait, but the question only allows one correct option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about D again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps it's saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis in which Ay is diagonal, which is correct. So when you diagonalize Ay, the basis is formed by its eigenvectors. So D is correct.

But then, the answer would have two correct statements, but the options are multiple-choice with only one correct answer.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option D. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have a matrix, the eigenvectors can form a basis, but perhaps this statement is more about the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So, the matrix A_y is diagonal in its own eigenbasis. So D's statement is correct.

But then, perhaps the correct answer is both C and D are correct, but that's not the case because the options are single letters.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, which statement holds?

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the question.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the eigenvalues again. What are the eigenvalues of A_y?

We have S with eigenvalues ±1. So A_y = c * S, so eigenvalues are ±c = ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, and their magnitude is h/(4π).

Looking at the options, which option mentions this?

Looking at the options, option A is about imaginary parts being ±2πh, which is wrong. Option B talks about real parts being ±1 and imaginary ±1/2, which is wrong.

So the only correct statements are C and D.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me reevaluate whether the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A².

Since A² is the square of the operator, which for spin systems is (h/(4π))^2 times (S² + ...). Wait, no, for spin-½ particles, S² (the Pauli matrices) have eigenvalues s(s+1), where s=½. So S² is (3/4) I, where I is the identity matrix. So A² would be (c²) * S² = (c²)(3/4) I.

Wait, but S is the Pauli matrix, so yes, S² is identity, but wait, S squared is [[1,0],[0,1]]?

Wait, no, wait S is a Pauli matrix, which for example σ_y is the matrix given here. So the square of σ_y is [[-1, 0], [0, -1]], because σ_y^2 = I, but wait, no: each Pauli matrix squares to identity. Because σ_y * σ_y = I. So S is σ_y, so S^2 = I.

So A_y = c * S, so A_y^2 = c^2 S^2 = c^2 I.

So A² is c² I. So for any state, A² acting on it would give c² times the state. So any state is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue c².

So the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

So in that case, the statement in C is correct.

Now, looking at option D: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which I think means that they form the basis in which Ay is diagonal. So yes, because when you diagonalize a matrix, the eigenvectors form the basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is in the form of a multiple-choice with one correct answer. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something, maybe option D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is not correct. Because the basis functions of the matrix operator would refer to the basis in which the matrix is represented. But the question says the matrix is already represented in the basis functions φ. So perhaps D is incorrect.

Wait, let me read the question again.

The question says, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix Ay is already given in terms of the eigenfunctions φ? Or is it in another basis?

Wait, no. The given matrix is in the standard basis (computational basis), perhaps. Because S is given as [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the standard representation of the Pauli Y matrix.

So the eigenvectors of Ay are the eigenfunctions, which form a basis. So the matrix is diagonal in this basis. So when you express Ay in the eigenbasis, it's diagonal. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, so option D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the wording is tricky. The matrix operator is given in a certain basis; the eigenfunctions might not be the same as the basis in which the matrix is represented.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is correct because the eigenfunctions form an orthogonal basis, and thus can serve as a basis for the matrix.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. So perhaps I should focus on the options again.

So the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), real. So options A and B are incorrect. So only C and D are possible. So which of these is correct.

Let me think about option C: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

As discussed earlier, since A^2 commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2. So the first part is correct.

But what about Az? Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are not the same. So an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az, so the second part is correct. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of Ay's matrix operator. So, the matrix operator is given in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions form another basis. So, the statement that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator would be correct, because when you diagonalize Ay, you express it in its eigenbasis. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but that's not possible because it's a multiple-choice with only one answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the options. Maybe only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D. Because in the problem statement, the matrix S is given, but the calculation would involve finding the eigenvectors, which are the basis functions for the matrix. So the correct statement is D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about each option again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenvectors form the basis, so the statement in D is correct.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the eigenvectors and see.

The matrix S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

For eigenvalue 1:

(S − I) v = 0.

So the matrix becomes [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

Which gives the equations: -v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ -i v2, v2 ].

We can choose v2 =1, so v = [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1:

(S + I) v = 0.

Which gives [[1, -i], [i, 1]].

Equation: v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvector is [ i, 1 ].

But these are eigenvectors for S. So for A_y, which is c S, the eigenvectors are the same, because c is a scalar.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ].

These are the eigenfunctions φ.

So the matrix operator A_y is given in the standard basis, but its eigenfunctions form another basis. So the statement in option D is correct: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So D is correct.

So which options are correct?

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, as discussed.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay, which is correct as well.

Hmm, but that would mean both C and D are correct, which can't be the case in a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a point. Let me recheck the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

I think that's correct, because A² is a commuting operator with Ay, so the eigenfunction is also eigenfunction of A². But it's not an eigenfunction of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator is given in the standard basis, which is not the same as the eigenbasis. So the statement in D would be correct only if the matrix is diagonal in the eigenbasis. But when you have the matrix A_y, it's given in the standard basis. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is correct, but perhaps the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Since the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because when you diagonalize the matrix, you're expressing it in terms of its eigenfunctions as a basis. So the statement in D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because it correctly states that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, but in the problem, the options are only to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option C was correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the nature of the operators.

The operator A² is the square of the angular momentum, which in this case would be (h/(4π))^2 multiplied by the spin part squared. Since S is the Pauli matrix, S² is identity, so A² would have eigenvalue (h/(4π))^2 * (3/4) * something? Or perhaps not, because for spin-½ particles, S² is ( (1/2)(1/2+1) )ħ², but in our case, the constant c is h/(4π), so perhaps the situation is different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute A².

A is the angular momentum operator, and A² would be (c S)² = c² S².

But S is the Pauli matrix, so S² is the identity matrix I. So A² = c² I.

So for any state, A² acting on it gives c² times that state. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So of the options, C and D are correct. But since the question is multiple-choice and only one option is correct, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions can't be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So the statement in C is correct.

Hmm. But then, looking again at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statements are C and D, but I can only choose one. I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because when you diagonalize a matrix, the eigenfunctions form the basis.

But I'm not certain. Given the confusion, perhaps I should go with the option that discusses the eigenvalues. Wait, but earlier I determined that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So the options that talk about that aren't present except in option A and B, which are wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Because when you diagonalize a matrix, the eigenfunctions form the new basis. So D is correct.

But earlier, I thought that option C was correct as well. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is incorrect because the matrix is already given in a certain basis, not in its eigenbasis.

Wait, the question says that the matrix operator has the form Ay = c·S, and S is given in a certain 2x2 form. So the matrix is given in the standard basis, probably the computational basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form another basis. So the statement in D would be correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix operator, but perhaps the matrix is not in that basis.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct options are C and D. But since I have to choose, perhaps the answer is option D.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to find another approach.

Another way is to look for which option is definitely correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A^2 is c² I, all states are eigenstates of A^2, so yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2x2 matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is a Pauli matrix, which is Hermitian. Its eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Option A and B:**
   - Both options suggest complex eigenvalues, which is incorrect because \( A_y \) is Hermitian and its eigenvalues must be real.
   - **Conclusion:** Both A and B are incorrect.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), as \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \) (since \( A^2 = c^2 S^2 \) and \( S^2 = I \), the identity matrix). Thus, any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Conclusion:** C is correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthogonal basis for the vector space, meaning they can serve as the basis functions for the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - However, the matrix \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, not necessarily its eigenbasis. The statement is ambiguous but generally true.
   - **Conclusion:** D is correct.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for a single correct statement, the most precise and unambiguous choice is **C**, as it directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

### Final Answer:
Answer: C
