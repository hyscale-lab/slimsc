Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. That's N proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my parallax and distance relationships, but I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So if the parallax is small, the star is far away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

Wait, right, the formula for distance in parsecs is d = 1 / plx. So if parallax plx increases, distance decreases, and vice versa. So, I think I need to express N in terms of distance instead of parallax.

Given that N ∝ 1/plx^5, and since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, N should be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me work that out. So 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So they're probably looking for the differential, like dN/dr. Because that would tell us how many stars are added as we move a small distance dr.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. Hmm, but the options don't have d^4 directly. Let me check the options again.

The options are:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Wait, so option C is r^4. But wait, what am I calculating? Oh, wait. Let me clarify. The question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So they want dN/dr, I think. Because "per unit range" implies a differential.

So if N = k * d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So the correct answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but why is it per unit distance? Let me think again. Suppose you have a region of the sky, and as you move from distance r to r + dr, how many stars are in that shell? The number density would depend on the volume, but wait, stars are 3D, so perhaps integrating over the volume.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the volume. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the surface density multiplied by the area of the shell and the thickness. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial statement is about the number of stars per unit area, as it's a specific region of the sky. So if N is the number of stars per unit area, and that's proportional to 1/plx^5, then in terms of distance, N = k * d^5. But when you look at the number of stars per unit distance in the line of sight (radial direction), like how many stars you'd encounter as you move a distance dr away, that's different.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. The question seems to state that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So if I have more stars at a certain distance, but when you consider per unit distance, how does it scale.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the number of stars per unit volume. No, that's different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the relation between N and d, not the differential. So if N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But the options don't directly have d^5 as a per unit distance. Wait, the options are about how N changes with distance, per unit range. Oh wait, no—option B is r^5, which would correspond to N ∝ r^5, which aligns with our initial substitution.

But then why would the per unit distance come into play? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Hmm, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit volume, but in this case, since it's a region of the sky, which is a 2D area, perhaps the number per unit area. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. Let's model the number of stars as a function of distance. Suppose the number of stars in a thin shell (per unit area) at distance d is N(d) = k * d^5. Now, if you want the number of stars per unit distance in the radial direction, that's the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4.

So the change in the number of stars with distance (per unit distance) scales as r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but why would the number of stars in a shell depend on d^5? That seems counterintuitive because as you go further, the volume increases, but the number of stars might not keep up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial statement is that N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So for a given area in the sky, the number of stars increases as you go further away, which seems odd because you'd expect that with more volume, each shell would have more stars, but maybe not as rapidly. But the given model is N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let's think again. Parallax plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

So for a fixed area in the sky, when distance increases, the number of stars in that area increases as d^5. So, the number of stars per unit distance (like how many more stars you have when you move a little further) would be the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dr is 5d^4, which is option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance," which implies the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance scales as \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided:
- **A) \( r^3 \)**: Incorrect, as the scaling is not cubic.
- **B) \( r^5 \)**: Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( r^4 \)**: Correct, as shown by the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( r^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the scaling is not quadratic.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance scales as \( r^4 \).
