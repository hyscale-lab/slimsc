Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. Oh wait, because the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, so if they have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Right, because Wien's displacement law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T.

Wait, but wait, the problem also mentions that the radial velocities are different. Star_1's radial velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that affects the luminosity. Radial velocity... Oh, radial velocity is about the Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength, but the peak wavelength they observed is the same. Or maybe the radial velocity is used to calculate the actual temperature, because the observed wavelength could be shifted due to motion. So, since they measured the same peak wavelength, but Star_2 is moving, we have to correct for that to find the actual temperature.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So, the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) is related to the rest wavelength (lambda_rest) by the Doppler effect. The formula is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, and if moving away, positive. But Star_1's velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. I think we're assuming that the 700 km/s is the radial velocity away, so the observed wavelength would be longer for Star_2. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, the observed lambda_max is the same for both. But since Star_2 is moving, its actual (rest) lambda_max would be different.

Wait, maybe the way to approach this is to find the actual temperatures of both stars. Because the observed lambda_max is the same, but due to Doppler shift, the rest lambda_max for each star could be different.

So, Wien's law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approx 2.898e-3 m·K). But when a star is moving, the observed lambda is shifted. Let me get the Doppler shift formula right. The formula for the Doppler effect when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive for moving away.

So Star_1 is not moving, so lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So for Star_2, lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2 / c). But the problem says lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs. Because they appear brightest at the same wavelength.

So, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2 / c).

But lambda_rest is related to temperature via T = b / lambda_rest.

So, T_1 = b / lambda_1_rest, and T_2 = b / lambda_2_rest.

But since lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2 / c), then substituting, T_1 = b / [lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2/c)].

But T_2 = b / lambda_2_rest. So substituting lambda_2_rest from T_2 into T_1's equation:

T_1 = (b) / [ (b / T_2) ) * (1 + v_2/c) ) ] 
= (b) * T_2 / [ b (1 + v_2/c) ) ]
= T_2 / (1 + v_2/c )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me correct that. Let me write it again. So, lambda_2_rest = b / T_2. So,

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2/c )

= (b / T_2) ) * (1 + v_2/c )

But T_1 = b / lambda_1_rest.

So,

T_1 = b / [ (b / T_2) (1 + v_2/c) ) ]

The b's cancel, so T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_2/c )

But wait, v_2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v_2/c. Speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s.

So v_2 = 700 km/s. So v_2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333...

So 1 + v_2/c ≈ 1.023333.

So, T_1 = T_2 / (1.023333) ≈ T_2 * 0.977.

So, T_1 is approximately 0.977 * T_2. Hmm, so Star_1 is a bit cooler than Star_2?

Wait, am I getting this right? Because if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength is longer. But since both stars appear to have the same peak wavelength, that implies that in reality, Star_2 is hotter because its rest wavelength is shorter. Because when you move away, the observed wavelength is longer, but if observed wavelength is same as Star_1, which is not moving, then Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter, which would mean higher temperature.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Doppler shift equation. Let me think again. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), for v_r positive when moving away.

So, for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2/c )

But lambda_obs for both stars is the same: lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

So, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2/c )

But lambda_1_rest is the rest wavelength of Star_1, which is related to its temperature T_1 by lambda_1_rest = b / T_1.

Similarly, lambda_2_rest = b / T_2.

So substituting,

b / T_1 = (b / T_2) * (1 + v_2 /c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T_1 = (1/T_2) * (1 + v_2/c )

So,

T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_2/c )

Which is the same as before. So T_1 is lower than T_2, since denominator is greater than 1. So Star_1 is cooler than Star_2.

Wait, but then in the problem statement, the observers see the same peak wavelength, but Star_2 is moving away. So Star_2 must be hotter so that when its wavelength is stretched, it appears the same as Star_1's rest wavelength. So Star_1 is cooler.

Okay, that makes sense now. So T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_2/c )

So, moving on. Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, for each star, L is proportional to R^2 T^4.

We can compute the ratio L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 / (1 + v_2/c )

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) * ( (T2/(1 + v_2/c ))^4 ) / ( T2^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2^2) / R2^2 ) * ( 1 / (1 + v_2/c )^4 )

= 2.25 * ( 1 / (1 + v_2/c )^4 )

We know v_2/c is approximately 0.02333, as before.

So (1 + v_2/c ) is approximately 1.02333.

We need to compute (1.02333)^4.

Let me calculate that.

First, compute ln(1.02333), which is approximately 0.02303 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + ... for small x. Alternatively, 1.02333^4 can be calculated step by step.

But maybe better to compute 1.02333^2 first, then square that.

1.02333^2 = (1 + 0.02333)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.02333 + (0.02333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.047204.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

0.02333^2 = (approx) 0.000544.

So 1 + 0.04666 = 1.04666, plus 0.000544 makes 1.047204.

So 1.02333^2 ≈ 1.0472.

Then, 1.0472^2 = (approx 1.0472 * 1.0472).

Compute:

1.0472 * 1.0472.

= (1 + 0.0472)(1 + 0.0472) = 1 + 2*0.0472 + (0.0472)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0944 + 0.00222784 ≈ 1.09662784.

But let's calculate it more accurately.

1.0472 * 1.0472:

= 1 * 1.0472 = 1.0472

plus 0.0472 * 1.0472.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 1.0472^2.

Compute 1.0472 * 1.0472.

Break it down:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0472 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 1 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 0.0472 = (approx 0.00222784).

Adding these together:

1 + 0.0472 + 0.0472 + 0.00222784 = 1 + 0.0944 + 0.00222784 = 1.09662784.

So approximately 1.0966. So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So, going back to the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.0966.

Hmm, let's see. 1.0966 × 2 is 2.1932. 2.25 is a bit higher. 2.25 /1.0966 ≈ 2.05? Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.0966 × 2.05 = ?

1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932.

1.0966 * 0.05 = 0.05483.

So 2.1932 + 0.05483 = 2.24803.

Which is very close to 2.25. So 2.05 × 1.0966 ≈ 2.248, which is 2.25. So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2.25 divided by 1.0966. Let me compute that.

Another approach: 1.0966 × 2 = 2.1932.

2.25 - 2.1932 = 0.0568.

So how much more than 2 do we need?

0.0568 / 1.0966 ≈ 0.0518.

So approximately 2.0518.

So L1/L2 is about 2.05. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Wait, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the problem says that the luminosity is computed by astronomers as being greater for Star_1 by a factor. So the ratio is L1/L2.

Wait, but in our calculation, L1 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4) * L2.

Wait, actually, wait the formula is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4. So L1 = 4 pi (R1)^2 sigma T1^4.

Similarly, L2 = 4 pi (R2)^2 sigma T2^4.

So the ratio is (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = [ T2/(1 + v_2/c) ] / T2 = 1/(1 + v_2/c )

Which is approximately 1/1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So, (0.977)^4 is roughly?

Compute 0.977^2 first.

0.977 * 0.977 = ?

Well, 0.977^2 = (1 - 0.023)^2 = 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 ≈ 0.9545.

Wait, more accurately:

0.977 × 0.977 = ?

977 × 977: Let's compute 977 × 977.

= (1000 - 23) × (1000 - 23) = 1000000 - 2×1000×23 + 23^2 = 1e6 - 46,000 + 529 = 954,529.

But since 0.977 is 977/1000, so (0.977)^2 = 0.954529.

So (0.977)^4 = (0.954529)^2.

Compute 0.954529^2: let's approximate.

0.95^2 is 0.9025.

0.004529^2 is negligible, but cross terms: (0.95 + 0.004529)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.004529 + (0.004529)^2 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.008594 ≈ 0.911094.

Wait, but more accurately, 0.954529 × 0.954529.

Compute 0.9545 × 0.9545.

Approximating:

= (0.95 + 0.0045) × (0.95 + 0.0045) = 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.0045 + 0.0045².

0.95² = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.0045 = 2 * 0.004275 = 0.00855.

0.0045² = 0.00002025.

Adding: 0.9025 + 0.00855 = 0.91105, plus 0.00002025 gives 0.91107025.

So approximately 0.91107.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = 0.91107.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.25 * 0.911.

Compute 2.25 * 0.911.

2 * 0.911 = 1.822.

0.25 * 0.911 = 0.22775.

Sum: 1.822 + 0.22775 = 2.04975.

So approximately 2.05.

But wait, the options are all higher than that. The options are around 2.23 or higher. So am I missing something here?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the temperature ratio. Let me re-express T_1 and T_2.

Wait, when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. So lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r/c).

But for Star_1, v_r is 0, so lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.

For Star_2, lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2/c).

Since they have the same observed peak wavelength, lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

So,

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_2/c).

But,

lambda_1_rest = b / T_1.

lambda_2_rest = b / T_2.

So,

b / T_1 = (b / T_2) * (1 + v_2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T_1 = (1/T_2) * (1 + v_2/c )

So,

T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_2/c )

Which makes T_1 less than T_2. So T_1 is lower than T_2.

So, when you substitute into the luminosity formula, you get:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

T1/T2 is 1/(1 + v_2/c ) = 1/1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So T1/T2 ≈ 0.977.

So, (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.911 as before.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.049.

But the options are all higher than that. Hmm. So something's wrong here.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the Doppler shift formula. Let me double-check.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * ( (c + v_observer) / (c + v_source) ) ), but in this case, we're considering the source moving away, so v_source is positive.

Wait, no: the standard formula when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_source/c ), assuming v_source is positive when moving away and much less than c.

Wait, but more accurately, the Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

where v_r is the radial velocity (positive when moving away).

So, in Star_2's case, v_r is +700 km/s.

So, lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + 700/3e5 )

= lambda_2_rest * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 * lambda_2_rest.

But lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.

And since lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs, 

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * 1.002333.

Now, lambda_1_rest = b / T_1.

lambda_2_rest = b / T_2.

So,

b / T_1 = (b / T_2) * 1.002333.

Divide both sides by b:

1 / T_1 = (1 / T_2) * 1.002333.

So,

T_1 = T_2 / 1.002333 ≈ T_2 * 0.997678.

So, T_1 is approximately 0.997678 * T_2.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of v_2/c. Let me recalculate.

v_2 = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.00233333...

So, 1 + v_2/c = 1.00233333...

So, T_1 = T_2 / 1.00233333...

Which is approximately T_2 * (1 - 0.002329), using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So, T_1 ≈ T_2 * 0.99767.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767^4.

First, compute 0.99767^2.

0.99767 * 0.99767.

Let me compute it as (1 - x)^2 where x=0.00233.

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x².

x=0.00233, so 2x=0.00466, x²≈5.4289e-6.

So, 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 0.995345.

Now, compute (0.995345)^2.

Again, using (1 - y)^2, where y=0.004655.

y=0.004655,

y^2≈ (0.004655)^2≈ 2.167e-5.

So,

1 - 2y + y^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00931 + 0.00002167 ≈ 0.99071167.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So now, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907.

1.5^2 = 2.25.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Oh, wait, that's approximately 2.228, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So the answer should be D.

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Because earlier I used a larger v_2/c, which gave a larger denominator, but now with the correct v_2/c, the ratio is about 2.23.

So the correct answer is D, approximately 2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 \cdot R_2 \). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
From Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

The observed peak wavelengths for both stars are the same, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), while Star_1 is stationary (\( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)). Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)
\]

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{2,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars (\( \lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} \)):

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{rest}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Dividing through by \( b \) and rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}
\]

The speed of light \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009332 = 0.99067
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

**Answer: D**
