Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

The problem is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm. Let's read it again.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first thing, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities require the state to be a unit vector. Right, normalization is important here.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they form an orthonormal basis. That means the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero, and each has a norm of 1.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me write this as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i). But because it's proportional, I need to find the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So, the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let's compute that.

Calculating |a|^2: a = (1+i), so |a|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, more accurately, |a|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2? Wait, no, no. Wait, the modulus squared of a complex number z = x + iy is x² + y². So for a = (1 + i), |a|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly for b = (2 - i), |b|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So |a|² + |b|² = 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation is A with elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. So, for a 2x2 matrix, it looks like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

So, that's a 2x2 matrix. This operator must be Hermitian because it's an observable, right? Let me check if this matrix is Hermitian. The elements are real, so the matrix is symmetric, so yes, it's Hermitian. So its eigenvalues are real.

The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates we need to find the probabilities for. Because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared norms of the projections onto the corresponding eigenstates.

So, first, I need to find the eigenstates of A. Let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

The matrix is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So,

| (-λ)   (ħ/2) |
| (ħ/2)  (-λ) |

Determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = (ħ²/4), which implies λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

So,

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1]   [0]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [v2] = [0]

Equation 1: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So, the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1,1). But since we can choose normalization, let's take |eigen+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Because when you have v1 = v2 = 1/sqrt(2), then the norm is (1/sqrt(2))² + (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2 +1/2=1.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvector for λ= ħ/2 is any non-zero vector, but in our case, the equations give v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is (1,1), but normalized. So it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

(A + λ I) v = 0.

[ (ħ/2)   (ħ/2) ] [v1]   [0]
[ (ħ/2)  (ħ/2) ] [v2] = [0]

Equation: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1), normalized to (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the eigenstates are |eigen+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |eigen-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, we need to find the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate. So, the state is |alpha>, and when we express it in terms of the eigenstates of A, the coefficients squared give the probabilities.

Wait, but wait. |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (|up> and |down>), and the eigenstates of A are expressed in the same z-basis. So, to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, we can compute the inner products.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates |eigen+> and |eigen-> are known, we can find the components of |alpha> in each.

So, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue λ is |<eigen|alpha>|^2.

So, let's compute <eigen+|alpha> and <eigen-|alpha>.

First, write |alpha> as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in the eigenbasis:

|eigen+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).
|eigen-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's compute <eigen+|alpha>.

<eigen+|alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ) + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ) ].

But <up|down> is zero, and <up|up> = <down|down> =1.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)*1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

1 + 2 =3; i -i is zero. So 3.

So, <eigen+|alpha> = (3)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9)/(14).

Similarly, compute <eigen-|alpha>.

<eigen-|alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)* <down|up> ) - (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ) ]

Again, <up|down> is zero.

So, simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7)*1 + 0 -0 - (2 -i)/sqrt(7)*1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Inside the brackets: 1 -2 = -1; i +i = 2i.

So, (-1 + 2i).

So, <eigen-|alpha> = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2.

Compute the modulus squared: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation. The modulus squared of (a + ib) is a² + b². So, (-1 + 2i) has a modulus squared of 1 +4=5. So 5/14 is the probability for eigen-.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which makes sense because the probabilities should sum to 1.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let's compute 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. And 5/14 ≈0.357, about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36 and average hbar/7.

Wait, but before getting to the average value, let's compute that.

The average value of the operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, and A has matrix elements given, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

But I think another approach is to use the spectral decomposition. The average value is sum_{eigen} (eigenvalue) * probability.

So, the average value would be (ħ/2) * (9/14) + (-ħ/2) * (5/14) = [ (9/14) - (5/14) ) ] * (ħ/2).

Which is (4/14) * (ħ/2) ) = (2/7) * (ħ/2) ) = ħ/(7).

So the average is ħ/7.

So, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

Wait, let me check. Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's what I have.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, I could compute the expectation value using the matrix.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute this as:

(1/sqrt(7))(1 - i)  [ (0)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it in matrix terms.

Wait, more accurately, the expectation value is [alpha]* A [alpha], where alpha is the vector.

The vector alpha is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

So, compute A multiplied by alpha.

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

So, A * alpha = [ (0) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ), ( (ħ/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + 0 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ( ( (2 -i) * ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ), ( ( (1+i) * ħ/2 ) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Then, the conjugate of alpha is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, the expectation value is the conjugate of alpha multiplied by A alpha.

So,

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * [ ( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7), ( (1+i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Dot product:

(1 - i)(2 - i) ( ħ/2 ) / (7) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ( ħ/2 ) / (7 )

Compute each term.

First term:

(1 - i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i². i² is -1.

So, 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term:

(2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i² → 2 +2i +i -1 → (2-1) + (3i) → 1 +3i.

So, putting it together:

[ (1-3i) + (1 +3i) ] * ( ħ/2 ) /7.

Simplify numerator: (1-3i +1 +3i ) = 2.

So, (2) * ( ħ/2 ) /7 → ( ħ ) /7.

Which matches what I found earlier.

So, yes, the average value is ħ/7.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and average ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Yes, that's what I have.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of a given operator and finding the average value of that operator. The state of the electron is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\downarrow}\rangle,
\]

where \(|{\uparrow}\rangle\) and \(|{\downarrow}\rangle\) are the eigenstates of the \(z\)-projection of the spin operator. The operator in question has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of \(A\)
The eigenvalues of \(A\) are found by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|{\text{eigen}+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle\right), \quad |{\text{eigen}-}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle\right).
\]

### Step 2: Probabilities of Measuring Each Eigenstate
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|{\text{eigen}+}\rangle\) and \(|{\text{eigen}-}\rangle\) are given by \(|\langle{\text{eigen}+}|\alpha\rangle|^2\) and \(|\langle{\text{eigen}-}|\alpha\rangle|^2\), respectively.

#### For \(|{\text{eigen}+}\rangle\):
\[
\langle{\text{eigen}+}|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\langle{\uparrow}|\alpha\rangle + \langle{\downarrow}|\alpha\rangle\right].
\]
Substituting \(|\alpha\rangle\):
\[
\langle{\text{eigen}+}|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}\right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
|\langle{\text{eigen}+}|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

#### For \(|{\text{eigen}-}\rangle\):
\[
\langle{\text{eigen}-}|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\langle{\uparrow}|\alpha\rangle - \langle{\downarrow}|\alpha\rangle\right].
\]
Substituting \(|\alpha\rangle\):
\[
\langle{\text{eigen}-}|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}\right] = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
|\langle{\text{eigen}-}|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 3: Average Value of \(A\)
The average value of \(A\) is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle\alpha|A|\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the eigenstate probabilities and eigenvalues:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\cdot\frac{9}{14} + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\cdot\frac{5}{14} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), and the average value of \(A\) is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
