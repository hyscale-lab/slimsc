Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which I remember is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, so we're definitely dealing with relativistic effects here.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is related to the amplitude and the spring constant. Oh right, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), right? But since this is relativistic, I need to consider how relativity affects the equation.

Relativity usually comes into play when speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light. So the kinetic energy can't be just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, we should use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved, so the total energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) should be all potential energy, and at the equilibrium point, it's all kinetic energy. So in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at the equilibrium would be (1/2)mv_max², which gives v_max as sqrt(kA²/m). But with relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc² at maximum speed, when all potential energy is converted into kinetic.

Wait, but wait, the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might be different. Or does the potential energy still follow the same form, U = (1/2)kx²? I think for the purpose of this problem, they're assuming that the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So let's model this. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic. At the maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential.

The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, E = (1/2)kA².

At equilibrium, E = (γ - 1) mc², since that's the relativistic kinetic energy.

Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc².

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But in the relativistic case, we have (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc², and γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Hmm, so we can write:

(1/2)kA² = ( (1/(sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²))) - 1 ) * mc².

I need to solve for v_max.

Let me rearrange the equation.

Let me denote v = v_max for simplicity.

So,

(1/2)kA² = ( (1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) * mc².

Let me divide both sides by mc² to simplify:

( (1/2)kA² ) / (mc²) ) = (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) - 1.

Let me let’s call the left side a constant. Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as some term, say, let’s call it Q. So Q = (kA²)/(2mc²).

Then, the equation becomes:

Q = [1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))] - 1.

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = Q + 1.

Taking reciprocal of both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(Q + 1).

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(Q + 1)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(Q + 1)^2.

So,

v^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(Q + 1)^2 ].

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(Q+1)^2.

Let me compute (Q + 1)^2 = Q^2 + 2Q + 1.

So, 1/(Q+1)^2 = 1/(Q^2 + 2Q +1).

So,

1 - 1/(Q+1)^2 = ( (Q^2 + 2Q +1) - 1 ) / (Q^2 + 2Q +1 )

= (Q^2 + 2Q ) / (Q^2 + 2Q +1 )

= Q (Q + 2 ) / ( (Q + 1)^2 )

Hmm, but perhaps I should compute 1 - 1/(Q+1)^2 differently.

Wait, 1 - (1/(Q+1)^2) = [ (Q+1)^2 - 1 ] / (Q+1)^2.

Compute numerator: (Q+1)^2 -1 = Q² + 2Q +1 - 1 = Q² + 2Q.

So,

v^2 = c^2 ( (Q² + 2Q) ) / ( (Q +1)^2 )

So,

v = c sqrt( (Q² +2Q) ) / ( (Q +1) )

We can factor Q^2 + 2Q as Q(Q + 2).

So,

v = c sqrt( Q(Q + 2) ) / (Q +1 )

Hmm, but let's let Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²), as before.

Substituting back,

v = c * sqrt( [ (kA²/(2 m c²)) * (kA²/(2 m c²) + 2) ] ) / ( (kA²/(2m c²) ) + 1 )

Wait, perhaps we can factor the numerator inside the square root.

Wait,

sqrt( Q (Q + 2) ) / (Q + 1 )

= sqrt( [ Q (Q + 2) ] ) / (Q +1 )

= sqrt( [ Q (Q + 2) ] ) / (Q +1 )

Hmm, perhaps we can write it as sqrt( [ Q^2 + 2Q ] ) / (Q +1 )

Which is sqrt( [ (Q +1)^2 - 1 ] ) / (Q +1 )

Because (Q +1)^2 is Q² + 2Q +1. So subtract 1 from that and you get Q² + 2Q.

So,

sqrt( (Q +1)^2 - 1 ) / (Q +1 )

= sqrt( ( (Q +1)^2 - 1 ) ) / (Q +1 )

= sqrt( ( (Q +1) - 1 ) ( (Q +1) + 1 ) ) / (Q +1 )

Wait, that's sqrt( ( Q ) ( Q + 2 ) ), which brings us back. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator:

Q^2 + 2Q = Q (Q + 2 )

So,

sqrt( Q (Q + 2 ) ) / (Q + 1 )

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as sqrt( [ (Q +1)^2 -1 ] ) / (Q +1 )

Which is sqrt( (Q+1)^2 - 1 ) / (Q +1 )

= sqrt( [ (Q+1)^2 (1 - 1/(Q+1)^2) ] ) / (Q+1 )

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, we can express the entire expression as sqrt( (Q (Q + 2 )) ) / (Q +1 )

Which is, sqrt(Q (Q +2 )) / (Q +1 )

Maybe factor out a Q from the numerator inside the square root.

Wait,

sqrt( Q (Q + 2) ) = sqrt( Q^2 + 2Q )

= Q * sqrt(1 + 2/(Q) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rationalize or find an expression that matches one of the options.

Let me look at the options given.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 )

Wait, but that denominator inside the denominator would be (1 - (kA²)/(2m) )

Wait, but in our case, Q = (kA²)/(2 m c² ). So (kA²)/(2m) is (Q c²)/1.

So (1 - (kA²)/(2 m) ) = 1 - ( Q c^2 )

Wait, not sure.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

But 1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² ) is 1 - Q.

So 1/(1 - Q) is 1/(1 - Q), so 1 + 1/(1 - Q )= [ (1 - Q ) + 1 ] / (1 - Q ) ) = (2 - Q )/(1 - Q )

Hmm, but not quite matching.

Option C is v_max = sqrt(k A² / m ), which is the non-relativistic case, but that's not correct in the relativistic scenario.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, let's see. Let me compute 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ) = 1 + Q.

So 1/(1 + Q )^2.

So 1 - [1/(1+Q)^2 ].

Hmm, in our expression for v^2, we have:

v^2 = c^2 * ( Q^2 + 2 Q )/( (Q +1 )^2 )

Which is c^2 * Q (Q + 2 )/( (Q +1 )^2 )

Wait, let me compute (Q^2 + 2 Q ) = Q (Q + 2 )

Hmm, perhaps I should express this as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ Q (Q +2 ) ] / ( Q +1 )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( Q (Q +2 ) ) / ( Q +1 )

Hmm, but none of the options seem to directly match that. So maybe I'm missing a step here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the setup.

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is (1/2) k A^2. At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, which is (γ - 1)mc². So,

(1/2) k A^2 = (γ -1 ) mc².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

= 1 + Q,

since Q is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

γ = 1 + Q.

But γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c² ), so,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + Q.

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + Q )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + Q )^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2.

Which is,

v² = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ]

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 )

Wait, this looks different from my earlier approach. Oh wait, earlier I might have messed up the steps. Let me see.

Wait, in this approach, I end up with v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ), where Q is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches option D.

Because option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

So that would be the correct answer. So the maximum speed is given by option D.

Alternatively, let's compute our expression.

1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2.

Let me compute that.

1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 = [ (1+Q)^2 -1 ] / (1 + Q )^2.

(1+Q)^2 = 1 + 2Q + Q².

So,

[1 + 2Q + Q² -1 ] = 2Q + Q² = Q(2 + Q )

So,

1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 = [ Q(2 + Q) ] / (1+Q )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ Q(2 + Q ) ] / (1+Q )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( Q(2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

Hmm, but wait, in this case, what is Q? Q = k A²/(2 m c² )

So,

Q(2 + Q ) = [k A²/(2 m c² ) ] * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ]

= [ k A²/(2 m c² ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c² ) ]

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

But back to the options, the expression I derived is option D. So looking at the options, option D is:

D) v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I have. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we start by considering the conservation of energy. The total mechanical energy \( E \) is conserved, and at the maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, which in the relativistic case is \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the potential energy at maximum displacement to the kinetic energy at equilibrium:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly manipulate the denominator and do not match the derived expression.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D** correctly incorporates the relativistic correction to the maximum speed.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
