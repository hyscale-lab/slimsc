Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H or N-H stretch. But since the options are mostly about benzoic acids and benzene derivatives, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because the broad peak around 3400 could come from an -OH group. The 1720 cm-1 peak is around where a carbonyl (C=O) would show up, like in a carboxylic acid or an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be aromatic C=C stretches, suggesting a benzene ring.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet at around 10 ppm is typical for an aliphatic -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. So that's a hint that the compound has a carboxylic acid group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are doublets, likely from aromatic protons. If they're doublets, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the structure is like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm could be a CH near some electronegative group. Maybe part of a CH2CH2 group or adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe some CH2 groups, like adjacent to a carbonyl or part of an ethyl chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet at around 1.4 ppm is typical for a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH2 that's next to another group. Like a branching point.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet at 0.9 suggests a terminal CH3, probably at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together: The NMR suggests a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and some branching in the alkyl chain attached to the ring. Let's think about the substituent. If the benzene is para-substituted, then the substituents are on opposite positions. One substituent is the carboxylic acid (from the IR and NMR), and the other is an alkyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, that would be a benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid at position 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be off. Alternatively, maybe it's the benzene ring with substituents at positions 4 and 1? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituents in the benzene ring: let's think about the NMR. The aromatic protons are as a doublet at 8.0 and another doublet at 7.2. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with two substituents (like a di-substituted ring), such as a para-dimethyl group and a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain. Let me think about the structure. The carboxylic acid is attached to a benzene ring, and there's an alkyl chain connected to the ring. Let's try to reconstruct.

The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH3 connected to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to a CH that's branching. So maybe a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the possible substituent. Let's say the benzene ring has a substituent that's a -CH2-CO2H group, but that's just me guessing. Or perhaps it's an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is likely a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

So in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is the -OH proton. The aromatic protons are two doublets, which in a para-disubstituted benzene would make sense. So if the substituents are on para positions, each set of aromatic protons would be a doublet.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propiono group attached to the benzene. So the structure could be benzene with a CH2CH2COOH group. But the NMR data has a CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H), which is maybe a CH2 connected to something.

Wait, let me consider the possible structure. The NMR shows:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, which suggests para substitution.

- The 10.5 ppm is the -OH of a carboxylic acid.

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps in a CH2CH2COOH chain. Wait, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group connected to the benzene and then another CH2 or CH group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a propyl group that's branched. Let's think about the substituent as a (CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group. Because the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to a CH, which is connected to another CH2.

Wait, an iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait that would have two CH2 groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me try to figure that out.

Wait, the substituent would have a branching. So let me think of the substituent as -(CH2)n-COOH, but the NMR shows a -CH2-CH- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: the substituent on the benzene ring could be a chain with a branching point. Let's imagine the benzene ring has a substituent that's a propionyl group, but that's not matching the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's see. Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to the benzene. The substituent in the para position would be a sec-butyl group.

So, the benzene would be 4-substituted with a sec-butyl group and 1-substituted with the COOH group? Or maybe the COOH is at position 1 and the substituent is at position 4.

Wait, the substituents would be in the para positions. So if the benzene has COOH at position 1, the substituent would be at position 4.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. What's a sec-butyl group? It's -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me draw that.

So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let's see if that matches the NMR.

The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That would be the CH group in the sec-butyl. The CH would have two neighboring groups: CH2 and another CH2CH3. The splitting could be a multiplet.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): These might be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. One is next to the benzene (CH2 connected to benzene) and the other is connected to the CH and then the CH2CH3.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): This would be the CH3 group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): The triplet comes from the CH2CH3 group at the end.

So that seems to fit. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, meaning the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would correspond to option C.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Yes. So that's our compound X.

Now, the next part is the reaction. Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do?

Red phosphorus and HI (a HI with PPh3 maybe? Or just P and HI?) is typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for elimination. Wait, more accurately, red phosphorus with HI is used for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or for the hydrolysis of nitriles. Wait, no, wait: when a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amide, which can then be further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But wait, in this case, our compound is a carboxylic acid already. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, another reaction: when a ketone is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes the Clemmensen reduction, converting the ketone to an alkane. But wait, in this case, our compound has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group. Maybe the reaction involves the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, considering the substituent. Since X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination reaction.

Wait, wait. Maybe it's a reaction that involves the benzylic position. Benzylic protons are acidic, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is a Lewis acid. HI is a strong acid. Another possibility is that the carboxylic acid group is being transformed.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the COOH group is being converted to an acid chloride, but I don't think so because HI isn't a typical chlorinating agent without something else.

Wait, another possibility: when a carboxylic acid is treated with a strong reducing agent. Wait, but red phosphorus with HI isn't a common reductant for carboxylic acids. Maybe it's about elimination.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an alkyl group that can undergo some elimination. Let me think: if the substituent is a secondary or tertiary alkyl group, maybe it can undergo dehydrohalogenation or some elimination.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, they can be used to dehydrate certain compounds. Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration of an alcohol, but in this case, the compound is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -OH group is replaced by something else. Wait, but in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the -COOH is protonated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But where would the leaving group be?

Wait, another angle: the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. So the structure is:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and -CH2CH(CH2CH3) at position 4.

When treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the secondary or tertiary carbon adjacent to the ring (the CH in the sec-butyl group) could undergo some reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the elimination of HX to form an alkene. But in that case, the substituent would lose a hydrogen and the neighboring group would form a double bond.

Wait, but to form an alkene, you typically need a β-hydrogen. The CH in the sec-butyl group has two CH2 groups attached. Let me visualize the structure:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

If the CH group (the one in the middle) is attached to the benzene, and the adjacent CH2 is connected to another CH2CH3.

Wait, so perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but where is the halogen?

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the CH group is replaced by something else. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group in the benzoic acid. But red phosphorus and HI don't typically reduce carboxylic acids, unless under specific conditions. Wait, maybe it's converting the carboxylic acid to an acid chloride? But that usually requires something like SOCl2 or PCl5.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the carboxylic acid to an alcohol via some mechanism. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -O- group. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid reacts with HI, perhaps it can form an acid chloride, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. But the -COOH is not very reactive towards nucleophiles.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options for the product are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the question says that compound X is the starting material, and after reacting with red phosphorus and HI, we get the product. So looking at the options, options B and D are just benzene derivatives without the carboxylic acid group.

So if X is a benzoic acid, the reaction would have to remove the COOH group or transform it.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings, typically under different conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted into something else. Let's think about a possible elimination.

Wait, perhaps compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When treated with HI and red phosphorus, maybe the benzylic position (the CH in the sec-butyl) could undergo some substitution or elimination.

Wait, but I'm not recalling a specific reaction where a benzylic position reacts with HI and red phosphorus. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, which is similar but not the same.

Wait, another thought: maybe the acid is being converted into an acid chloride, but I don't think HI is a good reagent for that. Then, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the chloride replaces the oxygen, but that would require a good leaving group, which the carboxylic acid isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the carboxylic acid to form an acid anhydride, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl. But again, without activating the carbonyl, it's unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about each option.

Option C is the same as compound X, so that's not the product. So the product must be one of A, B, D.

Wait, but the reaction is between X and red phosphorus and HI. Let me think about the structure of X again, which is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent on the benzene is being modified. For example, the -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group could undergo some change.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible reactions of a benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, or perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methylene group. But I don't recall such a reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it is converted into an acid bromide or chloride. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a halogen. But that would require a good leaving group. But in this case, the OH is in the carboxylic acid, which is a poor leaving group unless activated.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is converted into a -CH2OH group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of CO2, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the substituent again.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So when X reacts, perhaps the substituent undergoes a substitution or elimination.

Wait, when an alkyl group attached to a benzene ring is treated with HI, perhaps a benzylic substitution occurs. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, the benzylic position (the CH2 next to the benzene) might undergo an SN1 or SN2 substitution. But in the sec-butyl group, the CH is attached to two CH2 groups, so it's a secondary carbon. For an SN2 reaction, a secondary center is possible but less favored than primary.

Alternatively, maybe the compound undergoes elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, in the presence of HI, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation occurs. Wait, but where's the halogen? Or maybe the reaction adds HI to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary carbon (like in isobutyl), but in the case of sec-butyl, it's secondary.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring substitution, but I don't think so. The substituent is on the benzene, and the reaction is more likely to affect the substituent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. But in that case, the product would have a Cl instead of OH. But looking at the options, none of the options have a Cl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI do that. Usually, LiAlH4 or other strong reducing agents are used for that.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong reaction. Let me think about the possibility that X is a nitrile, but no, the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is more in line with a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. But without activation, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the benzene ring. But that would require a catalyst like Fe and HCl, and I don't think red phosphorus and HI do that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in identifying the reagents. Red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But in this case, the starting material is already a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -O- group. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a Grignard-like reaction, but without Mg, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. But I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an aldehyde. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2 with the formation of a benzyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options after reaction are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (same as starting material)

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So the product is either a benzene with substituents that include an isobutyl and methyl, or a propanoic acid derivative.

Wait, if the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group, and the reaction converts the benzylic CH into a CH2, perhaps via a substitution or elimination.

Wait, if the CH in the sec-butyl group is replaced by a CH2, then the substituent becomes an isobutyl group. Because a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), so replacing the CH with a CH2 would make it CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes a reduction, converting the CH into a CH2. If the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3), and the CH is reduced to a CH2, then the substituent becomes CH2CH2CH2CH3, which is a pentyl group? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent loses a carbon. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but where is the halogen coming from? Maybe the reaction adds HI to the substituent, then eliminates H2O or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction adds HI to form a double bond.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That suggests a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4. The substituent at position 1 is a sec-butyl group, and at position 4 is a methyl group. But that doesn't match with the starting material's NMR, which had a substituent that is a sec-butyl group. Wait, no, the starting material would have two substituents?

Wait, no, the starting material would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. So after reaction, perhaps the COOH is converted into something else, and the substituent becomes a methyl group.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group and forms a methyl group.

Wait, but how? If the COOH group is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4, then after reaction, perhaps the COOH is replaced by a methyl group, leading to a dimethyl benzene. But that would require some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation, but that's unrelated.

Wait, another thought: maybe the carboxylic acid is being decarboxylated to form a benzyl group. So, the COOH becomes a CH2 group. If so, the substituent would change from COOH to CH3, but that depends on the conditions.

Wait, in the presence of certain reducing agents, a carboxylic acid can be reduced to a methylene group. For example, using LiAlH4 in certain conditions can reduce a carboxylic acid to a CH2 group. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI, which I'm not sure can do that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. But again, I don't think red phosphorus and HI can do that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride, which could then undergo elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl chloride. But that would require a good leaving group, which the carboxylic acid isn't.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups, which the COOH is, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a -CH2Cl group, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but X is already a carboxylic acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the reaction is not about the substituent but the carboxylic acid.

Wait, another idea: if the carboxylic acid is converted into a methyl group, then the product would be a toluene derivative. But I'm not sure how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the -COOH group with a methyl group, but I don't know the mechanism.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid, leading to the formation of a gem-diol, which then eliminates water to form an alkene. But I'm not sure if that's possible with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid anhydride, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the -COOH into a ketone. But I don't know how that would occur.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible structures of the options.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the benzene has a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. But in the starting material, X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl at position 4. So if the reaction reduces the COOH group to a methyl group and leaves the substituent, then the product would have methyl at position 1 and the substituent at position 4. Wait, but the substituent in X is at position 4, so if the COOH at 1 is converted to a methyl, then the product would have a methyl at 1 and the substituent at 4. But in option D, the substituent is at 1, and the methyl at 4. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into a methyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a branching point. Let me think about the structure of X: the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, which is in the para position relative to the COOH group.

So if the reaction converts the sec-butyl substituent into an ethyl group, perhaps via a reduction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes a reaction that removes a part of it. For example, elimination of H2O could form a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, upon treatment with HI, perhaps the CH group is replaced by a CH2, making it an isobutyl group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: if the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen in the COOH is replaced by a Cl or something else, but I don't see how that would fit the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, it could lose a water molecule to form a double bond, becoming a vinyl group. But that would require a suitable structure.

Wait, but the substituent is a sec-butyl, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). To form a double bond, perhaps the CH becomes a double bond to the adjacent CH2. So, the substituent would become CH2C=CHCH2CH3? That seems unlikely without a good leaving group.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the reaction part. Maybe I should think about what each option represents.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So the benzene has isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4. That would require two substituents, but in X, there's only a COOH and a substituent. So perhaps the reaction adds a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into an isobutyl group. Wait, the substituent in X is a sec-butyl group. If that becomes an isobutyl group, perhaps via a substitution.

Wait, the substituent is currently -CH2CH(CH2CH3). If it becomes -CH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutyl), that would require a change. Maybe the reaction leads to the substitution of the CH2 group with a CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydride shift or some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the substituent. Let's say the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which could be reduced to a butyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the CH in the substituent is replaced by a CH2 group, converting the substituent into a tertiary butyl group. But that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: when a secondary alcohol is treated with HI, it can undergo substitution to form an alkyl iodide. But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Wait, unless the substituent has an -OH group, which I don't think it does.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a methyl group. If that's the case, the product would have a methyl group where the COOH was. So the substituent would remain a sec-butyl, and the COOH becomes CH3, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But looking at the options, that's not one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH into a CH2I group. But again, that would require a substitution which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the product options:

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene has substituents at positions 1 and 4. The substituent at 1 is isobutyl, and at 4 is methyl.

But our starting material, X, has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. So, perhaps the reaction replaces the COOH with a methyl group and keeps the substituent as isobutyl.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would have changed from sec-butyl to isobutyl. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the substituent, converting a sec-butyl to isobutyl. But I'm not sure under what conditions that would occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent remains the same, and the COOH is replaced by a methyl group.

Wait, if the COOH is at position 1, and after reaction, it becomes a methyl group, then the product would have a methyl at 1 and the substituent at 4 would be the same as before. So, the substituent was a sec-butyl, so the product would have a methyl at 1 and a sec-butyl at 4. That would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the substituent at position 1 is a sec-butyl, and position 4 is methyl. How does that happen?

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then after reaction, the COOH at position 1 is replaced by a methyl group, and the substituent at position 4 becomes a methyl group as well. That doesn't make sense unless there's some other change.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent is converted into a methyl group. But that would require removing two carbons, which seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent is part of a larger group that undergoes a reaction, such as loss of a carbon. For example, decarboxylation could occur, converting the COOH into a methyl group. But I'm not sure about the conditions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the entire problem again.

Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

What does this reagent do?

Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But X is already a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction is not about that.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the substituent is changed. Another possibility is that the reaction causes the substituent to undergo an elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, considering the substituent, CH2CH(CH2CH3), maybe elimination occurs to form CH2CH2CH2CH3. But I don't think that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the substituent. For example, a ketone to an alcohol, but the substituent isn't a ketone.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's CH is replaced by a CH2 group, making it an isobutyl group. That would change the substituent from sec-butyl to isobutyl.

If that's the case, then the product would have an isobutyl group at position 4 and a methyl group (from COOH) at position 1. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into a methyl group. But that would require losing two carbons, which I don't think is feasible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is simply removed, leaving the benzene with a methyl group. But that seems unlikely without a good leaving group.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about what each option's structure looks like.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Position 1 has a sec-butyl group, and position 4 has a methyl group.

Wait, but in the starting material, X, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So, after reaction, how would substituents end up at positions 1 and 4 as sec-butyl and methyl, respectively?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about substitution but about forming a new substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but without Mg, that's not applicable.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by a methyl group, and the substituent remains as sec-butyl. That would give 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option C if the substituent is at position 4. But option C is the starting material, so that's not the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into a methyl group, and the COOH becomes something else.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the presence of alcohols to form alkyl phosphates, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the benzylic position. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the CH is benzylic. Maybe HI acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzylic carbon, leading to some substitution.

But for an SN2 reaction, the carbon needs to be primary. The benzylic carbon in the sec-butyl group is secondary, which is less likely for SN2. Maybe it's possible, but I'm not certain.

If the CH in the substituent is replaced by an HI, perhaps the product would have a CH2I group. But that would require a substitution, and I don't think that's one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction where the substituent is extended. But I don't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the conversion of the substituent into an ethyl group. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the substituent. But that would leave the COOH as the only substituent, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess here.

Looking back at the options, the only one that makes sense after a reaction that would remove the COOH group is option B or D, which are benzene derivatives without the COOH.

So perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into a methyl group, and the substituent remains as isobutyl or something else.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would change. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH to a methyl group, and the substituent remains as is.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a methyl group, and the substituent at position 4 becomes a methyl as well. But that doesn't fit any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent remains as is, and the COOH is replaced by a methyl group, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is converted into a methyl group. For example, if the substituent (sec-butyl) loses two carbons, becoming a methyl. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into an ethyl group.

Wait, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to make a guess based on the NMR and the reaction.

Given that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction converts it into one of the options, and the options B and D are without the COOH group, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group.

Wait, if the COOH is reduced to a CH2CH3 group, perhaps via a reaction that adds HI, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH into a CH2 group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. Again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the substituent. If the substituent is a sec-butyl, which is a secondary alkyl group, maybe it's reduced to an ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into a methyl group. But again, I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider the reaction as a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a methyl group, and the substituent remains as isobutyl.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which has substituents at positions 1 and 4. So perhaps the COOH is replaced by a methyl group at position 1, and the substituent remains at position 4 as isobutyl. But initially, the substituent was at position 4 as a sec-butyl. So that would require the substituent to change from sec-butyl to isobutyl.

Wait, how? If the substituent is a sec-butyl (CH2CH(CH2CH3)), perhaps under the reaction conditions, the CH2 group becomes a CH group, making it an isobutyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the CH in the substituent is replaced by a CH2 group. That would change the substituent from sec-butyl to isobutyl. So, the substituent at position 4 would become isobutyl, and the COOH at position 1 becomes methyl.

Wait, but that would require substituting the COOH to methyl and the substituent to isobutyl, leading to option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, no. If the substituent becomes isobutyl, then it would be -CH(CH2CH3)2. So the product would have a substituent at position 4 as isobutyl and position 1 as methyl. That would be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, no, option D has a substituent at position 1 as sec-butyl and position 4 as methyl.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me re-express:

Starting material X: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

After reaction: the COOH is replaced by a methyl group (position 1), and the substituent at position 4 is now a methyl group. But that doesn't fit any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into a methyl group, leading to 4-methylbenzoic acid. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but only the COOH group.

Wait, another thought: if the COOH is converted into a methyl group, then the substituent remains as sec-butyl, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into a methyl group, and the COOH remains, which would be option C again.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with my initial analysis. The product is option C, but that's the starting material. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't change the substituent. Let me think: the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which may not affect the substituent but the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the COOH is protonated and then reacts with HI. Maybe it's a substitution where the COOH becomes CH2I. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is converted into an acid chloride, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. But again, that's not an option.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option C, but that's the starting material. So that can't be the product. Therefore, the product must be something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

The reaction is between X and red phosphorus and HI. X is a carboxylic acid.

Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but X is already a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction isn't about the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl iodide via substitution. But the COOH isn't a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH of the COOH is replaced by an iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the COOH into a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that's not an option.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the IR and NMR data, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C. When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but converts the COOH into something else. But without knowing the exact reaction, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid anhydride, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a hydrogen, but that would require very strong conditions.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the reduction of the COOH to a primary alcohol, but with these reagents, I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the COOH into a ketone. But I don't think that's likely.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, I'm going to go with option C as the product, but that can't be because it's the starting material. So perhaps the correct product is option D.

Wait, no, option D has substituents in different positions. Hmm.

I think I'll have to make a guess. Based on the reaction conditions, perhaps the substituent remains the same, and the COOH is converted into a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But since that's not an option, the next best guess is that the substituent changes to an isobutyl group, making option D the product.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. But how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction causes the substituent to migrate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into an isobutyl group, making option D the product.

I think I've spent too much time on this. Based on the substituent's structure and the reaction conditions, the product is likely option C, but that can't be the case. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but the reaction doesn't change it. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent, and the product is the same as the starting material.

Wait, no, that can't be. The reaction must produce a different product.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the starting material. Let me go back.

IR data: 3400-2500 (broad) indicates an -OH group, likely in a carboxylic acid.

The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is the -OH.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, suggesting para substitution.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely the CH in the substituent.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3.

Putting it all together, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

When treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the COOH into a methyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH to a methyl group. Using HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a way to reduce the acid to an alcohol, but I don't see how that would form a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction adds HI to the COOH, converting it into a diiodide, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is option C, but that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that's not possible.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but transforms the COOH into a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that's the starting material.

Wait, no, the question asks for the product after reaction, so option C can't be the answer. So, I must have made a mistake in identifying X. Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps X isn't a benzoic acid but another compound. Let me reevaluate the IR and NMR.

IR has a peak at 1720, which could be an ester, ketone, or acid. If it's an ester, then the NMR would show an ester group.

But the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is likely an -OH, not an ester.

Wait, perhaps the IR peak at 1720 is an ester, and the broad peak is an alcohol. But that would mean X is an ester with an alcohol group. But the NMR doesn't show an ester's typical peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR peak at 1720 is a ketone.

Wait, if X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be a Clemmensen reduction, converting the ketone to an alkane. But looking at the options, that might fit.

But let's think. If X is a ketone, then the NMR would show a peak around 2.1 ppm for the carbonyl adjacent CH3. But the NMR shows a peak at 2.9 ppm, which is a CH, not a CH3.

Hmm, perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me reevaluate.

If the IR has a peak at 1720, that could be an ester. The broad peak at 3400-2500 could be an alcohol or an amine. But in the options, the products are benzene derivatives, so perhaps X is a benzene ring with an ester group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid's -OH. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the IR peak at 1720 is a carbonyl from an ester, and the broad peak is from an alcohol. But that would imply X is a glycolic ester or something similar.

But the options don't include such compounds. So perhaps my initial conclusion was correct, that X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent but transforms the COOH into a different group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a Br or Cl, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't see how that would fit.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make a guess. Based on the starting material and the options, I'll choose option C as the product, but that's the same as X. So the correct product must be option C. But the question says X reacts, so that can't be the product. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the substituent into a methyl group, making the product 4-methylbenzoic acid. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, I think I've spent too much time on this. Based on the given data, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X, characterized by its IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid), and 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data provides further evidence for a carboxylic acid (-OH at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet) and a para-substituted benzene ring (aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, both doublets). Additional peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

From this analysis, compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is then considered. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids or for reductions, but since X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely modifies the substituent or the carboxylic acid group. However, the reaction conditions are not explicitly clear for this specific transformation.

The options provided are:

- **A)** 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid  
- **B)** 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene  
- **C)** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid  
- **D)** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene  

Option C is the starting material, so it cannot be the product. Option A involves a propanoic acid derivative, which does not align with the reaction conditions or the structure of X. Option B suggests a benzene ring with isobutyl and methyl substituents, but this requires significant structural changes not supported by the reaction conditions. Option D proposes a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4, which also requires a rearrangement not clearly justified.

Given the analysis, the most plausible conclusion is that the reaction does not significantly alter the structure of X, and the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. However, since this is the starting material, the reasoning may have missed a critical step in the reaction mechanism. Based on the provided options, **C** is the only choice consistent with the starting material.

Answer: C
