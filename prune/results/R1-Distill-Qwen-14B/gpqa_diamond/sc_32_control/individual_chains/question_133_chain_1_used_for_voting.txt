Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about phosphate ions and buffer solutions. Hmm, let me see what I remember. So the question says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given, and the temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO4^3- I think.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, the different forms are H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). Oh wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. Oh right, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates. So maybe the question is referring to the concentration of HPO4^2- or another species. Wait, let me read the question again.

Wait, the question is specifically asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's going to dissociate. So in a solution with multiple phosphate species, how do we find the concentration of each?

Wait, but the problem gives us KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that these are buffer solutions. KH2PO4 is a weak acid, and Na2HPO4 is its conjugate base. So together, they form a buffer. The pH of the solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the pKa values.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's going to dissociate into H+ and H2PO4^- (since it's a triprotic acid). So maybe the question is actually about the HPO4^2- concentration because that's one of the species in the buffer.

Wait, no. Let me think. The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's sodium hydrogen phosphate). So in the solution, the primary species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but orthophosphate is H3PO4. So if we're asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, that would be the concentration of H3PO4. But in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and will dissociate. So the concentration of free H3PO4 would be very low. Is that right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the terminology.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "orthophosphate" to refer to the HPO4^2- ion. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the phosphate ion PO4^3-? No, because that's a different species.

Wait, maybe I should think about the phosphate species present. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12). So, the solution contains KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and NaHPO4 (which is HPO4^2-). So these two are in the solution.

So, the solution is a buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the pKa2 value because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Oh wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in solution, H3PO4 is not present in significant amounts because it's a weak acid. So, maybe the question is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is one of the ions present. But that doesn't align with the term "orthophosphate". Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers orthophosphate as HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the dissociation. H3PO4 can lose three protons. So the species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

In the solution given, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4) is the main form, but in solution it dissociates. So the concentration of H3PO4 would be low, but perhaps the question is about the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? No, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a typo and they mean the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-.

Alternatively, maybe the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? Because sometimes, when people refer to the orthophosphate in solution, they mean the HPO4^2- form. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, looking back, the problem states that it's the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps HPO4^2- is the orthophosphate ion. Or maybe they're referring to the species that is considered ortho, meta, etc., but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-? But that's the most deprotonated form, and given the pH here, it's probably not the major species.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering the buffer.

So perhaps the first step is to calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution, then use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- based on that pH and the Ka values.

Wait, but how would that work? Let's think step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each salt.

Molarity is moles per liter. So, for each substance:

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass.

Mass is 1.00 g.

Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.

So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005609 mol.

So volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L.

Concentrations:

[KH2PO4] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[Na2HPO4] = 0.005609 / 0.2 = 0.028045 M.

But wait, in solution, Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028045 M.

Similarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-: so [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M.

So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with concentrations 0.036725 and 0.028045 M, respectively.

So, to find the pH, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

So pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Wait, wait, 6.2e-8: log(6.2) is about 0.79, so log(6.2e-8) is 7.207? Wait, no, because 1e-7 is pH 7. So 6.2e-8 is 0.62 * 1e-7, so the log would be log(6.2) + log(1e-8). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. So log(6.2) is approx 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.792 + (-8) = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208. Wait, wait, no: pKa = -log(Ka), so for Ka = 6.2e-8, pKa is about 7.208.

Wait, let me compute it precisely. Let's compute log(6.2e-8):

log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.79239 -8 = -7.20761. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.028045 / 0.036725 )

Compute the ratio: 0.028045 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7638.

Log of 0.7638 is log(0.7638) ≈ -0.1134.

So pH = 7.2076 -0.1134 ≈ 7.0942.

So the pH of the solution is approximately 7.094.

Now, the next step is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm still not entirely sure about. But perhaps the question is referring to the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is one of the ions in the buffer.

Wait, but HPO4^2- is in the solution from Na2HPO4, but the concentration is 0.028045 M. However, in the buffer, some of it will convert to H2PO4^- and some to PO4^3-. Wait, no, because the pH is around 7.1, which is near pKa2, so the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is about 0.76, which is close to 1, so HPO4^2- concentration is about 0.028 M.

But wait, the question is about the orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is H3PO4, then its concentration would be very low because it's a weak acid. But if orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then it's in the solution as 0.028 M.

But the options given are on the order of 1e-7 M, which is much smaller than 0.028 M. So that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the orthophosphate ions refer to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- combined? But that doesn't make sense because their sum would be about 0.065 M, which is still much higher than 1e-7.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the most deprotonated form. But given the pH is around 7.1, which is higher than pKa2 (7.2), so HPO4^2- is more than H2PO4^-. But PO4^3- is much less because pKa3 is 11.7, so at pH 7.1, PO4^3- would be negligible.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the buffer solution but about the step where H3PO4 dissociates into H2PO4^- and then into HPO4^2-, and so on.

Wait, but we have a solution that's already in a buffer. So perhaps the question is about the concentration of the undissociated H3PO4, which is the orthophosphate.

But if that's the case, how do we calculate it? Since H3PO4 is a weak acid, it dissociates in steps. At pH near 7, the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But if the solution is at pH 7.09, then the concentration of H3PO4 would be minimal. Let's think about the first dissociation.

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-

Ka1 = 7.5e-3.

At pH 7.09, the [H+] is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

So the reaction quotient would be [H+][H2PO4^-]/[H3PO4] = Ka1.

We can rearrange to find [H3PO4] = ( [H2PO4^-] * Ka1 ) / [H+]

We know [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M. [H+] is 8.2e-8.

So:

[H3PO4] = (0.036725 * 7.5e-3) / (8.2e-8)

Let me compute that: numerator is 0.036725 * 0.0075 = 0.0002754375.

Divided by 8.2e-8: 0.0002754375 / 8.2e-8 ≈ 3357.16 M.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, that would imply a concentration higher than the solution itself. That's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the expression for the dissociation of H3PO4 into H+ and H2PO4^-.

The equilibrium is:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-

Ka1 = 7.5e-3.

The initial concentration of H3PO4 would be x (unknown), and at equilibrium, [H+] = 8.2e-8, [H2PO4^-] increases by x, but wait, in our solution, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M. But that's from KH2PO4, which is a strong electrolyte. So the H2PO4^- comes from both the dissociation of H3PO4 and the salt.

Wait, no, because KH2PO4 dissociates completely, so [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M. The H3PO4 is in equilibrium with H+ and H2PO4^-.

So the expression is:

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

We can rearrange to solve for [H3PO4]:

[H3PO4] = ([H+][H2PO4^-]) / Ka1

Plugging in the numbers:

[H3PO4] = (8.2e-8 * 0.036725) / 7.5e-3

Compute numerator: 8.2e-8 * 0.036725 ≈ 3.015e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 3.015e-9 / 7.5e-3 = 4.02e-7 M.

So [H3PO4] is approximately 4.02e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why is this the case? Because H3PO4 is a weak acid and at pH around 7, the concentration is low. So the orthophosphate ion (H3PO4) concentration is about 4e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (H₃PO₄) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of H₃PO₄ in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, with a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation of H₃PO₄ occurs in three steps, but the focus here is on the first dissociation:

\[
\text{H₃PO₄} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{H₂PO₄⁻}
\]

The dissociation constant for this step is \( K_{a1} = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \). The solution is a buffer with contributions from KH₂PO₄ (which provides \(\text{H₂PO₄⁻}\)) and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (which provides \(\text{HPO₄^{2-}}\)). The concentrations of these species are calculated as follows:

1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:
   \[
   \text{Moles of KH₂PO₄} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007345}{0.2} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}
   \]

2. **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:
   \[
   \text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005609 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄^{2-}}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005609}{0.2} \approx 0.028045 \, \text{M}
   \]

The buffer pH is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄^{2-}}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(K_{a2}) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.028045}{0.036725}\right) \approx 7.208 - 0.1134 \approx 7.094
\]

At this pH, the concentration of \(\text{H₃PO₄}\) is determined using the equilibrium expression for the first dissociation:
\[
K_{a1} = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H₃PO₄}]}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{K_{a1}}
\]
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{(8.2 \times 10^{-8})(0.036725)}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx \frac{3.015 \times 10^{-9}}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 4.02 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (\(\text{H₃PO₄}\)) is approximately \(4.02 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
