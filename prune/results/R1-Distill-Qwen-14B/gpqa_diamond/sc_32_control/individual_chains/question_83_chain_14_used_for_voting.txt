Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D with various pH pairs.

Hmm, okay, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form sodium acetate and water. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, I need to find the initial concentration after dilution. Then, determine what happens at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Starting with the initial dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half, because volume doubles. So the new concentration is 0.025 M. Let me compute that:

Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
= 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L)
= 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Okay, that makes sense.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, forming the acetate ion.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles. So, moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed to reach equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence point would be when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

Now, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. That means the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

So the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So the moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume at this point includes the initial diluted solution plus the added NaOH. Let me calculate that.

The initial diluted solution is 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH makes total volume 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

But wait, this is a buffer solution, because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Ka is 1.85e-5. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, wait, more accurately, let's compute 1.85e-5. Let me think, log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

So in the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Plugging in the values:

[A^-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256. Approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, but I need to check the other part.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the dilution. Let me double-check.

Wait, when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the new concentration is 0.025 M, right. So that's correct.

And then, when 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added, the moles are 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Yes, so that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. But since NaOH is a strong base, the solution will consist of the sodium acetate which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

At equivalence, the solution will contain only acetate ions and sodium ions. The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water to form OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So first, let's compute the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence.

Moles of acetate: same as moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 moles.

The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH volume (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will undergo hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me calculate that precisely. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

Since the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, we can set up the expression for Kb.

Let me denote [CH3COO^-] as 0.02 M initially. Let x be the amount that reacts.

So, Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → The equivalence pH here is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, why is the equivalence point pH lower than 9? Did I make an error in calculation.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the Kb calculation. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

But wait, wait, when the solution is at equivalence point, the moles of acetate are 0.001 moles in 0.05 L, so 0.02 M, correct.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. So [OH^-] would be sqrt(Kb * C) if the solution is dilute enough. Let me compute that.

Wait, Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So pOH is about 4.98, which makes pH 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Option A: pH at equivalence is 8.52. That's way lower than my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong approach for the equivalence point. Alternatively, maybe the solution isn't dilute enough, and the approximation isn't valid. Let me try the exact calculation.

The expression is Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Let me set it up:

x^2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x )

Approximating x << 0.02, but let's see. Let me compute x as sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → approx 1.04e-5 as before. So x is about 0.0000104, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

So the pOH is 4.98, pH 9.02.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait another thought: Maybe the solution at equivalence isn't just from acetate. Because when you add strong base to a weak acid, the equivalence solution contains the conjugate base. Wait, but in this case, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me double-check.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 cm³ water, total volume 40 cm³. So 0.001 moles in 0.04 L → 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, all the 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, so 0.001 moles of acetate.

Volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ NaOH (because 10 cm³ is 25% of 40 cm³? No, wait. Wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. The volume of NaOH needed is 10 cm³, so the total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³.

Wait, yes, 50 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should account for the sodium ions, but since Na+ is a spectator ion, it doesn't affect the pH. So that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = ~5.405e-10. Correct.

So, why is the option not matching my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact method instead of approximation.

So, let's set up the equation without approximation.

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Multiply both sides by (0.02 - x):

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x)

x² = 1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

This is a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:

x² + (5.405e-10) x - (1.081e-11) =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.92e-19.

4ac = 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11 → but wait, no, 4ac =4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. Wait, no, in the equation, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. Hmm, but when you compute the discriminant, it's +4ac, because the equation is ax² +bx +c=0. Here, equation is x² + bx +c=0, so D = b² -4ac. Wait, no, wait, wait.

Wait, in the standard quadratic equation ax² +bx +c=0, D = b² -4ac.

In our case, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11=0 → a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approximately 4.324e-11, since 2.92e-19 is negligible.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root because x must be positive.

So x ≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, that gives [OH^-] ≈3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517, so pOH =5.483. pH=14-5.483=8.517, approximately 8.52.

Ah! So that's where option A's 8.52 comes from. I see where I went wrong earlier. Initially, I used the approximation, which gave a higher pH, but when solving the quadratic equation, the pH comes out to about 8.52.

So at equivalence, the pH is approximately 8.52.

Wait, that makes sense because when you have a weak base (acetate) in solution, the pH is less than 9. So option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches.

So, the two pH values are 4.26 (25%) and 8.52 (equivalence). Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but another thought: when I was calculating the pH at 25% titration, did I correctly calculate the concentrations after adding NaOH?

Wait, let me recheck that.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

This reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing the same amount of acetate.

So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001.

After reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 =0.00075 moles of CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Total volume: 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is ~4.733.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] =0.005882/0.017647≈0.3333.

Log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.733-0.477≈4.256 → approximately 4.26.

So that part is correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 (25%) and 8.52 (equivalence), which is option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So option A matches.

Wait, but wait. Another approach for the equivalence point: perhaps using the formula for weak base pH.

The formula is pH = pKa + pKb? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, more accurately, for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH can be calculated using the Kb and the concentration.

Another approach: The solution is 0.02 M acetate. Kb is 5.405e-10.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pOH = (pKb - log C)/2 + something? Or using the formula for weak bases.

Wait, the formula for weak bases is [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C). Wait, but that's when the approximation holds. When Kb*C is small enough, the approximation is valid. Let me calculate Kb*C.

Kb is 5.405e-10, C is 0.02 → Kb*C = 1.081e-11, which is 1e-11. So sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is about 3.16e-6. So [OH^-] ≈ 3.16e-6 → pOH ≈5.5 → pH=8.5.

Which is close to the 8.52 we got earlier. So that makes sense.

Hmm, so why did the initial approximation with the quadratic give me 8.52? Because the assumption that x << C is still valid, as x is about 3e-6 and C is 0.02, so 3e-6 is much less than 0.02.

So the calculations are consistent.

So, the 25% titration pH is ~4.26, and equivalence is ~8.52. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, giving moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is:

\[
\text{New concentration} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Using the formula for weak base hydrolysis:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** 4.26; 8.52  
- **B)** 3.17; 6.73  
- **C)** 4.73; 7.00  
- **D)** 4.57; 6.92  

The correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
