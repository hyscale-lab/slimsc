Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and asks for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let's see what the details are.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Hmm, so they're moving in the same direction. But wait, the question is about their relative speed. Oh right, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction because of the velocity addition formula. I remember that the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different from the classical case.

First, I need to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, astronaut A (2m) is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B (3m) at 0.5c. So from B's frame, what's A's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, no. Actually, relative speed would be the speed of one as seen from the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, in A's frame, B would be moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. But wait, that's in the opposite direction, but when dealing with relativity, the velocities don't just subtract like that. Oh right, because the velocity addition formula is different.

The formula for relative velocity u' (the velocity of object B as seen from A) is given by (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of B in the original frame, and v is the velocity of A (since A is moving at v relative to the original frame). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Let me think: the original frame is, say, the lab frame where A is moving at v and B at u. We want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So in this case, v is A's velocity (0.6c) and u is B's velocity (0.5c). So the relative speed u' would be (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²). Oh wait, wait, no. Because velocities in the same direction, so u is 0.5c and v (A's speed) is 0.6c. So u is less than v, so from A's perspective, B is moving backward? Or wait, no, if both are moving in the same direction, but B is slower than A, then in A's frame, B would be moving backward? Hmm, maybe that's correct.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. So u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c.

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)) 
= (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²)
= (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3 c² / c²)
= (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)
= (-0.1c) / 0.7
= - (0.1/0.7) c
Which is approximately -0.1428 c. The negative sign indicates direction. So the relative speed is 0.1428c in the opposite direction, but since speed is a scalar, the magnitude is 0.1428c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed, which is about 0.14c, so that aligns.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the formula for relative velocity is (u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the observer, which is A's frame here). So u is B's velocity (0.5c), and v is A's velocity (0.6c). So yes, that calculation is correct. So the relative speed is (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5 * 0.6)) c. So that's -0.1 / (1 - 0.3) ) = -0.1 / 0.7 c, which is about -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.143c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have this.

Now, the second part is calculating the total energy of the system. So total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A (2m, v=0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)
= 1 / sqrt(0.64)
= 1/0.8
= 1.25

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (3m, v=0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)
= 1 / sqrt(0.75)
= 1 / (√(3/4)) )
= 1 / ( (√3)/2 )
= 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E_A + E_B = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So that's about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B says E=4.96 mc². So option C's energy is correct.

Now, let's check the options again:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That matches both the relative speed and the total energy.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc². The energy here is way off, so it's incorrect.

Wait a second, but wait, the problem statement says "the total energy of the system." Oh wait, wait, wait. Hmm. If these are two objects moving in the same frame, their energies add. But wait, if the system is two objects, maybe the rest energy is the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies, but in relativity, the total energy includes all their relativistic energies.

Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding. No, in relativity, each object's energy is gamma*mc², so for the system, it's the sum of each individual energy.

Let me recalculate the energies.

Astronaut A:

v = 0.6c,

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1.25.

Mass is 2m, so E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B:

v =0.5c,

gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Mass is 3m, E_B= 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

So total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So looking at the options:

Option C: E=5.96 mc².

Option D: E=5 mc², which is lower, so it's not correct.

So the correct option is C: v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc^2.

Alternatively, the options may have exact numbers. Let me compute more precisely.

Gamma for A: 1.25 is exact.

Gamma for B: 1/sqrt(3/4) = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.154700538.

E_B = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6 m c²)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3) m c^2 ≈ 3.4641 m c².

E_A = 2.5 m c².

Total E: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 ≈ 5.96 m c².

So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut in the lab frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is a scalar, so the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A:
- Mass \( m_A = 2m \),
- Velocity \( v_A = 0.6c \).

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot m_A c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B:
- Mass \( m_B = 3m \),
- Velocity \( v_B = 0.5c \).

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot m_B c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
- The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), which matches options C and D.
- The total energy is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \), which matches option C.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
