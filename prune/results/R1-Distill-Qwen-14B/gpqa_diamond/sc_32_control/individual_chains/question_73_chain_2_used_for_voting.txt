Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just add them normally because of relativity. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is needed here. But wait, what's the formula again? Oh yeah, it's something like (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). 

Wait no, that's when you're transforming between different frames. But here, we're looking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So if one is moving at u and the other at v, from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh wait, in the frame of the first astronaut (let's say the first is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c in the same direction), the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Wait, no. Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the first's frame, the second is approaching at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/c²). Wait, no, that's not right. Let's get it right.

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the second object as measured in the first's frame. Wait, in the rest frame, the two are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is approaching. So u is the velocity of the second in the lab frame, which is 0.5c, and v is the first's velocity, which is 0.6c. Or wait, no. Wait, the lab frame is the one where the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. So when calculating the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame, we're looking for u', which is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) where u is the velocity of the second in the lab frame and v is the velocity of the first.

Wait, so u is 0.5c, v is 0.6c. So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) => (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) => (-0.1c)/(0.7) => approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction; since the second astronaut is moving slower, from the first's perspective, the second is approaching at 0.1428c. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c, which matches option C and D. So that's the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Energy in relativity is given by gamma * m c². So each astronaut's energy is their gamma multiplied by their rest energy.

First astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 m c². Which matches option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the correct answer for both parts is option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relative speed between them is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

1. **First astronaut (mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
