Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that SMEFT is used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model in a systematic way using higher-dimensional operators. Now the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are numbered 1 to 4, and the possible choices are A to D. Let me think about each symmetry.

Option 1 is Lorentz Symmetry. I think that's a big one. Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM. So all the operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because otherwise, you'd have operators that break relativity, which isn't the case in the SM.

Option 2 is Poincaré symmetry. Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz symmetric, it should also respect Poincaré because it's a bigger symmetry. But wait, in effective field theories, we usually consider the symmetries of the underlying theory. The SM respects Poincaré, so SMEFT should too. So both 1 and 2 would be correct? Or maybe they're considering something else?

Wait, no. Wait, Lorentz symmetry is part of the Poincaré group. So if a theory respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about the operators in SMEFT. Do they have to respect Poincaré symmetry? I think they do. So if the question is asking which must be respected, both 1 and 2 would be correct, but looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Option 3 is CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry because of certain processes like kaon mixing. But wait, does SMEFT require all operators to respect CP? No, I don't think so. SMEFT operators can have CP violation. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation, and SMEFT can include higher-dimensional operators that also violate CP. So 3 is probably not a must-respect symmetry.

Option 4 is CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, all renormalizable theories respect CPT symmetry. Because the SM is a renormalizable theory, and SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM, it's likely that CPT is respected. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. Otherwise, you'd have a violation in a way that the underlying SM doesn't allow.

Wait, but do higher-dimensional operators necessarily respect CPT? Because CPT symmetry in the SM is tied to the fact that it's a renormalizable theory, but I'm not entirely sure. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so I think it still must respect CPT symmetry because that's part of the framework.

So putting it together:

Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: Since Lorentz is a subset, but I think Poincaré is also required. Because SMEFT is built in a way that it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, which would imply Poincaré invariance. So yes.

3. CP symmetry: No, operators can violate CP.

4. CPT symmetry: Yes, because the SM has it, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built on that.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says 1,2,4. Option A says 1,2. So what's the right answer?

Wait, but is Poincaré symmetry automatically included if Lorentz is? Because the Poincaré group includes translations in space and time, but SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators, but perhaps the question is about the gauge group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps SMEFT doesn't necessarily require Poincaré symmetry, but I think it does because it's built upon the SM which is Poincaré invariant.

Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect Poincaré. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct. So the symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, in SMEFT, all the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, so Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Poincaré includes translations, but in the effective theory, operators are built as local terms, so I think they must respect Poincaré. So 1 and 2 are correct. Then option 4, CPT, yes. So the correct answer is C: 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) using higher-dimensional operators. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory of the SM, which respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory and is constructed as a low-energy effective theory of the SM, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like kaon mixing. Similarly, SMEFT operators can violate CP symmetry, as they can include higher-dimensional operators that allow for CP violation. Thus, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is respected in the SM and is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built on the SM, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:
