Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So I'm trying to figure out what kind of geometry this describes. I remember that in GR, the metric tells us about the spacetime curvature, and for a sphere, the metric would have terms like (1 - (2GM)/(rc²)) or something similar, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a hyperbolic space. I think in 2D, a pseudosphere has a metric that's similar to hyperbolic space. Maybe this metric is describing a 2D hyperbolic geometry.

Looking at the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². That looks a bit like the expression for a sphere in 3D, where the radius squared is 4, so the sphere would have radius 2. But here, since it's a 2D metric (only dx and dy), perhaps it's embedded in a 3D space or not? Wait, maybe it's a 2D hyperbolic space.

I remember that in hyperbolic space, the metric can be written in different forms. One common form is the Poincaré disk model, where the metric is ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)] (dx² + dy²), where R is the radius of the hyperbolic space. Comparing that to the given metric, the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²) which is 4*(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the given metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model with R=2. So that must mean this is a 2D hyperbolic space with radius 2.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D hyperbolic space, but maybe the question is simplifying it to 2D. Or perhaps the metric is for a 2-sphere embedded in some way. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the term pseudosphere is sometimes used to describe a surface in 3D with constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But the metric provided seems to be in 2D. So maybe the question is using 'pseudosphere' in a 2D context, or perhaps it's a typo and they meant 2D hyperbolic space.

But regardless, the question is about the area. So, for a 2D hyperbolic space with radius R, the total area is infinite. Because hyperbolic space extends infinitely. But wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the disk has a finite radius, but the area is still infinite because the curvature causes the space to expand infinitely as you approach the boundary.

Wait, no, wait. The area of the entire hyperbolic plane (which is unbounded) is infinite. But if the metric is defined on a finite region, like a disk of radius 2, then perhaps that's a compact space. Wait, but the denominator (4 - x² - y²) would mean that x² + y² < 4. So the metric is defined only in the region where x² + y² < 4. So it's a disk of radius 2. But wait, what's the geometry of this disk?

In the Poincaré model, the disk is a model of hyperbolic space, but it's not compact. The area is still infinite because the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. But if this were a sphere, the area would be 4πr². But here, it's a pseudosphere, which in 3D is a different case, but maybe for 2D it's similar to the hyperbolic plane.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, no, pseudosphere in 3D has finite area, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, the pseudosphere is a surface, like a tractricoid, which has finite area but infinite length along the surface. Wait, that's for the tractricoid, which is a surface in 3D with finite area but infinite length.

But I'm getting confused because the given metric is in 2D. Let me think again. The given metric is in 2D, so it's a 2D surface. So the area would be the integral of the area element over the entire space.

The area element in this metric would be sqrt(g) dx dy. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), so the determinant of the metric tensor is g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))², because it's diagonal with both components equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, no, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms for 2D, so g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, so the area would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4, since the denominator must be positive. So the area would be the integral of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy over the region x² + y² <4.

To compute this, it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let's let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The area A = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

First, compute the θ integral. ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Now the radial integral: ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr.

Wait, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 / u ] * (-du/2).

Wait, let's swap the limits to remove the negative sign: ∫ from 0 to4 [32/(u)] * (du/2).

Wait, 32 * (1/2) =16. So the integral is 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4 is ln(4) - ln(0). Wait, wait, no, wait. The integral from 0 to 4 of 1/u du is ln(u) evaluated from 0 to 4. But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral diverges to infinity.

Oh, that can't be right. But wait, the original integral was from r=0 to 2. So when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the integral ∫0^4 (1/u) du would be divergent. So the area becomes infinite.

Wait, but that's the area of the entire 2D space described by the metric. Because the metric is defined for x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2, but the area element becomes infinite as you approach the boundary because the denominator (4 - r²) approaches zero, making the area element blow up.

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model, the area element is (4/(R² - r²))² * r dr dθ, but wait, no, earlier I thought the area element was [4/(1 - (r²/R²))] * r dr dθ. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the models.

Wait, no, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = [4 R^2/(R^2 - r^2)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk with radius R. So the area element is [4 R^2/(R^2 - r^2)^2] * r dr dθ.

Wait, but in our case, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 -r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), because dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric tensor is diagonal with (32/(4 - r²)) for dr² and (32/(4 - r²)) r² for dθ²? Wait, wait no. Actually, no, the metric is written in terms of dx² + dy², which in polar coordinates becomes dr² + r² dθ². So the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, so the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ. Wait, but in 2D, the determinant is (g_rr * g_θθ - g_rθ²) = (32/(4 -r²)) * [ (32/(4 - r^2)) r² ] = [ (32)^2 r² ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, no, wait. No, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just (32/(4 - r^2))^2 * r^2. Because in polar coordinates, the line element is g_rr dr² + g_θθ r² dθ², so the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ.

Wait, no, the area element in polar coordinates is g_rr dr * g_θθ dθ * r, but wait, no, more accurately, the area element is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ g_θr) dr dθ. Since it's diagonal, g_rθ = 0, so the area element is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ.

So g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is [32/(4 - r²)] * r².

So the determinant is (32/(4 -r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = [ (32)^2 r² ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

So the area element is sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) dr dθ = (32 r)/(4 - r^2) dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral over the entire space, which is r from 0 to 2 (since x² + y² <4 → r <2), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r^2)] dr dθ.

As I thought earlier, the θ integral is 2π, so A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr.

Let me compute that integral.

Let me set u = 4 - r^2 → du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So integral becomes 32 ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r^2) → 32 ∫ [ - (du/2) ] / u = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

Wait, but the limits change. When r=0 → u=4. When r=2 → u=0.

So after substitution, the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (1/u) du.

We can reverse the limits and remove the negative sign:

32 * (1/2) ∫ from u=0 to u=4 (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is ln(4) - ln(0). Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral is divergent. So the area is infinite.

Wait, so the area is infinite. But the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So in the options, option D is +infinity. So would the correct answer be D?

Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps the metric is for a compact space, so the area is finite. But according to the integral, the area diverges. So the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Let me think again.

Another approach: the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's see if this is conformally flat. It is, as it's a multiple of the flat metric.

The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² dx dy.

Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. The metric is diagonal with both terms equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, but the area element is sqrt( determinant ), which is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but earlier calculation contradicts that. Oh wait, no. Wait, for a metric conformally equivalent to flat space, the area element is (g_factor)^2 dx dy. Wait, no, more accurately, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ g_θr) dr dθ. If the metric is diagonal, then it's sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ.

In the given metric, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²) times the flat metric. So in 2D, the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 times dx dy? No, that's not correct. Because the area element in 2D is sqrt( determinant ) dx dy. The determinant is g_rr * g_θθ - g_rθ². Since diagonal, it's g_rr * g_θθ.

Wait, but in Cartesian coordinates, the metric is diagonal with both terms being 32/(4 - x² - y²). So determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. So area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, wait, no! Wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt( determinant ) dx dy. The determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. So sqrt of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but this seems different from what I thought before. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, another way: for a 2D metric ds² = E dx² + G dy², the area element is sqrt(EG) dx dy. So in this case, E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So sqrt(EG) = sqrt( [32/(4 - (x² + y²))]^2 ) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, so the total area would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Converting to polar coordinates again: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the area A is ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Which is 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Same as before. The integral evaluates to ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute it again.

Let me set u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (r dr) = - du/2.

When r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is same as 16 ∫ [1/u] du from u=0 to u=4.

So the integral is 16 [ln(u)] from 0 to4 → 16 (ln4 - ln0). But ln0 is negative infinity, so the integral diverges to infinity.

So the area is infinite.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D, +infinity.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This describes a 2D hyperbolic space embedded in a Poincaré disk model with radius \( R = 2 \). The metric is conformally flat, and the area element is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. For a 2D metric \( ds^2 = E \, dx^2 + G \, dy^2 \), the area element is:

\[
\sqrt{EG} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Here, \( E = G = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), so the determinant of the metric is:

\[
\sqrt{EG} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate this area element over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-du/2}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(0) \right].
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area of the space described by the metric is infinite.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**D) \( +\infty \).**
