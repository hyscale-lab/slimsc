Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, if this matrix is a density matrix, it must be a valid one, meaning it's positive semi-definite and has a trace of 1.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position here? I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented on a Bloch sphere. But wait, the density matrix is for a mixed state, so how does that translate?

The given ρ looks like it's a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Yeah, because it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So that's like 50% in state |0⟩ and 50% in state |1⟩. 

In Bloch sphere terms, the pure states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are at the poles. |0⟩ is at (0,0,1) and |1⟩ is at (0,0,-1) maybe? Or wait, sometimes the z-axis is considered with |0⟩ at (0,0,1) and |1⟩ at (0,0,-1). Or sometimes it's the other way around. Hmm, not too sure, but I think the point is that a mixed state that's equally between |0⟩ and |1⟩ would be at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, because the Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, and the center is (0,0,0). So if the state is completely mixed, like a maximally mixed state, that's represented at the origin. But wait, isn't the maximally mixed state for a qubit the one where it's equally likely to be |0⟩ and |1⟩? Because for a qubit, the density matrix would be (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Oh, so that's exactly the ρ given here.

So if that's the case, the geometric position would be the origin in the Bloch sphere. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer must be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Are there other ways a density matrix could be represented in the qubit space? I remember that the Bloch sphere is a way to represent pure states, but for mixed states, the density matrix can't be represented as a single point on the Bloch sphere. Instead, it's more about the expectation values.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the approaches. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the vector in the qubit's Hilbert space that represents the state. For a density matrix, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices can be used to represent the state as a vector. The expectation values are ⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, ⟨σ_z⟩. The vector (r) would be (⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, ⟨σ_z⟩).

So let me compute those expectation values. The density matrix is ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Alternatively, ρ can be written as (I/2), since I is the identity matrix and I/2 is the maximally mixed state.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So let's compute ⟨σ_x⟩ = Tr(ρ σ_x). 

ρ is (1/2) [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by σ_x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], the product is (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So the trace is 0 + 0 = 0. Similarly for σ_y: same thing. σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so ρ σ_y is (1/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], trace is 0. For σ_z, ρ σ_z is (1/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The trace is (1/2)(1 + (-1)) = 0. So all expectation values are zero.

Thus, the vector (r) representing the state in the qubit space would be (0,0,0), which corresponds to option C. So the correct answer is C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are located at the poles \((0,0,1)\) and \((0,0,-1)\), respectively. However, a mixed state like this one cannot be represented as a single point on the Bloch sphere. Instead, its position is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), and \( \sigma_z \), which are calculated as follows:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x), \quad \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y), \quad \langle \sigma_z \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z).
\]

The given density matrix \(\rho\) is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{2}I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For \(\rho \sigma_x\), \(\rho \sigma_y\), and \(\rho \sigma_z\), the trace of each product is zero because the off-diagonal terms cancel out, leaving no contribution to the trace. Thus, the expectation values are:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0, \quad \langle \sigma_y \rangle = 0, \quad \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.
\]

This corresponds to the vector \((r) = (0,0,0)\), which represents the origin in the qubit space. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin.
