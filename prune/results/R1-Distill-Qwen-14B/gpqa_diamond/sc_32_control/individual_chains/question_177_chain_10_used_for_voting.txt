Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and think through how to approach it.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some information: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. But wait, the mass might not be directly relevant here. Hmm, the question is about luminosity, so maybe mass isn't a factor unless it's connected to something else. Let me note that.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength emitted by a star depends on its temperature. This is according to Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. No, Wien's Law says that λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, their peak emission is at the same wavelength, implying same temperature.

Alright, so both stars have the same temperature. So T1 = T2 = T.

Now, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both are black bodies, this applies.

So, let's compute the luminosity ratio L1/L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T^4
L2 = 4π R2² σ T^4

Dividing L1 by L2:

(L1/L2) = (R1² / R2²) * (T^4 / T^4) = (R1²)/(R2²)

Because T is the same for both.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2².

Thus, (L1/L2) = 2.25.

Wait, but the options are 2.25, 2.32, etc. Option A is 2.25, which would fit.

But wait, the question also mentions radial velocities. The radial velocities are given as zero for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, so Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed luminosity?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. So Star_1 isn't moving towards or away, and Star_2 is moving, but does that affect the intrinsic luminosity? Or is this a redshift or blueshift effect?

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So if the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. However, when considering their intrinsic properties, like luminosity, the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity information is a red herring here, or maybe it's used for calculating something else, but in the context of the problem, since the question is about the luminosity ratio, which is an intrinsic property, perhaps the radial velocity doesn't directly affect it. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, and flux depends on distance and velocity.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the astronomers calculated the luminosity, so perhaps they corrected for any Doppler effects. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would affect the observed wavelength. But since the problem says that their peak wavelengths are the same, maybe that includes any Doppler shifts.

Wait, I might have to think again. The peak wavelengths are observed to be the same. So their intrinsic peak wavelengths are same, but if they are moving, say, Star_2 is moving, then the observed wavelength would be shifted.

Wait, let me clarify. For Star_1, radial velocity is zero, so no shift. For Star_2, radial velocity is 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving towards us, that would blueshift its spectrum. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 would be shorter than its rest wavelength. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max would be λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) ), but this is getting into Doppler shift calculations.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, if Star_2 is moving, its actual (intrinsic) temperature must be different to make the observed λ_max the same as Star_1.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let me think again.

Let me denote the following:

Let T1 be the actual temperature of Star_1, and T2 be the actual temperature of Star_2.

Star_1 has radial velocity v1 = 0, so its observed λ_max is λ1 = b / T1.

Star_2 has radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving towards us. Then, the observed wavelength would be λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) ) )

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, I might have the signs mixed. Let me recall: when a source is moving towards you, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ).

Wait, no, the exact formula for relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β) / (1 - β) ) ), where β = v/c.

But wait, when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so λ_obs < λ_rest. So the formula for blueshift is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The standard Doppler shift formula for frequency is f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ) when the source is moving towards the observer. Since f = c/λ, this would imply λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) )

So yes, λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

In this problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs

But λ1_obs is just λ_rest of Star_1, since v1=0. So λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v2/c = 700e3 / (3e5) ≈ 0.002333.

Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e5 km/s, so 3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s. So 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. So v2 is 7e5 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So β =7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333.

Wait, wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 /3e8 = 0.002333. So β is 0.002333.

So, sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) = sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) )

Calculating that:

0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99536. Square root is approximately 0.99768.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 0.99768.

But the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = 0.99768 * λ2_rest

So, λ1_rest = 0.99768 * λ2_rest.

But λ_rest is b / T. So:

b / T1 = 0.99768 * (b / T2 )

Cancel b: 1/T1 = 0.99768 / T2 → T2 = T1 * 0.99768.

So, T2 = T1 * 0.99768 ≈ 0.99768 T1.

So, their temperatures are not the same. Oh wait, but earlier I thought that because λ_obs is same, their T_rest must be same. But that's not correct because of the Doppler shift. So I need to correct that.

So, T2 = T1 * 0.99768.

Now, considering that, what is the luminosity ratio?

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1^2 / R2^2 = (2.25) R2^2 / R2^2 = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1 / T2 )^4 = (1 / 0.99768 )^4.

Compute 1 / 0.99768 ≈ 1.00233. Raise to the 4th power.

(1.00233)^4 ≈ Let's compute:

First, ln(1.00233) ≈ 0.002327. Multiply by 4: ≈ 0.009308. Exponentiate: e^0.009308 ≈ 1.00936.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 1.00936.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00936 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00936 ≈ 2.27.

Wait, so 2.25 * 1.00936.

Let me compute 2.25 * 1.00936.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.00936 ≈ 0.02106.

So total is approximately 2.25 + 0.02106 = 2.27106.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.271.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.27 is not exactly any of the options, but the closest is option B at 2.32. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the Doppler shift factor.

Wait, let me recalculate the Doppler shift more accurately.

v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s → v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333333.

So, (1 - β) = 1 - 0.00233333 = 0.997666667

(1 + β) = 1.002333333

So the ratio (1 - β)/(1 + β) = 0.997666667 / 1.002333333 ≈ 0.995334.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.995334) ≈ 0.997665.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 0.997665.

So, λ2_rest = λ2_obs / 0.997665 ≈ λ2_obs * 1.00234.

But wait, since λ1_rest = λ2_obs (because their observed λ_max are same), so λ2_rest = λ1_rest * 1.00234.

So, λ2_rest = 1.00234 * λ1_rest.

But λ is inversely proportional to T. So, T2 = (b / λ2_rest) = (b / (1.00234 * λ1_rest )) = T1 / 1.00234.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 / 1.00234) ≈ T1 * 0.99767.

Wait, that's the same as before. So T1/T2 = 1 / 0.99767 ≈ 1.00234.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.00234)^4.

Let me compute (1.00234)^4 more accurately.

1.00234 squared is (approx):

1.00234 * 1.00234 = 1 + 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 1.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 1.004686.

Now, square that again: (1.004686)^2 ≈ ?

= (1 + 0.004686)^2 = 1 + 2*0.004686 + (0.004686)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009372 + 0.0000219 ≈ 1.009394.

So, (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.009394.

So, (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.009394.

Thus, L1/L2 = (2.25) * 1.009394 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009394 = let's compute.

2.25 * 1.009394.

1.009394 = 1 + 0.009394.

So, 2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.009394 ≈ 0.021138.

So total ≈ 2.25 + 0.021138 = 2.271138.

So, approximately 2.271.

Looking back at the options, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, none of the options are 2.27. The closest is A) 2.25 and D) 2.23. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but since we're calculating the luminosity, which is intrinsic, perhaps the radial velocities don't matter. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, while flux depends on distance and Doppler shift. But in this problem, the luminosities are computed. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation of luminosity.

Wait, but the problem states: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, the computation of luminosity would take into account any Doppler shifts, because the observed wavelengths would be used. So, perhaps the fact that Star_2 is moving affects the observed wavelength, which affects the calculation of its temperature, and hence luminosity.

Wait, but without that, we'd have a ratio of 2.25. But when considering the Doppler shift, the ratio is higher. So the correct factor is around 2.27, which is not among the options, but the options have option B as ~2.32, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the Doppler factor again.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the Doppler factor more accurately.

We have v =700 km/s. So v/c=700000/3e5=700000/(300000) = 7/30 = 0.233333... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Wait, hold on a minute, I think I made a big mistake here.

No, no, wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. c is approx 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 7e5 /3e8 = 0.002333. Which is about 0.2333% the speed of light. Not 0.2333, but 0.002333.

So, beta is 0.002333, not 0.2333. So, 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light.

So, the Doppler shift factor.

Wait, so let's correct the beta calculation.

v =700,000 m/s. c = 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333... ? Wait, no.

Wait, 7e5 is 700,000, 3e8 is 300,000,000.

So, 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.023333333.

Oh! I see, I made a mistake earlier. I thought 700e3 was 7e5, but wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, which is 7e5 m/s.

Wait, no, wait: 1 km is 1e3 m, so 700 km/s is 700 * 1e3 m/s = 7e5 m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So v/c =7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.0233333...

So beta is 0.0233333.

So, (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (0.9766667)/(1.0233333) ≈ 0.954.

Wait, let me compute (1 - beta) = 1 - 0.023333 = 0.9766667.

(1 + beta)=1.0233333.

Dividing: 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 ≈ 0.954.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.9766667 / 1.0233333.

Let me do this division:

1.0233333 * 0.955 ≈ 1.0233333 * 0.95 = approx 0.972166685, and 0.005 * 1.0233333 ≈ 0.0051166665.

Adding, 0.972166685 + 0.0051166665 ≈ 0.97728335.

But the numerator is 0.9766667, which is a bit less than 0.97728335. So, 0.955 would give product 0.97728335, which is more than 0.9766667.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the exact value.

Compute 0.9766667 ÷ 1.0233333.

Let me write it as a fraction.

0.9766667 ≈ 9766667e-7, and 1.0233333≈ 10233333e-7.

So 9766667 / 10233333 ≈ ?

Let me compute 9766667 ÷ 10233333.

Well, 10233333 * 0.954 = ?

0.95 * 10233333 = 9721666.35

0.004 * 10233333 = 40933.332

So 0.954 → 9721666.35 +40933.332 = 9762599.68.

Which is close to 9766667. So 0.954 * 1.0233333 ≈ 0.976259968.

The numerator is 0.9766667, which is a bit higher.

So, the difference is 0.9766667 - 0.976259968 ≈ 0.000406732.

Which is how much more is needed beyond 0.954.

Each 0.0001 increase in the multiplier would add approximately 1023.3333 to the product.

So, 0.000406732 / 1023.3333 ≈ 0.000000397.

Wait, perhaps that's getting too detailed. Let me think of it as 0.954 + (0.000406732 / 1.0233333) ≈ 0.954 + 0.000397 ≈ 0.954397.

So, the ratio (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ≈ 0.9544.

So sqrt(0.9544) ≈ ?

Well, sqrt(0.95) is about 0.9746, sqrt(0.9544) would be a bit higher.

Let me compute 0.977^2 = 0.954529. Because 0.977 * 0.977 = (0.97 + 0.007)^2 = 0.97^2 + 2*0.97*0.007 + 0.007^2 = 0.9409 + 0.01358 + 0.000049 = 0.954529.

So sqrt(0.9544) is approximately 0.977 - because 0.977^2 = 0.954529, which is very close to 0.9544.

So, sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 0.977.

But since λ1_rest = λ2_obs (because observed wavelengths are same), we have:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 0.977 → λ2_rest = λ1_rest / 0.977 ≈ 1.0235 * λ1_rest.

So, T2 is related to T1 via λ_rest = b / T.

So, λ2_rest = 1.0235 * λ1_rest.

So, T2 = T1 / 1.0235 ≈ 0.9766 * T1.

So, T1 / T2 ≈ 1.0235.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = (1.0235)^4.

Compute (1.0235)^4.

First, square 1.0235: 1.0235^2 = approx 1.0477.

Then, square 1.0477: 1.0477^2 ≈ 1.0984.

So, (1.0235)^4 ≈ 1.0984.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * 1.0984.

(1.5)^2 is 2.25.

So, 2.25 * 1.0984 ≈ 2.472.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the ratio over 2.4, but the options don't have that. Wait, what am I doing wrong here.

Wait, no, because R1 =1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 is 2.25.

T1 is larger than T2, so their ratio would make L1 even bigger.

Wait, but earlier calculations without considering Doppler gave L1/L2 ≈2.27, and when considering Doppler, perhaps the ratio would be higher.

Wait, but in this calculation, I think I made a mistake in the Doppler shift direction.

Wait, when a star is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter than its rest wavelength. So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is less than its rest λ_max.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, Star_1 has v=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has v=700 km/s towards us, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ).

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, then:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

→ λ2_rest = λ1_rest / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

= λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

= λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + 0.0233333)/(1 - 0.0233333) )

= λ1_rest * sqrt( 1.0233333 / 0.9766667 )

Which is sqrt(1.04798) ≈ 1.0236.

So, λ2_rest = λ1_rest * 1.0236.

Which means that T2 = T1 / 1.0236 ≈ 0.9766 T1.

So, T1/T2 = 1.0236.

Then, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.0236)^4.

Compute that:

1.0236 squared: 1.0236 * 1.0236.

1.0236 * 1 = 1.0236

1.0236 * 0.02 = 0.020472

Wait, better to compute it as (1 + 0.0236)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0236 + (0.0236)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0472 + 0.00055696 ≈ 1.04775696.

So, (1.0236)^2 ≈ 1.04775696.

Square that again for ^4:

1.04775696^2 = (1.04775696)^2.

Compute 1.04775696 * 1.04775696.

Let me approximate it:

1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816

0.00775696 * 1.04775696 ≈ approximately 0.0081.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: compute (1.04775696)^2.

= (1 + 0.04775696)^2 = 1 + 2*0.04775696 + (0.04775696)^2.

= 1 + 0.09551392 + 0.0022813.

≈ 1.097795.

So, (1.0236)^4 ≈ 1.0978.

So, L1/L2 = (2.25) * 1.0978 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0978.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.0978 = approx 0.2193.

Total: 2.25 + 0.2193 = 2.4693.

Hmm, that's about 2.47. But none of the options are nearly that. The options are 2.25, 2.32, 2.35, 2.23.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps we're supposed to ignore the Doppler shift because the velocity is small, and the ratio is approximately 2.25, so option A.

But in that case, the problem mentions the Doppler velocities, so perhaps they are essential.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed fluxes would be affected by the Doppler shift, but since the luminosity is computed from the blackbody spectrum, they account for that. Let me rethink.

Wait, the luminosity calculation for a star as a black body would depend on its intrinsic properties: radius and temperature. The observed flux would depend on distance and any Doppler shifts, but the actual luminosity is an intrinsic property.

Wait, but when you observe a star, you measure the flux. To get the luminosity, you need to correct for distance and any effects like extinction. But in this problem, perhaps the astronomers have already done that. Or maybe they haven't, and the luminosity ratio is affected by Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply assuming that both have the same temperature because their observed peak wavelengths are the same, and thus L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, making the answer A.

But wait, that's the case only if their temperatures are the same, which would be the case if the Doppler shift were not considered. Because when you have the same observed wavelength, if there's no Doppler shift, then the temperatures are the same. But if there is a Doppler shift, the temperatures are different.

So, perhaps the problem is considering that the Doppler shift is ignored because the velocities are small. Let me see: 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light. The Doppler effect would cause a small shift, but perhaps in the context of a problem like this, it's neglected.

Wait, but the problem gives the velocities, so perhaps it's meant to be considered.

So, let me recompute the luminosity ratio considering the Doppler shift.

Earlier, I got L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0978 ≈ 2.47.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me approach this differently.

The observed flux from a star depends on its luminosity and distance, but the question is about the computed luminosity, which would require knowing the distance. But the problem doesn't mention distance, so perhaps it's considering that the stars are at the same distance, making the fluxes directly related to luminosities. But that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the problem states that the luminosity is computed, so perhaps the astronomers have accounted for that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should not consider the Doppler effect in the luminosity calculation because luminosity is an intrinsic property. The observed flux depends on Doppler shift, but the luminosity itself is R^2 T^4, regardless of Doppler.

Wait, but in that case, the fact that the observed λ_max are the same would imply that the stars have the same temperature. Because without considering Doppler shift, their observed λ_max would be the same, so T is same.

But that's not the case because Star_2 is moving, so its T must be different to have the same observed λ_max.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the Doppler effect, assuming that the velocities are negligible, and so the temperatures are same.

In that case, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But why would the problem include the velocities then? Maybe it's a red herring, and the intended solution is to not consider the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, which gives 2.27, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 2.25, option A.

But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Doppler shift. Let me try another approach.

Wait, the formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, rearranged, λ_rest = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But since λ_obs is same for both stars, λ1_rest = λ_obs, and λ2_rest = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Thus, λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which implies that T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Because λ_rest is b / T, so λ2_rest = b / T2 and λ1_rest = b / T1.

Thus, T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) )

= T1 * sqrt( (0.976667)/(1.023333) )

= T1 * sqrt( 0.9544 )

≈ T1 * 0.977.

So, T2 ≈ 0.977 T1.

So, T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 0.977 ≈ 1.0235.

Now, (T1 / T2)^4 = (1.0235)^4 ≈ as calculated earlier, about 1.0984.

Thus, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (1.0984) ≈ 2.472.

But again, this leads to a value not in the options. The options are all near 2.25-2.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the Doppler shift is different for wavelength when moving towards the observer.

Let me check: when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), which is correct.

So, for Star_2, moving towards us, the observed λ_max is λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, so:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, λ2_rest = λ1_rest / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Since λ_rest = b / T,

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b / (λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )) )

= (b / λ1_rest) ) * (1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

= T1 * (1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is what I had earlier.

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

v/c is 0.023333, so (1 - v/c) = 0.976667, (1 + v/c)=1.023333.

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.9544.

So sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

Thus, T2 = 0.977 T1.

So, T1/T2 = 1.0235.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.0984.

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.0984 = 2.25 * 1.0984 ≈ 2.472.

Hmm. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is misstated. Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the Doppler shift because the problem mentions that the wavelength at which they appear brightest is the same, implying same T, so L1/L2 = 2.25, option A.

But why include the Doppler velocities then? Maybe the problem intended for us to ignore the Doppler shift, considering that velocities are small.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are given to confuse, and the main point is that same peak wavelength implies same T, so L ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

So, the intended answer is option A.

But I'm a bit torn because the problem gives the velocities, which suggests that they are relevant. But perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler shift.

Given the multiple-choice options, option B is 2.32, which is close to 2.25 * 1.075, but I don't know where that comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the (T1/T2)^4 factor.

Wait, let me compute 1.0235^4 more accurately.

1.0235^2 = ?

Compute 1.0235 * 1.0235:

= (1 + 0.02) * (1 + 0.0235) → no, better to compute directly.

1.0235 * 1.0235:

= 1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0235 = 0.0235

0.0235 * 1 = 0.0235

0.0235 * 0.0235 ≈ 0.000552.

Add: 1 + 0.0235 + 0.0235 + 0.000552 ≈ 1.047552.

So, 1.0235^2 ≈ 1.047552.

Now, square that: 1.047552^2.

Compute:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.047552 = 0.047552.

0.047552 * 1 = 0.047552.

0.047552 * 0.047552 ≈ 0.002261.

Adding up: 1 + 0.047552 + 0.047552 + 0.002261 ≈ 1.100365.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps I should compute 1.047552 * 1.047552 properly.

= (1.04 + 0.007552) * (1.04 + 0.007552)

= 1.04^2 + 2*(1.04)*(0.007552) + (0.007552)^2.

1.04^2 = 1.0816.

2*1.04*0.007552 = 2 * 0.00785968 ≈ 0.01571936.

0.007552^2 ≈ 0.00005703.

Adding: 1.0816 + 0.01571936 = 1.09731936 + 0.00005703 ≈ 1.09737639.

So, 1.0235^4 ≈ 1.097376.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.097376 ≈ 2.25 * 1.097376.

Compute 2 * 1.097376 = 2.194752.

0.25 * 1.097376 = 0.274344.

Total is 2.194752 + 0.274344 = 2.469096.

So, about 2.469.

Which is approximately 2.47.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the Doppler shift because the velocities are small, and the ratio is 2.25, option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the observed flux is affected by Doppler, but the luminosity is calculated based on the observed flux, which would involve a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the flux received from each star is F = L / (4π d²), where d is distance.

But the problem doesn't mention distance, so perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux is F = σ T^4 (R^2 / d^2) * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, which would be F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps when a star is moving towards us, the flux increases due to the Doppler effect.

The flux from a star without Doppler is F = L / (4π d²).

When the star is moving towards us at velocity v, the flux is F' = F * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But for small v, the relativistic factor sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1, so F' ≈ F (1 + v/c).

But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, the Doppler factor for flux is (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For small v, this approximates to (1 + v/c) (1 + v²/(2 c²)), but for v << c, this is roughly (1 + v/c).

But again, without knowing the distance, I can't see how this would affect the luminosity ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the luminosity ratio to be (R1^2 T1^4)/(R2^2 T2^4) = (2.25) * (T1^4)/(T2^4).

But since T1 = T2 due to same observed λ_max, the ratio is 2.25.

But then why the velocities are given?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, as it's a small effect, and the answer is 2.25, option A.

Given the options, and the fact that option A is 2.25, which is the straightforward case, I think the intended answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times larger. The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s. The goal is to compute the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:
   - The observed peak wavelengths (λ_max) for both stars are the same. According to Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature \( T \) of the star. This implies that the intrinsic temperatures of the stars are related by the Doppler shift due to Star_2's motion.
   - For Star_2, the observed wavelength is blueshifted due to its radial velocity (\( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)). The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
     \]
     Rearranging, the rest wavelength of Star_2 is:
     \[
     \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
     Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} \)), the rest wavelength of Star_2 is longer than that of Star_1. This implies that the temperature of Star_2 is slightly lower than that of Star_1:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
     \]

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     For the two stars, the luminosity ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}} \), the ratio becomes:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]

3. **Numerical Calculations**:
   - The velocity of Star_2 is \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 7 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus, \( v/c = 0.002333 \).
   - The Doppler factor for temperature is:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.023333}{0.976667}} \approx 1.0235
     \]
     Raising this to the fourth power:
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (1.0235)^4 \approx 1.0978
     \]
   - The radius ratio squared is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
     \]
   - Combining these:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 1.0978 \approx 2.47
     \]

4. **Options and Final Answer**:
   - The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately \( 2.47 \), but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is \( 2.32 \) (Option B). However, if the Doppler shift is ignored (a common approximation for small velocities), the luminosity ratio simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
     \]
     which corresponds to Option A.

Given the inclusion of radial velocities in the problem, the intended solution likely accounts for the Doppler shift, making the correct answer **Option B (~2.32)**. However, if the Doppler shift is neglected, the answer would be **Option A (~2.25)**.
