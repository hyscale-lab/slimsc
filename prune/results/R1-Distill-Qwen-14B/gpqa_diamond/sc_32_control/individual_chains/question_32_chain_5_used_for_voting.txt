Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let me think through this.

The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The common isotope is Li-7, right? Because Li has 3 protons, so Li-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Wait, wait, the problem says X has 3 neutrons. Oh, okay, that means it's Li-6. Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6, so Li-6. So the mass of the nucleus would be the mass of Li-6.

But wait, when we're dealing with high-energy physics, particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, so relativistic effects are important. The energy here is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus.

I remember that the total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to find gamma for v = 0.96c.

Let me compute gamma. So v is 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². Let's compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is... Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So the square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. Therefore, gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714... Hmm, wait, 1/0.28 is 3.5714286 approximately.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check that calculation. Let me compute 0.28^2: 0.28 * 0.28. 0.2 * 0.2 is 0.04, 0.2 * 0.08 is 0.016, 0.08 * 0.2 is another 0.016, and 0.08 * 0.08 is 0.0064. Adding them up: 0.04 + 0.016 + 0.016 + 0.0064 = 0.0784. Yep, that's correct.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857. Let's keep more decimals to be precise. 1 divided by 0.28 is 3.5714285714...

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. Since it's Li-6, I should find its atomic mass. The atomic number of lithium is 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So the mass is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Or wait, perhaps to get the nucleus mass, it's better to use the atomic mass including electrons. Hmm, but in high-energy physics, sometimes we use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, but I might need to be careful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. But since I can't do that right now, perhaps I can approximate it. Let's see. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So each proton is approximately 938 MeV, each neutron about 939.565.

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass m0 = 3*(938) + 3*(939.565) MeV/c².

Wait, let's compute that. 3*(938) = 2814 MeV. 3*(939.565) is 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. So total m0 is 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. Oh, wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, that's 5632.695 MeV, which is 5.632695 GeV.

Wait, but that might not be accurate because the nucleus's mass is a bit less than the sum of individual nucleon masses due to binding energy, but in high-energy physics, sometimes they approximate using the sum. Alternatively, perhaps the actual atomic mass is slightly different. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the atomic mass unit (u) and convert it into energy.

Wait, another approach: The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 u. Because the exact mass is about 6.017 atomic mass units. So let's go with that.

So m0 = 6.017 u. Now, I need to convert this into GeV/c². I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.017 u is 6.017 * 931.5 MeV/c².

Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.017 * 931.5 = approximately 15.8355 MeV. So total is 5589 + 15.8355 = 5604.8355 MeV, which is 5.6048355 GeV.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. 1 u is about 931.494 MeV/c². So 6.017 u is 6.017 * 931.494 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV. 0.017 * 931.494 = 15.8354 MeV. So total is 5588.964 + 15.8354 = 5604.8 MeV, which is 5.6048 GeV.

So m0 = 5.6048 GeV/c².

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c². Since we are working in units where c=1 (or, in these energy terms, E is given in GeV, and m0 is in GeV/c², so E = gamma * m0).

So E = gamma * m0 = 3.5714286 * 5.6048 GeV.

Hmm, let's compute that. 3.5714 * 5.6048.

Let me think step by step. 3 *5.6048 is 16.8144, 0.5714 *5.6048.

Compute 0.5 *5.6048 = 2.8024, 0.0714 *5.6048 ≈ 0.4025.

So 2.8024 + 0.4025 ≈ 3.2049.

So total is 16.8144 + 3.2049 ≈ 20.0193 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 3.5714286 * 5.6048.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.5714286 *5.6048.

Let's compute 5.6048 *3.5714286.

I can write 3.5714286 as 25/7 (since 25/7 ≈3.57142857). So 25/7 *5.6048.

25 *5.6048 = let's compute that. 5 *25 =125, 0.6048 *25=15.12, so total 125 +15.12=140.12.

Wait, no. Wait, 5.6048 is a single number. Wait, perhaps I should compute it properly.

Wait, 5.6048 *25 = 5.6048 *20 = 112.096, plus 5.6048 *5 = 28.024. So total 112.096 +28.024=140.12.

Now, divide by 7: 140.12 /7 = approximately 20.017 GeV.

Wait, 7*20=140, so 140.12 is just a bit more, so 20.01714 GeV.

So about 20.017 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Yes, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternative approach: The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the same as the mass of the atom minus the electrons.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 atomic mass units.

Wait, but the nucleus would have a mass slightly less than the atomic mass, because the atomic mass includes electrons. So to get the nucleus mass, I need to subtract the mass of the electrons.

Li has 3 electrons. So each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u.

So 3 electrons: 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass would be 6.017 u (atomic mass) minus 0.00164574 u, which is approximately 6.015354 u.

So m0 = 6.015354 u.

Convert to GeV/c²: 6.015354 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.015354 *931.494 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747 MeV.

0.000354 *931.494 ≈ 0.328 MeV.

So total: 9.31494 +4.65747 +0.328 ≈ 14.3 MeV.

So m0 in MeV is 5588.964 +14.3 = 5603.264 MeV, which is 5.603264 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714286.

So E = 3.5714286 *5.603264 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714286 *5.603264:

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach:

3 *5.603264 = 16.809792.

0.5714286 *5.603264.

0.5 *5.603264 = 2.801632.

0.0714286 *5.603264 ≈ approximately 0.4019.

So 2.801632 +0.4019 ≈ 3.2035.

So total: 16.809792 +3.2035 ≈ 20.0133 GeV.

So approximately 20.013 GeV. Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, my calculation is about 20.013 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV), but not exactly. So perhaps I made an error in some step.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is a bit different. Let's think. Maybe using a more precise value for the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach of m0 being approximately 5.604 GeV is correct, but let me compute the exact multiplication.

Gamma is 25/7 (approx 3.57142857).

So 25/7 *5.6048 GeV.

Compute 25 *5.6048 = 140.12, then divide by 7: 140.12 /7 = 20.01714 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.017 GeV.

Wait, but option C is 20.132. Hmm, that's a difference of around 0.115 GeV. That's about 115 MeV, which is significant. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using precise numbers.

Let me get the exact mass of Li-6. I think the exact value is 6.0171166 u.

So m0 (atomic mass) is 6.0171166 u.

But wait, the nucleus mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons. So for Li, which has 3 electrons, the nucleus mass is 6.0171166 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u.

So 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass = 6.0171166 - 0.00164574 = 6.01547086 u.

Convert to MeV/c²: 6.01547086 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute that: 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01547086 *931.494 ≈ Let's compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.00047086 *931.494: 0.0004 *931=0.3724, 0.00007086 *931≈0.0659. So total about 0.3724+0.0659=0.4383.

So adding those: 9.31494 +4.65747 =13.97241, plus 0.4383 =14.41071 MeV.

Total m0 is 5588.964 +14.41071 =5603.3747 MeV, which is 5.6033747 GeV.

Now, compute gamma * m0: 3.57142857 *5.6033747.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6033747 = ?

Multiplying 3.57142857 by 5.6033747.

Let me compute it step by step:

5.6033747 *3 =16.8101241

5.6033747 *0.5 =2.80168735

5.6033747 *0.07142857 ≈ ?

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 5.6033747 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.6033747 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

3.57142857 = 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

So:

3 *5.6033747 =16.8101241.

0.5 *5.6033747 =2.80168735.

0.07142857 *5.6033747 ≈ Let's compute this:

0.07 *5.6033747 =0.392236229.

0.00142857 *5.6033747 ≈ approximately 0.0079999.

So total ≈0.392236229 + 0.0079999 ≈0.400236.

So sum all parts: 16.8101241 +2.80168735 =19.61181145 +0.400236 ≈20.012047.

So total E ≈20.012047 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but that's 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rest mass. Maybe I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, including binding energy, which is a bit lower than the sum of individual nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus's rest mass is considered as the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons, ignoring binding energy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons, without accounting for binding energy.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron about 939.565 MeV/c².

So m0 = 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Now, compute E = gamma * m0 = 3.5714286 *5.633511 GeV.

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5714286 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.0714286 *5.633511 ≈ 0.40405.

So 2.8167555 +0.40405 ≈3.2208.

Total E ≈16.900533 +3.2208 ≈20.1213 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.1213 GeV, which is very close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects this approach, considering the sum of the individual masses of protons and neutrons, without considering binding energy.

So in that case, the correct energy would be approximately 20.121 GeV, which rounds to 20.121 GeV, and option C is 20.132 GeV, which is the closest.

Wait, let me recompute the precise calculation.

Using m0 =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute it step by step.

Multiplying 3.57142857 *5.633511:

Compute 3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857 ≈ approximately 0.00804 (because 5.633511 *0.001 is 0.005633511, and 0.00042857 is about 0.0023845. Wait, 0.00142857 is 1/700, so 5.633511 /700 ≈0.008047873.

So 0.39434577 +0.008047873 ≈0.4023936.

So 2.8167555 +0.4023936 ≈3.219149.

So E =16.900533 +3.219149 ≈20.11968 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for precise multiplication.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me use the exact value.

3.57142857 ×5.633511.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

So:

3 ×5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5 ×5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 ×5.633511 = let's compute precisely.

0.07 ×5.633511 =0.39434577.

0.00142857 ×5.633511 ≈ 5.633511 * 0.00142857.

Compute 5.633511 * 0.001 =0.005633511.

5.633511 * 0.00042857 ≈ approximately 0.0024075.

So total 0.005633511 +0.0024075 ≈0.008041011.

So the 0.07142857 ×5.633511 is 0.39434577 +0.008041011 ≈0.40238678.

So the total of 0.5 and 0.07142857 parts is 2.8167555 +0.40238678 ≈3.21914228.

Adding to the 3× part: 16.900533 +3.21914228 ≈20.119675 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options again:

C) 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, that's a bit higher. So my calculation is about 20.1197 GeV, which is 0.0123 GeV less than option C.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of the mass is different. Let me think again. Maybe using more precise numbers for the proton and neutron masses.

Proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: 939.565 MeV/c².

So Li-6: 3 protons (3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV), 3 neutrons (3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV).

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 is 0.9216.

1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So no mistake there.

So E =3.5714285714 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.5714285714 ×5.633511.

Let me write this as 3.5714285714 ×5.633511.

Compute this using a calculator-like approach.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.633511.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write 5.633511 as 5 +0.6 +0.03 +0.003511.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 3.5714285714 ×5.633511.

Let me compute it as (3.5714285714 ×5) + (3.5714285714 ×0.633511).

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.633511 = ?

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.1428571428.

3.5714285714 ×0.033511 = ?

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.03 =0.1071428571.

3.5714285714 ×0.003511 = approximately 0.0125321429.

So total for 3.5714285714 ×0.033511 is 0.1071428571 +0.0125321429 ≈0.119675.

So 3.5714285714 ×0.633511 =2.1428571428 +0.119675 ≈2.262532.

So total E =17.857142857 +2.262532 ≈20.119674 GeV.

So about 20.11967 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.0123 GeV higher than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I should consider the mass as the atomic mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which includes binding energy, but perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass is the sum of the individual nucleons. So I did that, and the calculation comes to about 20.12 GeV, but the option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the precise calculation requires more decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * m0 to more decimal places.

Gamma is exactly 25/7, which is 3.571428571428571...

m0 is 5.633511 GeV.

So 25/7 * 5.633511 = (25 *5.633511)/7.

Compute 25 *5.633511 =140.837775.

Then divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 =20.11968214 GeV.

So ≈20.1197 GeV.

Hmm, so the exact value is 20.1197 GeV. The options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So 20.1197 is very close to option C (20.132 GeV), but it's a bit lower. The difference is about 0.0123 GeV, which is approximately 12 MeV. Hmm, perhaps the options have some rounding. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as the mass of the atom, not the nucleus. So including electrons.

In that case, the mass would be 6.017 u, which is 6.017 *931.494 MeV = about 5603.3747 MeV, as I computed earlier.

So E = gamma * m0 =3.57142857 *5.6033747 GeV.

Which is about 20.012 GeV.

So that's lower than option C.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the sum of individual protons and neutrons, regardless of binding energy, leading to 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. Wait, the options show 20.132 GeV as option C. So perhaps the precise calculation with more decimal places would bring it to that.

Wait, perhaps I can compute E more precisely.

Let me compute gamma*m0 again.

Gamma =25/7 =3.571428571428571...

m0 =5.633511 GeV.

E= (25/7) *5.633511.

So 25 *5.633511=140.837775.

Divide by7: 140.837775 /7.

Let me compute this division precisely.

7 into 140.837775.

7×20=140 → 20, remainder 0.837775.

7 into 837775 → 7×119=833, so 119. So 0.837775 → 0.11968214...

So 20.11968214 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

If the problem expects four decimal places, 20.1197 is 20.1197 GeV, which would be 20.1197, perhaps rounded to 20.120 GeV. But the options only have four significant figures.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's 0.0123 GeV higher than my calculation. That's about 12.3 MeV. Is that possible due to more precise mass values?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, but perhaps the neutron mass is slightly different. Let me check.

Wait, the neutron mass is approximately 939.56543 MeV/c². So 3×939.56543 =2818.6963 MeV.

Protons: 3×938.272 MeV =2814.816 MeV.

Total: 2818.6963 +2814.816 =5633.5123 MeV =5.6335123 GeV.

So perhaps that's a tiny difference. So E=3.57142857 *5.6335123 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6335123.

Again, 3.57142857 ×5.6335123.

Compute 3 ×5.6335123 =16.9005369.

0.57142857 ×5.6335123 = ?

0.5 ×5.6335123 =2.81675615.

0.07142857 ×5.6335123 = approximately 0.40238678.

So 2.81675615 +0.40238678 =3.21914293.

So total E=16.9005369 +3.21914293 =20.1196798 GeV.

Which is 20.1197 GeV.

So, again, 20.1197 GeV. So the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but it's a bit off. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula but with the rest mass in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a Li nucleus as the sum of the individual particles without considering binding, leading to a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. Oh, option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher than my calculation, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy (K) instead of the total energy (E). But no, the question says 'the energy of the RHIC', which would be the total energy, not just kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the energy should be in GeV. The m0 is in GeV/c², gamma is unitless, so E is in GeV. So that part is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula in terms of momentum and mass, but since the problem gives speed, using gamma is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV. Given that my calculation is about 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.1197, perhaps the options are rounded, and the correct choice is C.

Wait, but the problem says the precision is 1e-4, which is four decimal places. So let's compute to four decimal places.

E=20.1196798 GeV → 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at option C: 20.132 GeV. That's 20.1320 GeV.

Difference is about 0.0123 GeV, which is 12.3 MeV. That's a pretty big difference, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the nucleus mass is wrong. Maybe the problem doesn't consider the electrons, and the mass is already the nucleus mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, let me look up the exact mass of Li-6. I think the exact value is around 6.0151 amu.

Wait, I found that the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151499 u.

So m0 (nucleus) =6.0151499 u - 3 *0.00054858 u =6.0151499 -0.00164574 =6.01350416 u.

Convert to GeV: 6.01350416 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01350416 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.00350416 *931.494 ≈ Let's compute:

0.003 *931.494 =2.794482.

0.00050416 *931.494 ≈0.4685.

So total ≈2.794482 +0.4685 ≈3.263 MeV.

So total m0 =5588.964 +9.31494 +3.263 ≈5601.54194 MeV =5.60154194 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m0 =3.57142857 *5.60154194 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.60154194.

3 *5.60154194 =16.8046258.

0.57142857 *5.60154194.

0.5 *5.60154194 =2.80077097.

0.07142857 *5.60154194 ≈ Let's compute:

0.07 *5.60154194 =0.392107936.

0.00142857 *5.60154194 ≈0.00799999.

So total ≈0.392107936 +0.00799999 ≈0.400107926.

So sum of 0.5 and 0.07142857 parts: 2.80077097 +0.400107926 ≈3.2008789.

Total E =16.8046258 +3.2008789 ≈20.0055047 GeV.

So about 20.0055 GeV.

That's even lower than before. So perhaps this approach brings us closer to option C.

Wait, but wait, this approach subtracts the electrons, so the nucleus mass is 6.01350416 u, leading to m0=5.60154194 GeV. Then E=20.0055 GeV, which is close to option A, but option A is 18.475 GeV, which is lower.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy, leading to 20.12 GeV, and the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation of gamma again.

Wait, wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in MeV, but I'm using GeV. No, I think I'm consistent with units.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given that my most accurate calculation using the sum of protons and neutrons gives E≈20.1197 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV), I'll go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a Li-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. Since energy is expressed in GeV and \( m_0 \) is in GeV/c², the calculation simplifies to \( E = \gamma m_0 \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \) as follows:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus
Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate proton and neutron masses:
\[
m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2, \quad m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
\]
The total rest mass of the nucleus is:
\[
m_0 = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \), which is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy may arise from rounding or slight variations in the input values.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
