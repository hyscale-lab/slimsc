Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The more massive the planet, the bigger the shift, right? But wait, the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are the same.

The stars are similar to the Sun, same mass, so their masses are the same. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things because eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The question gives the shift in spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the planet's orbital period?

Oh, right! The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 + (M_p / M_star))^(2/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's more complicated than I need. Alternatively, I think the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since both planets have the same mass and same star mass, and circular orbits (so e=0, so denominator is 1), the K would be proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * something else. Wait, maybe I should think of the relation between K and P.

Wait, let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should write the formula correctly. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Sun-like star, Neptune mass planet), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So simplifying:

K ≈ [ (G P )/(2 π c) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but we can rearrange this formula to solve for P in terms of K. Let's see:

K = constant * (1 / P^(1/3)) * M_p / M_star^(2/3)

Wait, wait, let me rearrange:

K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3) )^{-1}, because:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let's see:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p,1 / M_star^(2/3) / P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p,2 / M_star^(2/3) / P2^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p,1 = M_p,2 and M_star is same, this ratio becomes (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, but if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So 0.714 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So cube both sides: (0.714)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait 0.714 is approximately 5/7, yeah. So (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So that's P2 / P1.

If P2/P1 is about 0.364, that means P2 is about 0.364 times P1, so planet #2's period is shorter. Wait, but the options are about how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then it's shorter, so P2 is about 0.36 times longer? Or wait, wait, because the question is phrased as "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is longer, it's a number greater than 1. If P2 is shorter, the number is less than 1.

But wait, according to our calculation, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check.

Alternative approach: The RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * [ (2π)/(c P) ) ]^(1/3 )

But again, simplifying as before, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So K1 = k * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

K2 = k * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

Taking the ratio: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So rearranged: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait wait, no: K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let me write it step by step.

From K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), we have K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1 )

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, wait, if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet #1 and K2 for planet #2, then:

If K1 is smaller than K2, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1? Because a smaller K1 would mean a longer period.

Wait, let me think. A larger K means a bigger Doppler shift, which would imply a larger velocity. So a larger velocity would imply a shorter orbital period, because the star is moving more quickly, so the planet is orbiting closer, leading to a shorter period.

Wait, but wait. The formula says K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so K is larger when P is smaller.

So if planet #1 has K1 =5, and planet #2 K2=7, then K2 is larger than K1. So P2 must be smaller than P1. Because as K increases, P decreases.

So P2 is smaller than P1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It can't be longer; it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So the answer would be approx 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, let me calculate the exact value. K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So (K1/K2) = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = approx 0.364.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. That means planet #2's period is shorter, so the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. It's not longer, so the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given by the relationship:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both planets have the same mass and their host stars have the same mass, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is related to the ratio of their orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

The problem states that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714, \quad \left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2/P_1 \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is compared to \( P_1 \), the answer is approximately 0.36.
