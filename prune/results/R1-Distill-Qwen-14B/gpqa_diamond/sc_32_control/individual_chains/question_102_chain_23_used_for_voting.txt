Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology techniques, specifically involving transgenic mice and some sort of expression vectors. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

Alright, first, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate, so they probably want to track where these proteins end up. The setup involves some sort of vector with these genes and fluorescent markers.

The vector is bicistronic, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames). The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor ORF is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP. So, for the ligand, it's ligand-mCherry, and for the receptor, it's receptor-eGFP.

Looking at the regulatory elements: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA stands for chicken beta-actin, and I think that's a strong promoter, often used to drive high expression. Then, between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are sites used by Cre recombinase. LoxP is a 34 bp site, and lox2272 is a 33 bp site, but they're different enough that Cre can distinguish between them. So, when Cre is introduced, it can excise the stop cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and also between the receptor and eGFP.

So, the idea is probably that Cre will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed. But this depends on the presence of Cre.

Now, the experiment. They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They ran a Western blot and saw a signal proportional to actin loading, meaning the proteins are being expressed and detected.

But then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So, cre would be expressed under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They weren't seeing any green signal. Green is from eGFP. So, the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or something's wrong with its expression.

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means secreted and acts on nearby cells. If that's the case, both cells would have the receptor and ligand, but I'm not sure how that affects the expression of the construct.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck there, maybe it's not being trafficked to the membrane, so eGFP wouldn't be detectable on the surface. But why wouldn't the Western blot show it? Because Western would detect it regardless of localization, as long as it's expressed.

Wait, but in the Western, they probably used an antibody against the overexpressed proteins, which could be either the ligand or the receptor. So if the construct is not expressed, you wouldn't see a band. But they saw a signal proportional to actin, meaning the proteins were expressed. So the Western blot works, but the fluorescence doesn't.

So, if the eGFP isn't fluorescent, maybe it's not being processed correctly. Or maybe the construct isn't being expressed in the right cells.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre. So SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells. The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand. CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so the ligand should be expressed wherever the construct is active. But the IRES upstream of the receptor—so the receptor is under the control of an IRES, which probably allows for internal ribosome entry, meaning that the receptor is co-translated with the ligand, but in a different reading frame.

Wait, bicistronic vectors can work with IRES elements. So, the first ORF is under the promoter (like CBA for the ligand), and then the IRES starts the second ORF (the receptor). But this setup would require that the IRES is functional in the target cells.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by the stop cassette with loxP. Then the IRES is upstream of the receptor? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read again.

The vector is bicistronic, ligand ORF at 5' (CBA promoter), fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at 3', with eGFP at C-terminus. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, stop cassette loxP-stop-loxP. Receptor and eGFP have a lox2272 stop cassette.

Wait, so the vector is like:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette (loxP) -> mCherry.

Then, for the second ORF: IRES upstream of the receptor, then receptor ORF, then stop cassette (lox2272) -> eGFP.

So when Cre is introduced, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be in frame, and the receptor and eGFP in frame.

In the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. But with Cre, the stops are removed, so the ligand is expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

In the mouse model, the construct is in a transgenic line, probably under control of a certain promoter. The presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre) should excise the stops, leading to expression of both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the offspring, they don't see green (eGFP). So the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

Why? Let's think about the possibilities.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, then the receptor would be truncated or not expressed. But if the Cre was active, the stop should have been excised. So perhaps the Cre wasn't active, but why?

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which is where the ligand and receptor are initially expressed. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active in neural crest-derived cells, which includes some lineages like astrocytes perhaps.

But wait, the construct is in the mouse's genome. The loxP and lox2272 sites are present in the vector. Cre recombinase will recognize these sites and excise the stop cassettes. So, in the presence of Cre (from the SOX10-Cre mice), the stops should be gone, allowing the expression of the ligand and receptor with their respective fluorescent proteins.

But the offspring's eGFP isn't visible. So maybe the Cre wasn't active, meaning the stop wasn't excised. But why? Because the Cre expression wasn't sufficient, or the cells where Cre is active aren't the ones being looked at.

Wait, the construct is in the mouse, and the Cre is from SOX10, which is active in neural crest. So maybe the eGFP is expressed only in neural crest-derived cells, but the mice were perhaps not properly expressing Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct was not correctly excised. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, if the stop cassette wasn't excised, the receptor would be terminated, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if Cre is active, the stop should be removed.

But what if the vector has the IRES between the ligand and the receptor? Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. The vector is CBA promoter driving ligand, then stop cassette, then mCherry. Then, the receptor is after IRES, followed by stop cassette and eGFP.

Wait, the IRES is a way to allow the second ORF (receptor) to be translated without a second promoter. So, the ligand is under CBA, then the IRES initiates the receptor's translation.

But in the absence of Cre, the mCherry and eGFP are not expressed because of the stop cassettes. So in the transgenic mice, without Cre, the mice would express the ligand and receptor, but not the fluorescent proteins.

But when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the problem says that Western blot shows the proteins (ligand and receptor) are expressed. So the construct is working at that level. But when looking for eGFP, there's nothing.

So maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised. Why?

If the construct wasn't properly recombined, perhaps because the Cre wasn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous line. SOX10-Cre would be active in the neural crest cells. So if the construct is expressed in the same cells, the Cre would be present and active, leading to excision.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised. But then why?

Wait, perhaps the lox sites are incorrect. The stop cassette after the ligand is loxP, and the stop after receptor is lox2272. Cre recognizes loxP sites, but can it recognize lox2272?

No, wait, lox2272 is a mutant site that Cre can't cut. Wait, no, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site that can be recognized by Cre. Wait, no. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, maybe lox2272 requires a different Cre variant, like Dre or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site is a 'floxed' site that Cre can cut, but not as efficiently as loxP.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. I think that loxP is the standard site, and lox2272 is a variant that has a different sequence. Some Cre variants can recognize both, but standard Cre might have trouble with lox2272.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is a 'false' site that Cre can't cut. Or maybe it's a site that requires Cre with a different specificity.

Wait, no. I think that both loxP and lox2272 are recognized by Cre, but I'm not entirely sure. If the vector has loxP and lox2272, and the Cre used can only cut one of them, then only one of the stop cassettes would be excised.

Wait, the construct has:

Ligand ORF -> loxP stop -> mCherry.

Receptor ORF -> lox2272 stop -> eGFP.

So, when Cre is introduced, it can cut both loxP and lox2272. But if the Cre can't cut lox2272, then only the loxP stop is excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the eGFP stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says that after crossing with SOX10-Cre, they don't see eGFP. So perhaps the Cre in the SOX10-Cre line can't recognize the lox2272 site, so the stop cassette after the receptor isn't excised. That would mean the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the lox2272 is the stop cassette for the eGFP. So if that stop is not excised, the eGFP would not be expressed. So in the Western, the receptor would be detected because the ligand is under CBA, and the IRES allows for receptor expression. But in the fluorescence, only mCherry would be present, not eGFP.

But in the question, the eGFP is not observed. So which lox site is the issue?

Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272 as the stop cassettes for mCherry and eGFP, respectively. Cre might not cut lox2272 as efficiently as loxP. If that's the case, the lox2272 stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would the eGFP stop not be excised? If the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then only the loxP stop would be cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed.

But the problem says that they used SOX10-Cre. Wait, I'm not sure if the Cre in the SOX10-Cre line can process both loxP and lox2272 sites. If the Cre can't process lox2272, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct wasn't correctly recombined because the loxP and lox2272 sites are in the same orientation or not flanking the stop cassette correctly.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES element. The IRES is used to drive the receptor's expression. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed.

But in the Western, they saw the proteins, so the ligand and receptor are expressed. So the IRES must be functional.

Wait, but in the Western, they're using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the ligand and receptor are expressed, then the vector is working, but the eGFP isn't.

So, the only problem is the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop wasn't excised, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the receptor would be truncated. But the Western blot shows the receptor is expressed, so that's not it.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. But the Western blot would detect it regardless of where it is in the cell, as long as it's expressed. So if it's stuck in the Golgi, the blot would still show it, just maybe not properly localized for fluorescence.

But the problem says that the Western shows a signal, so the proteins are expressed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because of a stop codon in the construct. But why would the Western blot detect the receptor? Because the Western is using an antibody against the overexpressed proteins—either ligand or receptor.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised. So, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not. But in the Western, the antibody would detect the receptor, regardless of eGFP.

But why isn't the stop cassette being excised?

Maybe the Cre isn't active. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest cells where the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is in a region of the genome that's not active in the cells of interest. Or, perhaps the Cre is not properly expressed, maybe due to a wrong promoter or something.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is constitutively active. So probably, the enhancer isn't the issue.

Option A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means that cells produce the ligand and the receptor is on adjacent cells. But I don't see how this affects the expression of the fluorescent markers.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, and that stop isn't excised. The reason could be that the Cre wasn't able to cut the lox2272 site.

Wait, I'm pretty sure that the lox2272 is a variant of loxP that can be cut by Cre, but perhaps with lower efficiency. But in the setup, the vector has loxP for the ligand's stop and lox2272 for the receptor's stop. So when Cre is introduced, it should cut both.

But if the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, then only the loxP stop is cut, leading to expression of mCherry but not eGFP.

Wait, but in the question, the eGFP isn't observed. So if the lox2272 site wasn't cut, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the Cre is in the wrong orientation relative to the lox sites. But in that case, both stops would remain.

Wait, perhaps the vector design is such that the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor only after the stop is excised. So if the stop remains, then the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

So the issue is that the eGFP's stop wasn't excised, so it's not expressed.

But why?

If the Cre didn't excise the lox2272 stop. So perhaps the SOX10-Cre doesn't function properly with the lox2272 sites.

Alternatively, think about the vector's setup. The vector has two cassettes: one with loxP and one with lox2272. Both need to be excised for both fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

If the Cre can't excise lox2272, then the eGFP won't be expressed, but the mCherry would. But the question says they don't see any green signal. Maybe in the offspring, mCherry is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the question says they're looking for green signal, which is eGFP. So the problem is that eGFP isn't expressed.

So, if the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP wasn't excised, that's why eGFP isn't expressed. So why wasn't it excised?

If the Cre can't cut lox2272. But if the Cre can't cut it, then that's the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site is in a different orientation, so Cre can't cut.

Wait, in the vector, the lox sites must be in the correct orientation for Cre to excise the stop. If they are in the same direction, the stop will be excised. If in opposite, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a forward and a reverse lox site, or something like that, making it difficult.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mouse's genotype is homozygous for the construct, so in the offspring, they're homozygous for the construct and hemizygous for SOX10-Cre. Wait, but SOX10-Cre is a transgene, so perhaps it's not expressed in the right cells.

Wait, but the construct is in the mouse's genome, and the Cre is in another transgene. So when they have the SOX10-Cre, the Cre would be expressed under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

But if the construct is expressed in a different cell type, maybe the Cre isn't active in those cells, so the stop isn't excised.

Wait, but the question states that the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells, so the construct should be active in those cells, which also express Cre. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame. If the stop wasn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if the stop was excised, but the reading frame is off, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would make option D correct.

Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So, when the stop is excised, are the ORFs correctly in frame?

The vector would have the receptor ORF followed by the eGFP ORF, but in the same frame. If the stop is in between, and the stop is excised, then the two ORFs would be in frame.

But if the vector was designed incorrectly, maybe the frames are different. For example, if the stop is followed by eGFP in a different frame, then when the stop is excised, the receptor is in frame, but the eGFP is out of frame, leading to a frameshift. So eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But then, the Western blot would detect the receptor, but the eGFP isn't made. So that's consistent with the results.

So which option is this? It would be option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop isn't excised, which could be due to the lox2272 not being cut. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another thought: the vector uses different lox sites for each stop cassette, but Cre can only recognize one of them. So if the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop between the receptor and eGFP isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. But then why is the ligand's stop (loxP) cut?

So in the ligand's case, the stop is loxP, which Cre can cut, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So in this scenario, it's because the lox2272 site isn't cut.

But I don't think that's one of the options. The options don't mention anything about the lox sites.

So looking back at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that even if the stop is excised, they're not correctly in frame, so eGFP isn't made.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because the stop isn't excised, but the Western blot shows the receptor is expressed, so the stop must have been excised.

Wait, the Western blot uses an antibody against the overexpressed proteins, which could be the ligand or the receptor. If the ligand is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, and the receptor is expressed, then perhaps the stop was excised correctly. So the problem is elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility is that the eGFP is not being properly processed, maybe due to a mutation or a stop codon. But the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent for some reason, like improper folding. But the question says they don't see any green signal, implying it's not expressed.

Hmm.

Let me try to summarize:

The vector is designed so that when Cre is present, the two stop cassettes are excised, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed along with the ligand and receptor.

In the experiment, the Western blot shows that the ligand and receptor are expressed, so the stop cassettes must have been excised. But the eGFP isn't expressed, which is puzzling.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is at 5', followed by mCherry, but the stop is in between. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', followed by eGFP with its own stop. So when the stop is excised, the ligand is followed by mCherry, and the receptor is followed by eGFP.

So if both stops are excised, both fluorescent proteins should be expressed. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, maybe the excision didn't happen for that particular stop.

But the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed. So perhaps the issue is with the eGFP construct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the eGFP is not being correctly cloned into the vector. Like, perhaps it's in the wrong orientation. So when the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't in the correct reading frame, leading to no expression.

So that would be option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame but the cloning introduced a frameshift, making it non-functional.

But how would that happen? The vector should have been designed so that the eGFP is in frame with the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is cloned in the reverse direction, leading to no expression.

Wait, but the question says that the vector has the ligand ORF at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at 3' fused to eGFP. So the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor.

So the construct should be: Receptor-eGFP.

So when the stop is excised, Receptor is expressed and eGFP is at the end.

If the stop is excised, but the reading frame isn't correct, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So that would be option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop wasn't excised, but the Western blot should show that the receptor isn't expressed. But since the Western shows it's expressed, that can't be.

Wait, the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which are the ligand and receptor. So if the ligand and receptor are expressed, but eGFP isn't, the problem is not with their expression, but with eGFP.

So the possible conclusions are:

If the stop was excised, but eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame. So the construct is not in frame, making option D correct.

Alternatively, if the stop wasn't excised, but the Western shows the receptor is expressed, that can't be. So the stop must have been excised.

Therefore, the issue must be that the eGFP is not in frame. So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent markers (mCherry and eGFP) under specific stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272). The vector is designed to allow Cre recombinase to excise these stop cassettes, enabling co-expression of the fluorescent proteins with the ligand and receptor. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre mice, which should excise the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy, while Western blot confirms expression of the ligand and receptor.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies the ligand acts on nearby cells, but this does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The issue lies in the construct's expression, not the ligand-receptor interaction. This option is irrelevant.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be expressed and detectable on Western blot. Since the Western blot shows receptor expression but no eGFP fluorescence, this is unlikely. The problem is not with trafficking but with eGFP expression.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES. These regulatory elements ensure expression in the absence of tissue-specific enhancers. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The vector design allows for co-expression of the receptor and eGFP only if the stop cassette is excised and the reading frame is preserved. If the stop cassette was excised but the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame, it would not be expressed. This aligns with the observation that the receptor is expressed (detected by Western blot) but eGFP is not fluorescent. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of eGFP fluorescence is due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the correct reading frame, preventing eGFP expression despite the stop cassette being excised. 

ANSWER: D
