Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5, right? Or mathematically, N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. So, if something is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, parallax is smaller. The formula I know is distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by parallax (d ≈ 1/plx). So plx and d are inversely proportional.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of d instead of plx. Let me write down the relationships.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, plx = 1/d → plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes d^5.

So N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. If plx is 1/d, then plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That would mean the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, wait, the options are given as functions of r, but I think r here refers to distance. So perhaps the change is in terms of r, which is distance.

Wait, but the problem says "how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r?)" So maybe it's about the differential, like the number of stars per unit distance. Because if you're talking about the number of stars in a region, when you move to a larger distance, the number could be increasing in a certain way.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And since plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases with d^5. But wait, that can't be right because when you look at a larger distance, how many more stars are there? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if I have a larger distance, the parallax is smaller. So for a given region, the number of stars is proportional to (distance)^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5, which seems like a lot. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because I thought the number of stars decreases with distance because they're farther away and their light is dimmer. Or maybe in this case, the number increases because of some other factor.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up flux and number counts. So the flux (apparent brightness) of a star decreases with distance squared. But the number counts might increase if there are more stars at greater distances, but that depends on the distribution of stars.

But in this problem, it's given that N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is the same as N ∝ d^5. So, for a given region, as you go farther away, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. But wait, how? Let me think about the units or the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the formula is about the number density. Like, for a given volume, how many stars are there. If the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, that suggests that the number density increases rapidly with distance, which might not make sense because you'd expect the number of stars to decrease with distance as you look into the cosmos. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that more stars are found at larger distances because they're more abundant, but that doesn't align with typical observations. But the question gives this specific relationship, so I shouldn't get stuck on real-world expectations.

So another approach: Since N ∝ 1/plx^5 and plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So for each unit increase in distance, the number of stars increases by a factor of d^5. So the number of stars as a function of distance is growing rapidly with d. But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. Wait, perhaps I'm being asked about the differential change, like dN/dr, the rate of change of N with respect to r (distance).

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So, it's about the change per unit distance, which would be the derivative dN/dr. But N is proportional to d^5, so dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to d^4.

Wait, wait. Let me think in terms of integration. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell (4πd² dr) multiplied by the number density (stars per unit volume). If the number density is n, then the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dr.

But in our case, the number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5 = d^5. Wait, that might not be the same as number density. Because N is the total number, not the number per volume. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up total number and number density.

Wait, wait, perhaps the setup is that the number of stars in a certain region (like a slice of the sky) is given as proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So maybe the region is a volume element.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which would be d^5. But that doesn't make sense because number density shouldn't depend on distance in such a way.

Wait, maybe the question is considering a specific area in the sky and looking at how the number of stars varies with distance. So the number of stars in a given line of sight (i.e., along a particular direction) increases with distance in the manner of 1/plx^5.

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to how the number of galaxies you see increases with distance, but that's another topic. But in this case, it's stars, and the relation is given. So maybe the number of stars N in that region is proportional to d^5.

So for a small change in distance dr, the change in N would be dN = 5 d^4 dr. So dN/dr = 5 d^4, which implies that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance per unit distance.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r. So for each unit of r, how does N change? So if N is proportional to r^5, then the derivative dN/dr is 5 r^4, meaning the change per unit r is proportional to r^4.

But let's think about the options again. The options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars change with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power. So as you move from distance d to d + dr, the number of stars increases by a factor of (d+dr)^5 - d^5, which for small dr is approximately 5 d^4 dr. So the change in N per unit change in d is proportional to d^4. So per unit distance, the change is about r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So per unit distance, the change in N is proportional to r^4. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Alternatively, another approach: think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and distance d in parsecs is 1/plx. So plx = 1/d. So plx^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about how N changes with r (distance). So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5. But the options include B) r^5, which would imply the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power.

Wait, but the question specifies how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's about the rate of change, which is dN/dr. Since N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So for each unit r, the number of stars increases by 5 k r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

But looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but the question isn't about the rate of change. It's about how the number "changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the wording is a bit confusing. The way I'm interpreting it is that the question is asking how the number of stars depends on distance. So if N ∝ r^5, then the answer would be B) r^5.

But wait, why would the number of stars increase with distance? That seems counterintuitive because as you look further away, each star is dimmer, but maybe there are more stars at that distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using calculus. Let me model N as a function of distance.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d → N = k * d^5, where k is the constant of proportionality.

So N = k d^5. Then, the change in N for a small change dr in distance is dN = 5k d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5k d^4.

So the change in stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4, which would mean the answer is C) ~ r^4.

But the question asks, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is (d)^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So per unit distance, it increases as d^5.

Wait, but the options are about how it changes with distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then the correct answer is B) ~ r^5. Because the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me re-examine the question.

The question states that "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ d^5.

So the number of stars increases as distance to the fifth power. So the correct answer would be B) ~ r^5.

But wait, if you have more stars as you go further, that's only possible if the density of stars increases with distance, which is not typical, but the question gives that relation.

So the answer should be B) r^5.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the derivative, I thought the change per unit distance is r^4, which would be option C. Now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the derivative dN/dr.

But the question states, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit distance, which is the rate of change, which is r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)", so perhaps it's the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4, so the change per unit r is r^4. So in that case, the answer would be option C) ~ r^4.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck between B and C. Let me think again.

The question says, "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = C * (1/plx)^5 → since plx = 1/d, N = C * d^5.

So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars in that region depends on distance as d^5. So the change is proportional to d^5. So the answer would be B) ~ r^5.

But the part that's tripping me is whether the question is about the total number or the number per unit distance.

Wait, let me read the question again carefully: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

So per unit range of distance. So it's the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the derivative.

So if N = k r^5, then the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5 kr^4, so the change is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer is C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". That might be interpreted as the change in N for each unit increase in r, which is the derivative.

So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the answer is C.

So I think the correct answer is C) ~ r^4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( dN/dr \). Starting with \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C) ~ \( r^4 \)**, as the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).
