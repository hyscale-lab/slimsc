Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. 

Let me list out the components again to make sure I have them right.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix:
First row: 0 1
Second row: 1 0

So that's like the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix:
First row: 0 -i
Second row: i 0

And Pz is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix:
First row: 1 0
Second row: 0 -1

Wait, no. Let me see the exact matrices:

Px matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Right, so P is a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary in x-z, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis perhaps, but since it's in x-z, the azimuthal angle φ is zero or something like that. Wait, no, because x-z plane would have φ=0 or π/2? Wait, no, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So the direction vector n can be represented in spherical coordinates with θ from the z-axis and φ=0 or maybe π/2? Wait, no, the x-z plane is the case where the angle φ is 0 or π. Because the x-z plane is the one where the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal φ is 0 for the x direction.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the direction is given by a unit vector n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The x-z plane would have y=0, so any point in it is (x,0,z). So the spherical angles would have φ=0. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, wait, no. Because in spherical coordinates, φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So when φ is 0, you're pointing along the x direction. When φ is π/2, you're in the y direction, but here, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ is either 0 or π. Let's say φ=0 for simplicity.

So the operator P has components along x, y, and z. But in this case, since we're looking along an arbitrary direction n in x-z, the operator we need is P·n, which is the projection of P along n. So the operator we're interested in is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So P·n = sinθ (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix. 

The first term: sinθ (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Which is [[0, sinθ ħ/2], [sinθ ħ/2, 0]]

Second term: cosθ (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Which is [[cosθ ħ/2, 0], [0, -cosθ ħ/2]]

Adding these together, the matrix P·n is:

Top left: cosθ (ħ/2)
Top right: sinθ (ħ/2)
Bottom left: sinθ (ħ/2)
Bottom right: -cosθ (ħ/2)

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

We're told that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. So λ is +ħ/2.

So construct the matrix (P·n - λ I):

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ), (-ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2) ]

Simplify each element.

Top left: (ħ/2)(cosθ - 1)
Top right: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom left: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom right: (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1 )

So the matrix is:

[ (ħ/2 (cosθ - 1)), (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ), (ħ/2 (-cosθ -1)) ]

We can factor out ħ/2 from each element, so the matrix becomes (ħ/2) times:

[ (cosθ -1 ), sinθ ]
[ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ]

Now, for this matrix to have a non-trivial solution (eigenvector), the determinant must be zero.

But wait, because we're dealing with an eigenvalue equation, the determinant of (P·n - λ I) should be zero, but since we're setting λ as a known eigenvalue, perhaps we can proceed by solving for the eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write out the equations.

Let me denote the eigenvector as a 2-component vector [a; b]. Then, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) [a; b] = λ [a; b].

So substituting the matrix, we have:

( (ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b ) = (ħ/2) a
( (ħ/2 sinθ) a - (ħ/2 cosθ) b ) = (ħ/2) b

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

Equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a
Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange the equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a + ( - cosθ -1 ) b = 0

So from equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b

Let me compute the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ). So,

a = [ - sinθ / (- (1 - cosθ)) ] b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, using the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So,

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

Simplify: [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) * b

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2) * b; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

But perhaps it's easier to write in terms of b. Let me set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2). So the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So |cot(theta/2)|² + 1 = 1 → [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ] = csc²(theta/2) → sqrt(cot²(theta/2)+1) = csc(theta/2).

Wait, no. Wait, the magnitude squared is (cot^2 (theta/2) + 1) = csc²(theta/2), so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(csc²(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me compute that. Because a = cot(theta/2) * b, and b is 1. But when we normalize, the vector is (a, b) / normalization.

Wait, let me think. Let me compute the normalization factor N such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Let me set b = 1 (scaled), then a = cot(theta/2). So the magnitude squared is cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2). So the normalization factor N is 1 / sqrt(csc²(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / [sin(theta/2) ] → [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] * [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, no. Wait, [ a; b ] before normalization is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]. The normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( cot²(theta/2) + 1 ) ) = 1 / csc(theta/2) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let's compute each component.

cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor. But in this problem, the options given don't include phase factors except option B and D. So perhaps I should consider that.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is a spin-1/2 operator, so the eigenstates are spin-up or spin-down along the direction n. So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be the spin-up state along n, which, in the computational basis (eigenstates of Sz), can be written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So e^{i phi} is 1. So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But let me cross-check that. So when I set up the equations, the eigenvector came out to be proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] which, when normalized, becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Because cot(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)], and when multiplied by sin(theta/2), it gives cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in that case, when theta is 0, the direction is along z. Then the eigenvector is [1, 0], which is correct. If theta is 180 degrees (pi radians), then cos(theta/2) is 0, and sin(theta/2) is 1, so the vector becomes [0,1], which would be the spin-down state along z, but wait, wait, wait.

Wait no, when theta is pi, n is pointing along the negative z direction. So the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which would correspond to spin-up along negative z, meaning the state |down> along z. So the state would be [0,1], which matches the eigenvector when theta=pi.

Wait, but in the case of theta=pi/2, the direction is along x. Then cos(theta/2) is cos(pi/4)=√2/2, and sin(theta/2)=√2/2. So the eigenvector is [√2/2, √2/2], which is the eigenstate for Sx with eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) → but I think that's the spherical harmonics for l=1, m=0 or something. But in our case, it's a two-component spinor.

Option D is sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) → but wait, why would hbar be there? The eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, so options A and D have factors of hbar, which seems off. Because the components of the eigenvector are just complex numbers (possibly), not multiplied by ħ.

Wait, the problem statement says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the options should have dimensionless elements.

Looking at the options:

A) (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) → these have units of hbar, which is wrong for an eigenvector.

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → These are dimensionless. But earlier, the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so this doesn't match.

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → this matches our result.

D) (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) → same issue with hbar.

So the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but wait, why did the eigenvector come out as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]? Because when I did the calculation, the normalized vector was [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the direction n is (sin theta, 0, cos theta). The spin-up state along n is given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But in our case, phi is zero, so it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So yes, the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Y matrix),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by the projection $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \lambda I)|v\rangle = 0$, where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$. Subtracting $\lambda I$ from the matrix of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \lambda I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of this matrix must be zero. Solving the eigenvalue equation, the eigenvector is found to be proportional to $[\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)]$. Normalizing this vector ensures that the components satisfy the condition $|\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes factors of $\hbar$, which are dimensionally inconsistent with the eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived eigenvector, which depends on $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect factors of $\hbar$.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
