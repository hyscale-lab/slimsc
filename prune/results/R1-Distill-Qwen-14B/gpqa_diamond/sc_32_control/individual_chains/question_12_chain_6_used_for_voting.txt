Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, I remember that Pi is a pion, and mu is a muon. The problem states that the pion is stationary, which probably means it's at rest before decay. 

The rest masses are provided: the Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) has 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? I think neutrinos are really light, but in these kinds of problems, their rest mass is usually neglected. So maybe I can treat the neutrino as having zero rest mass. Or does it have a non-zero mass? I'm not sure, but for the sake of this problem, I think we can assume it's zero unless stated otherwise. Or perhaps the problem expects me to include it since it's part of the decay products.

Wait, the reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. So the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I can ignore it. Hmm, but that might affect the calculations. Let me think about the conservation laws here.

So, the pion is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum of the products must be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum (since for massless particles, E = pc).

Let me write down the known values:

Mass of Pi(+) = m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
Mass of mu(+) = m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
Mass of neutrino (nu) = 0 MeV/c² (approximated)

Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy: E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy must still be 139.6 MeV because energy is conserved. The total energy of the muon and neutrino should add up to this. But because the neutrino is (nearly) massless, its energy is much higher if it's moving quickly, but since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but how do I find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino? Oh, right, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c². For the neutrino, since m_nu is zero, KE_nu = E_nu.

But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the momentum of the muon as p, and that of the neutrino as p_nu = p, but in the opposite direction. So their magnitudes are the same, p_mu = p_nu = p.

Wait, but since the neutrino is nearly massless, its energy is E_nu = p_nu c. And for the muon, its energy would be E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the energy of a particle is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) / c^2? No, wait, units might be tricky here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work in natural units where c=1. So E = sqrt( p² + m² ). Hmm, maybe that's easier.

So, in natural units (c=1), E_pi = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, E_mu + E_nu = E_pi = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum-wise, the muon has momentum p, and the neutrino has momentum p as well, but in opposite directions. So the total momentum is zero, as required.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p (since for the neutrino, m_nu=0).

So, the sum is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, solving for p. Let me write that equation again:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

So, sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Square both sides:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranged:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

p = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / (2 m_pi )

Let me compute that.

m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

m_pi squared is (139.6)^2 ≈ let's compute that.

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

m_mu squared is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that.

105 *105 = 11025, 0.7^2=0.49. 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So, m_pi² - m_mu² =19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then, 2 m_pi is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

Approximating: 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So perhaps 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 *29.8 = ?

Wait, 279.2 * 30 is 8376. Subtract 279.2 *0.2 = 55.84 → 8376 -55.84= 8320.16. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 8315.67.

Wait, wait, 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit more than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps 29.7?

279.2 * 29.7 → 279.2 * (30 -0.3) → 8376 - (279.2 *0.3).

279.2 *0.3 = 83.76. So 8376 -83.76=8292.24.

Hmm, 8292.24 is less than 8315.67.

So 29.7 → 8292.24; 29.8 →8320.16.

Our target is 8315.67.

Difference between 29.7 and 29.8 is 0.1, which gives an increase of about 27.92 MeV (since 279.2 *0.1=27.92).

We have 8315.67 -8292.24 =23.43 MeV. So 23.43 /27.92 ≈ 0.839 of the way from 29.7 to 29.8.

So p ≈29.7 +0.0839≈ 29.7839. Approx 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units. Since we're in natural units (c=1), p is in MeV/c? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of units correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should express p in MeV/c. Because p = [m_pi² - m_mu²]/(2 m_pi) → the units would be (MeV^2)/(MeV) → MeV. So perhaps in units where c=1, p would be in MeV/c. Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, perhaps it's better to not worry about units here, as all the calculations are in MeV, so the resulting p is in MeV/c.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, let's compute E_mu and E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu^2 )

p^2 is approximately (29.78)^2 → around 886.8 MeV².

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 =11172.49 MeV².

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so E_mu is about 109.8 MeV.

E_nu = p = 29.78 MeV.

So total energy is 109.8 +29.78 ≈139.58 MeV, which is close to the initial 139.6 MeV, so that seems correct.

Now, the kinetic energy for the muon is E_mu - m_mu c² → but since in our units E_mu is in MeV, and m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu =109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

And the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu =29.78 MeV. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its total energy is all kinetic. So KE_nu is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly these numbers. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV
B)7.2, 32.8
C)3.52,20.8
D)4.12, 29.8

Wait, I got KE_mu around 4.1 MeV and KE_nu around 29.8 MeV, which matches option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

But wait, I think I approximated p as 29.78, which is 29.8. So option D's second value is 29.8.

But let me double-check the calculations to see if I made any mistake.

Wait, let me re-calculate p.

m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Compute m_pi^2: 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 =140² -2*140*0.4 +0.4²=19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16.

m_mu^2=105.7^2=105^2 +2*105*0.7 +0.7^2=11025 +147 +0.49=11172.49.

m_pi^2 - m_mu^2=19488.16 - 11172.49=8315.67.

2 m_pi=2*139.6=279.2.

So p=8315.67 /279.2 → let's compute it accurately.

Compute 279.2 × 29.78 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

I can do this division:

279.2 × 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 → minus 279.2 →8376-279.2=8096.8.

Wait, no, that's 279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

But 279.2 ×29.8= 279.2*(30 -0.2)= 8376 - (279.2 *0.2)=8376-55.84=8320.16.

Wait, but 8315.67 is a bit less than 8320.16.

So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is 4.49 larger than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps the difference is 4.49.

So 279.2 × something gives 4.49 less.

So let me compute 29.8 - (4.49/279.2) → 4.49 /279.2 is approximately 0.016.

So 29.8 -0.016=29.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

So E_mu= sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )= sqrt(887.1 +11172.49)= sqrt(12059.59)= approximately 109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu=109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

Which rounds to 4.12 MeV, matching option D's first part. The neutrino's KE is 29.784 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV, as in option D.

Wait, but wait, in the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8, so that's exactly what we have here.

But earlier when I thought about the neutrino's kinetic energy, I thought it's E_nu = p, which is correct. So the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. So that's option D.

Wait, but wait, another approach comes to mind. Let me think again. The pion is at rest, so its energy is all converted into the rest energy of the products plus their kinetic energies. So the rest energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino has negligible rest energy. So the total rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy would be 139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. But wait, that's the total KE of both particles. So the muon's KE plus the neutrino's KE equals 33.9 MeV.

In our earlier calculation, the muon's KE is ~4.1 MeV and the neutrino's is ~29.8, which sums to 33.9, which matches this.

So the initial approach seems correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as:

\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_\nu \approx 0 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay is conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon (\(E_{\mu^+}\)) and the neutrino (\(E_\nu\)):
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. The muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p.
   \]

3. **Energy-Momentum Relation**: For the muon, the energy is given by:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
   \]
   For the neutrino (negligible rest mass), the energy is:
   \[
   E_\nu = p.
   \]

4. **Solving for Momentum \(p\)**: Substituting \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\) and \(E_\nu = p\) into the energy conservation equation:
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
   \]
   Squaring both sides and solving for \(p\):
   \[
   p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
   \]
   Substituting \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
   \[
   m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2,
   \]
   \[
   p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

5. **Kinetic Energies**:
   - For the muon:
     \[
     E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV},
     \]
     \[
     KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - For the neutrino:
     \[
     KE_\nu = E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

6. **Verification**: The total kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu^+} + KE_\nu = 4.11 + 29.78 \approx 33.89 \, \text{MeV},
   \]
   which matches the total energy difference:
   \[
   KE_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
