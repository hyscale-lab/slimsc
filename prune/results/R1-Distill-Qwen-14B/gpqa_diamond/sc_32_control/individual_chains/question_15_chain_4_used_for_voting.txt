Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But wait, same masses, so that part doesn't affect the transit probability. 

Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars are important here: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radii. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but that probably doesn't affect their radius much since the radii are the same.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) divided by something else. Oh wait, no, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P ≈ (R*/a) / (1 + R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Or wait, maybe it's (R*/a) multiplied by something else? Hmm, maybe I should think about the geometry.

The transit probability depends on the angle at which we view the system. If the planet's orbit is edge-on to us, the probability is higher. More precisely, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet's orbit (a). So, P = (R*/a) multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's (R*/a) divided by (something). Wait, I think the exact formula for the transit probability is (R* / a) * (1 / (1 + (R*/a)^2))^(1/2), but wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I think the approximate probability is (R*/a), but that might be an oversimplification.

Wait, let me get this straight. The transit probability is the area of the star that the planet can block, divided by the total area of the star. Wait, no, that's not right. The probability depends on the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. So it's more about the relative sizes and the alignment.

The exact formula I recall is P = (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + (R*/a)^2 )) ), but maybe that's not quite right. Alternatively, the probability is (R*/a)^2 multiplied by some function, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe P is approximately (R*/a) multiplied by the solid angle or something.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is P ≈ (R*/a) * (1 - (R*/a)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R*/a) divided by (1 + sqrt(1 + (R*/a)^2)) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, I think I should look for a better approach. Let's think about the main factors that determine the transit probability. The probability is higher when the star is smaller (since R*/a is smaller), but wait, no, actually, when R*/a is smaller, the planet's orbital path is more likely to pass in front of the star, so a higher probability? Or wait, no—if a is the distance, a larger a would mean a smaller R*/a ratio, which would mean a lower probability, because the orbit is farther away from the star. So, if a is smaller, R*/a is larger, which would mean the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight, thus higher probability.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the geometry. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned so that it crosses our line of sight. The probability depends on the relative size of the star as seen from the planet's orbit. The probability is higher when the star is larger relative to the distance (so, if R* is large or a is small), because the planet's path has a higher chance of crossing our line of sight.

So the probability should be proportional to (R*/a). Because a larger R*/a ratio would mean that the planet's orbit is more likely to intersect our line of sight.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. The transit probability P can be approximated by the formula P = (R*/a) * (1 / sqrt(1 + (R*/a)^2)), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the formula might be P = (R*/a) * (something else). Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is roughly (R*/a)^2. But I'm getting stuck on the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the orbital distance a and the star's radius R*. The transit probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2 multiplied by some function, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think that the probability is given by (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + (R*/a)^2 ))^(1/2), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R*/a), but that might be an oversimplification. Let's say for the purpose of this problem, we can model the transit probability as being proportional to R*/a. Because that seems to be a common approximation used in such calculations.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about the formula. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it transits) is given by P = (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + (R*/a)^2))^(1/2). Hmm, that's what I vaguely remember. Alternatively, it might be (R*/(a + R*)) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the impact parameter. The impact parameter b is the distance of the center of the star from the planet's trajectory (in units of the star's radius). When b ≤ 1, the planet transits. The probability that b is ≤ 1 depends on the relative sizes. The probability is the ratio of the area where b ≤ 1 to the total possible area for b. Wait, this might be more accurate.

The impact parameter b is the closest approach of the planet's path to the center of the star. The maximum possible b is a * (cos i), where i is the inclination of the orbit. When i=90 degrees (edge-on), b=0 (transit). For other inclinations, b is larger. The probability that the planet transits is the probability that b ≤ R*, because if the planet's path comes within R* of the star's center, a transit occurs.

Wait, no, the impact parameter is measured in units of the star's radius. So, the maximum value for b is a/R* * sin i. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The impact parameter b is given by b = a sin i, where a is the orbital semi-major axis, and i is the inclination of the orbit (i=90 degrees is edge-on). The planet transits if b ≤ R* (the star's radius), but wait, R* is in the same units as a? Probably not. Wait, no, I think in the correct units, a is in meters, R* is also in meters, so b would have units of meters.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let's try a different approach. The transit probability is the fraction of the possible orbits (i.e., inclinations) that result in a transit. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the transit occurs, to the total possible area.

The probability can be approximated by (R*/a), assuming that a is much larger than R* (which is usually the case). So, the probability P is roughly proportional to R*/a.

Wait, but this might not account for the fact that the planet's orbit is at a distance a from the star. The larger a is, the smaller the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight, because the orbit is more distant. So, if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

In this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. Since Kepler's third law states that the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the star's mass M* by P² ∝ a³/(M*). So, for Planet_1 and Planet_2, which orbit stars of different masses, we can relate their semi-major axes.

Wait, let's get into more details. Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G M*) a³. So, for each planet, P² is proportional to a³/(M*). 

Given that Planet_1's orbital period is P1 = P2/3. Wait, wait, the question says that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, actually, the question says: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So, if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P1 = P/3.

So, for each planet, we can write Kepler's law as:

For Planet_1: (P1)^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) a1^3.

For Planet_2: (P2)^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3.

Since M1 is twice M2 (M1 = 2 M2), and P1 = P2 /3, we can relate a1 and a2.

Let me write the equations:

(P1²) / (P2²) = (a1³/(M1)) / (a2³/(M2)).

Substituting P1 = P2/3:

( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = ( a1³/(2 M2) ) / ( a2³/(M2) )

Simplify left side: (P2²/9)/(P2²) ) = 1/9.

Right side: (a1³/(2 M2)) * (M2/a2³) ) = (a1³)/(2 a2³).

So, 1/9 = (a1³)/(2 a2³).

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³:

(2 a2³)/9 = a1³.

Take cube roots:

a1 = cube_root( (2 a2³) / 9 )

= a2 * cube_root(2/9).

What's 2/9? Approximately 0.222, so cube root is about 0.6. Let me calculate:

cube_root(2/9) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So, a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

But wait, I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, 2/9 is 0.2222. Let's compute the cube root:

x = 0.2222

x^(1/3) = ?

We know that 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So, x ≈ 0.602.

So, a1 ≈ 0.602 a2.

So, a1 is approximately 0.6 times a2. So, planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star than planet_2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R*/a for each planet.

Wait, but the transit probability is also the same as (R*/a) / (something). Hmm, but if the probability is directly proportional to R*/a, then P ∝ R*/a.

But in this problem, both host stars have the same radius, R*. So R*1 = R*2 = R.

So, the transit probability for each planet would be:

P1 ∝ R/(a1)

P2 ∝ R/(a2)

Therefore, the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.602 a2, a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.602 ≈ 1.662.

So, P1 is about 1.66 times P2. So, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but wait a second. Because I thought the formula was P ∝ R*/a, so higher R*/a means higher probability. But in this case, Planet_1 has a smaller a, so R*/a is larger, so higher probability.

So Planet_1 has a transit probability about 1.66 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1 because it's more likely to transit.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

That's close to 1.66, so the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Given that a1 = cube_root( (2 a2³)/(9) ) = a2 * cube_root(2/9) = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 = 0.2222

Cube root of 0.2222: let's compute it more accurately.

We know that 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is 0.63 = 0.216.

0.6^3 = 0.216 → 0.63 = 0.216.

0.2222 is 0.0062 higher. Let me see: 0.602^3.

(0.6 + 0.002)^3 = 0.6^3 + 3*(0.6)^2*(0.002) + 3*(0.6)*(0.002)^2 + (0.002)^3.

= 0.216 + 3*0.36*0.002 + 3*0.6*0.000004 + 0.000000008.

= 0.216 + 0.00216 + 0.0000072 + 0.000000008.

Which is approximately 0.216 + 0.00216 = 0.21816, plus negligible terms. So, 0.602^3 ≈ 0.21816, which is a bit higher than 0.2222.

Wait, but 0.602^3 is ~0.218, which is less than 0.2222. So perhaps a better approximation would be 0.603^3.

0.603^3 = ?

0.6^3 = 0.216.

Compute (0.6 + 0.003)^3:

= 0.6^3 + 3*(0.6)^2 *0.003 + 3*(0.6)*(0.003)^2 + (0.003)^3.

= 0.216 + 3*(0.36)*0.003 + 3*(0.6)*(0.000009) + 0.000000027.

= 0.216 + 0.00324 + 0.0000162 + 0.000000027.

≈ 0.216 + 0.00324 = 0.21924.

Still less than 0.2222. So let's try 0.605:

0.605^3 = ?

Maybe it's easier to compute (0.6 + 0.005)^3.

= 0.6^3 + 3*(0.6)^2*0.005 + 3*0.6*(0.005)^2 + (0.005)^3.

= 0.216 + 3*(0.36)*0.005 + 3*0.6*0.000025 + 0.000000125.

= 0.216 + 0.0054 + 0.000045 + 0.000000125.

≈ 0.216 + 0.0054 = 0.2214, plus 0.000045 is 0.221445.

That's close to 0.2222. So 0.605^3 ≈ 0.221445, which is just under 0.2222. The difference is about 0.000755.

So, let's try 0.6055:

0.6055^3 ≈ ?

I can compute (0.605 + 0.0005)^3 using binomial expansion.

But maybe it's getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps a1 is approximately 0.605 a2, meaning that a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.605 ≈ 1.652, which is about 1.65 times.

So, the transit probability P1 is 1.65 times P2.

So, the transit probability of Planet_1 is higher than that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher chance to transit.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That matches our calculation.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R^*}{a} \), where \( R^* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital semi-major axis of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R^* \)), the probability depends on the ratio \( \frac{1}{a} \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M^*} \), where \( M^* \) is the mass of the host star, we relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes of the two planets. Let \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) be the orbital periods of Planet_1 and Planet_2, respectively, and \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) be the masses of their host stars. The problem states:
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star).

Substituting into Kepler's law:
\[
\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^2 = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}.
\]
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}.
\]
\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3.
\]
\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]
Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \), we find:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.6a_2.
\]

### Step 2: Calculating Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R^*}{a} \). Since \( R^* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R^*}{a_1}}{\frac{R^*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_1 is not 1.5 times higher but closer to 1.67 times.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_1 is not 2.7 times higher.

### Final Answer
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital distance, making it the better choice for observation. The closest match to the calculated ratio is **Option C**.

Answer: C
