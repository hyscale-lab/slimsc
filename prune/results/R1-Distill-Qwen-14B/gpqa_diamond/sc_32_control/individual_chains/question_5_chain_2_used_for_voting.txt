Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QM, but let's think through this step by step.

The problem says that the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often used for spin-1/2 particles like the muon here. The operator P probably corresponds to the spin operator in some direction.

Wait, the components Px, Py, and Pz are given as matrices. Let me write them down:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. I think that any direction in the x-z plane can be represented as something like (x, 0, z), but in spherical coordinates or using an angle theta. Wait, the direction should be in the x-z plane, so the angle would be measured from the z-axis, perhaps. So maybe the direction n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the direction vector could be represented as a unit vector in x-z plane, maybe (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator P along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices. So P = nx Px + nz Pz because Py would be zero since n is in x-z plane (so y-component is zero). Wait, no, because in the general case, the operator for spin in direction n is given by n_x S_x + n_y S_y + n_z S_z. But in our case, n is in x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me think about the components. The direction vector n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, perhaps, where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So P = (sinθ) * Px + (cosθ) * Pz.

Wait, no, because for a unit vector, n_x = sinθ cosφ, but in our case, since it's in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle could be from the x-axis or z-axis. Let me clarify: the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So let me write P as P = n_x * Px + n_z * Pz.

So substituting the matrices, Px is (ħ/2) σx, Pz is (ħ/2) σz. So P = (n_x (ħ/2) σx) + (n_z (ħ/2) σz).

The eigenvalue equation is (P) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, wait. The given eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So substituting P, we have [n_x (σx) + n_z (σz)] (ħ/2) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to get rid of that factor:

[n_x σx + n_z σz] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So σ = [n_x σx + n_z σz] |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but σx, σy, σz are the Pauli matrices. Let me write the matrix form of this operator.

The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator [n_x σx + n_z σz] becomes:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = 

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

The eigenvalues of this matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation:

det( [[n_z - λ, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - λ]] ) = 0.

Which is (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - n_x^2 = 0.

Expanding: (-n_z^2 - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ²) ) - n_x^2 = λ² - (n_z^2 + n_x^2) = 0.

But since n_x² + n_z² = 1 (unit vector), this becomes λ² - 1 = 0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, but our equation is [n_x σx + n_z σz] |ψ> = |ψ>, so the eigenvalue is 1. So we need the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 1.

So the equation for the eigenvector (a, b) is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T.

Which gives the equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let's write the first equation: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.
Second equation: n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0.

Wait, but since the eigenvalue is 1, the first equation is (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0.

Let me consider the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → n_x b = (1 - n_z) a → b = [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] a.

Assuming n_x is not zero. If n_x were zero, the problem would be different, but let's assume n_x ≠ 0.

So the eigenvector components are a and b = [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] a.

We can write the eigenvector as a [1; (1 - n_z)/n_x ].

But since the vector must be normalized, the length squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |a|^2 [1 + ((1 -n_z)/n_x )^2 ] = 1.

So |a|^2 = 1 / [ 1 + ((1 -n_z)/n_x )^2 ]

But let me compute this denominator.

Denominator: 1 + ( (1 -n_z)^2 ) / (n_x)^2 ) = [n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1, we can write n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

So denominator becomes [ (1 - n_z^2) + (1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2 ) ] / n_x^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator inside the denominator:

n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 = (1 - n_z^2) + (1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2 ) = 1 -n_z^2 +1 -2n_z +n_z^2 = 2(1 - n_z).

So the denominator becomes [2(1 - n_z)] / n_x^2.

So |a|^2 = 1 / [ (2 (1 - n_z) ) / n_x^2 ) ] = n_x^2 / [2(1 -n_z) ].

But |a|^2 must be positive. Let me think about (1 -n_z) being positive or not.

If n_z is less than 1, which it is because n is a unit vector, so n_z = cosθ, where θ is between 0 and π for the x-z plane.

Wait, n is in x-z plane, so θ would be the angle from the z-axis. So n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

So substituting n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

Then denominator becomes 2(1 - cosθ).

So |a|^2 = sin²θ / [2(1 - cosθ) ].

Hmm, let me simplify this. 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So sin²θ = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ]^2 = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2).

So putting it together:

|a|^2 = [4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)] / [2 * 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ].

Wait, denominator 2*(1 - cosθ) is 2*(2 sin²(θ/2)) )=4 sin²(θ/2).

So |a|^2 = [4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)] / [4 sin²(θ/2)] ) = cos²(θ/2).

So |a| = sqrt( cos²(θ/2) ) = |cos(θ/2)|. Since θ is between 0 and π, cos(θ/2) is positive, so |a|= cos(θ/2).

Similarly, b = [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] a = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ) ] * a.

Let's compute (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ.

We know that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = [sin(θ/2)] / [cos(θ/2)] = tan(θ/2).

So b = tan(θ/2) * a.

But a = cos(θ/2) (up to a phase, but since we're looking for real vectors or normalized, let's assume real for now), so b = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2 ) = sin(θ/2).

So the components are a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2).

Wait, but wait: let me double-check. If a = cos(θ/2), then b = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, the eigenvector can be multiplied by any phase. But in the options, some have phases like e^{iφ}, but others don't. So depends on the operator's symmetry.

Wait, the operator P is Hermitian because it's an observable. So its eigenvectors can be chosen to be real in this case, perhaps. Or maybe not, since the components might involve complex phases if the operator isn't diagonal.

Wait, but in our case, the operator [n_x σx + n_z σz] is Hermitian because σx and σz are Hermitian, and the sum is Hermitian. So its eigenvectors can be chosen as real vectors because the eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let's normalize it. The length is sqrt( cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ) = 1. So it's already normalized.

But wait, the problem stated the operator is along n in the x-z plane. So the direction theta is measured from the z-axis. So for example, theta=0 would be along +z, theta=pi/2 along +x, etc.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation we set up was for [n_x σx +n_z σz] |psi> = |psi>, which corresponds to eigenvalue 1. So the actual operator P in the problem is (ħ/2) times this operator. So the eigenvalue is (ħ/2) * 1 = ħ/2, which matches the given eigenvalue.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let me check this with a specific case. Let's take theta=0, so n is along +z.

In that case, n_x = 0, n_z =1.

The operator would be P = 0 * σx + 1 * σz. So P = σz.

The eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 (since ħ/2 * 1 is the given eigenvalue) is [1, 0]^T. So according to our formula, theta=0, so cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. So the vector is [1, 0], which matches. Good.

Another test case: theta=pi/2, so n along +x. Then n_x=1, n_z=0.

The operator is P = σx.

The eigenvalues are ±1. The eigenvectors are [1,1]/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1 and [1,-1]/sqrt(2) for -1.

Wait, according to our formula, theta=pi/2, so cos(theta/2)= cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. So the vector is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]. Which is the same as [1,1]/sqrt(2), correct.

Another test: theta=pi, n along -z. Then n_x=0, n_z=-1.

Operator P = -σz.

The eigenvalue for +1 would be -1, but wait, our problem's eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so perhaps in this case, the eigenvalue would be -1 for the operator [n_x σx + n_z σz], which is -σz. So, the +1 eigenvalue would require n_z=+1. If n_z is -1, then the eigenvalue would be -1, but since the problem specifies eigenvalue +ħ/2, this case would require n_z=+1.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the eigenvalue for the operator (n_x σx +n_z σz) is +1, leading to the eigenvalue (ħ/2)*1 = ħ/2.

So when n is along +z, we get the correct result. So the formula seems correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is a bit more complicated, involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which might come from another scenario.

Wait, but wait! Wait a minute. Wait the operator P is given as a vector operator, but the eigenvector depends on the direction of n. So the problem is in the x-z plane, which is the same as the x-z plane in spherical coordinates. So the angle theta is from the z-axis.

But wait, the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector's components depend on theta, the angle from the z-axis.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the options are written as:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that matches.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{iφ} sin(theta)). That looks like spherical coordinates, but it's not matching our result.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which doesn't seem to fit our normalized vector.

Option A has hbar factors, which don't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

So the correct option must be C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, and its components are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Express the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]
where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, and $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation becomes:
\[
\left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right) |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle,
\]
where the eigenvalue is normalized to $1$ by dividing through by $\hbar/2$. The matrix form of the operator is:
\[
n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for eigenvectors
The eigenvalues of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}$ are $\pm 1$, corresponding to the eigenvalue $\pm \hbar/2$ of $\vec{P}$. For the eigenvalue $+1$, the eigenvector satisfies:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the equations:
\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]
Solving these, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
\]
where $\theta$ is the polar angle of the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, with $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. This result matches the eigenvalue equation and ensures the vector is normalized.

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Contains $\hbar$ factors, which are irrelevant for normalized eigenvectors. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Involves spherical coordinates with $e^{i\phi}$, which does not match the derived eigenvector. Incorrect.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$. Correct.
- **Option D**: Includes additional normalization factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$) that are not present in the solution. Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
