Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my phosphate chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, right? So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

I remember that phosphate comes in different forms depending on the pH. The different species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The problem gives us the three Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. These are the acid dissociation constants.

So, the salts given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out what each of these dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, so we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. I'm trying to remember about buffer solutions and how these ions interact. The phosphate buffer system probably involves H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. To get PO4^3-, HPO4^2- must lose a proton. But looking at the Ka values, Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+.

Hmm, so the concentration of PO4^3- would come from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So, first, I'll calculate the moles of each salt in the solution.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass (g) / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007338 mol

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005607 mol

Wait a second, but wait, the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So the concentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.007338 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M.

Similarly, the concentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.005607 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028035 M.

But wait, these are the concentrations before any dissociation happens. Now, in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid by donating a proton, and HPO4^2- can act as an acid or a base.

Specifically, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

So, the solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But the problem asks for [PO4^3-], which is the concentration of the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-.

So, I think I should consider the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.

Wait, but I also have H2PO4^- in solution. So, the H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which would affect the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I should consider the equilibrium involving both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the overall reaction for H3PO4 in water is stepwise:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- → Ka1 = 7.5e-3

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- → Ka2 = 6.2e-8

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- → Ka3=1.8e-12

So, in solution, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, and they can deprotonate further. But since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it's a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem asks for the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the third deprotonation. So, I need to find [PO4^3-].

So, perhaps I should calculate how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

But before that, I need to consider the initial concentrations and any possible reactions.

Wait, but in the solution, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will influence the pH. The pH of the solution will determine how much of each species is present.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the pH of the solution first, using the buffer system from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, because then, once we have the pH, we can calculate how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

2. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

3. Use that pH to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Let me go through each step.

First, concentrations:

H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007338 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M

HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005607 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028035 M

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base).

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

Wait, but which pKa to use? Oh, right, because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since log(6.2) ≈ 0.79, so 7.21).

Wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21? Let me compute that accurately.

6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So for Ka2 =6.2e-8 → pKa2 = 7.2076.

So, the buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the concentrations:

pH = 7.2076 + log(0.028035 / 0.03669)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) ≈ -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.114 ≈ 7.0936.

So pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Because PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-. The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 for this reaction is 1.8e-12. So, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this as [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be calculated from pH. pH =7.09 → [H+] = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+]

Let me plug in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M.

[H+] is 8.23e-8.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.23e-8

Let me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 ≈ 5.046e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.046e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.046 / 8.23) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.613 * 1e-6 → 6.13e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, is that all? Because the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M, but some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, but in the solution, the HPO4^2- is both acting as a base and an acid. So, the [HPO4^2-] in the solution would be less than the initial 0.028 because some of it dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but earlier, when we used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we assumed that all the HPO4^2- remains as is. But actually, some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, this complicates things because the concentration of HPO4^2- isn't exactly 0.028 M because some of it is converted to PO4^3-.

Ah, so perhaps I need to account for the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- when calculating the pH.

Hmm, that makes things more complicated. Let me think.

Wait, when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces H+ and PO4^3-. So the [H+] would be higher than what was calculated from the buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the buffer calculation, we used the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations, but if HPO4^2- is dissociating, it would affect both the H+ concentration and the [HPO4^2-].

This seems a bit more involved. Maybe I should model this with the equilibrium expressions.

Let me denote the concentration of PO4^3- as x. Then, the change would be:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

At equilibrium:

[HPO4^2-] = initial [HPO4^2-] (0.028035) - x

But wait, considering that the solution is buffered by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the change in [H+] due to the dissociation of HPO4^2- might be small. Because Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates is negligible compared to the total. So perhaps x is very small, and we can approximate [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028035.

So, perhaps my initial approach is acceptable, that [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028 M, and [H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

But wait, the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2 (6.2e-8), so the contribution of HPO4^2- dissociation to [H+] is minimal compared to what comes from the buffer system.

So, the [H+] is approximately 8.23e-8 M, as calculated earlier.

So, using that, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.23e-8) ≈ (5.046e-14) / (8.23e-8) ≈ 6.13e-7 M.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to this. But let me recheck my calculations to be precise.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

First, the exact [H+] from pH=7.09.

pH =7.09 → [H+] = 10^(-7.09) → 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.09) is approx 0.812. So [H+] ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

Let me compute [PO4^3-] again.

Ka3 =1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] =0.028035 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.12e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028035 = let's compute 1.8 *0.028035 = 0.050463 → 0.050463e-12 → 5.0463e-14.

Denominator:8.12e-8.

So, 5.0463e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0463 /8.12) *1e-6.

5.0463 /8.12 ≈ 0.621.

So 0.621e-6 → 6.21e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.21e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or more precise calculations, but I think in this context, approximation is okay.

Wait, let me recheck the initial moles and concentrations.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007338 mol.

Concentration: 0.007338 /0.2 L=0.03669 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:1.00g /177.99 g/mol.

Let me compute 177.99 → approximately, 178 g/mol.

1.00 g /178 g/mol ≈ 0.00562 mol.

Wait, 177.99 is close to 178. So 1.00 /177.99 → 0.005607 mol.

Concentration: 0.005607 /0.2 L=0.028035 M.

So those are correct.

Wait, but when I calculated the pH, I used the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- as 0.028035 /0.03669 ≈ 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) is approximately?

Let me compute log(0.7647). Since log(0.7)= -0.1549, log(0.76)= log(7.6e-1) → log(7.6)=0.8808, so log(0.76)= 0.8808 -1= -0.1192. Wait, no: log(7.6)=0.8808, so log(0.76)= log(7.6 *1e-1) )= 0.8808 -1 = -0.1192.

Wait, but 0.7647 is slightly higher than 0.76. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me use the log approximation.

Let me compute ln(0.7647) to get a better estimate.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use calculator-like approach. Alternatively, use the fact that ln(0.7647) ≈ -0.268.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps accept that the pH calculation is correct as 7.09, leading to [H+] of 8.12e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] is about 6.21e-7 M, which is option A (6.24e-7). Hmm, very close.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7 M. That's about half of 6.24e-7. Could I have made a mistake? Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the HPO4^2- concentration is not 0.028, but less because some of it has dissociated into PO4^3-.

Wait, but considering that Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2 (6.2e-8), the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- is minimal, so the change in [HPO4^2-] is negligible. So, the initial approximation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution requires considering the combined system of all three dissociation steps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of PO4^3- can be found by considering the third dissociation, but perhaps I should consider the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution and their effect on the pH, which affects how much HPO4^2- dissociates.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system using all the equilibria. Let's try that.

We have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. Each can donate a proton.

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

But the solution is buffered by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using Ka2, as I did before. So I think that part is correct.

But the presence of H+ from the buffer will influence the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

So, the reaction for PO4^3- formation is:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

We already have [H+] from the buffer as 8.12e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.12e-8) ≈ (5.046e-14) / (8.12e-8) ≈ 6.21e-7 M.

So, that's option A: 6.24e-7.

But why is option D an option? Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 6.24x10^-7 M
B) 5.48x10^-7 M 
C) 2.81x10^-7 M
D) 3.97x10^-7 M 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total concentration of phosphate species, considering all the equilibria.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe the solution is simply the sum of the contributions from each salt, but that doesn't make sense because the ions can react.

Wait, another thought: the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which can interconvert. The orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, is formed when HPO4^2- loses a proton. The amount of PO4^3- is determined by the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact expression.

Let me denote:

Let [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M (approximately)

Let [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M

Let [PO4^3-] = x.

But considering that some HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but the presence of H+ in solution affects this. So, the equilibrium is:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

So, the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

But [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028035 M, and [H+] is 8.12e-8.

So, x = [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035)/(8.12e-8) ≈ 6.21e-7 M.

So, I think that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all species: [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-].

But in solution, H3PO4 is negligible because the pH is around 7, which is much higher than pKa1 (~2.12). So, [H3PO4] << others.

So, the sum is approximately [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.03669 + 0.028035 + x.

But without more info, I don't think this helps directly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution involves using the charge balance equation.

The solution must be electrically neutral, so the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges.

The positive ions come from K+ and Na+.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So moles of K+ = moles of KH2PO4 =0.007338 mol.

Moles of Na+ = 2 * moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 2 *0.005607 =0.011214 mol.

Total cations: K+ 0.007338 + Na+ 0.011214 = 0.018552 mol.

Anions: H2PO4^- (0.007338 mol) + HPO4^2- (0.005607 mol) + PO4^3- (x mol) + OH^- (from water) and any other anions from dissociation.

But since the solution is at pH 7.09, which is slightly acidic, but close to neutral, [H+] is 8.12e-8, so [OH-] is 1.23e-7.

So, the main anions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and OH^-.

But the charge balance equation is:

[K+] + [Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-]

Wait, because HPO4^2- has a charge of -2, so each contributes twice the concentration. Similarly, PO4^3- contributes three times its concentration.

So, substituting the values:

[ K+ ] = 0.007338 / 0.2 =0.03669 M

[ Na+ ] = 0.011214 /0.2 =0.05607 M

[ H+ ] =8.12e-8 M

[ H2PO4^- ] =0.03669 M

[ HPO4^2- ] =0.028035 M

[ PO4^3- ] =x.

[ OH^- ]=1.23e-7 M.

So, substituting into the charge balance equation:

0.03669 + 0.05607 +8.12e-8 ≈ (0.03669) + 2*(0.028035) +3x +1.23e-7

Wait, let me compute the left side: 0.03669 +0.05607 =0.09276; plus 8.12e-8 is negligible. So left ≈ 0.09276.

Right side: 0.03669 + 2*0.028035 = 0.03669 +0.05607= 0.09276, plus 3x and 1.23e-7.

So,

0.09276 ≈ 0.09276 +3x +1.23e-7.

Subtract 0.09276 from both sides: 0 ≈ 3x +1.23e-7 → 3x = -1.23e-7 → x≈-4.1e-8.

Wait, that can't be right. A negative concentration? That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, that suggests that my assumption that charge balance holds with the given concentrations is incorrect. So perhaps I need to include more accurate values.

Wait, perhaps the error arises because I'm neglecting the contribution of HPO4^2- and PO4^3- to the charge.

Wait, but the charge balance equation should hold. So, if the calculation gives x negative, that suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the [H+] is incorrect, or that other factors are at play.

But if x is negative, which is impossible, that suggests that my approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression considering that some HPO4^2- has dissociated. Let me try a more precise approach.

Let me denote the change in HPO4^2- as y, which dissociates into H+ and PO4^3-.

So,

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

Initial concentrations:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M

[H+] = 8.12e-8 M

[PO4^3-] =0.

Change:

[HPO4^2-] decreases by y → 0.028035 - y

[H+] increases by y →8.12e-8 + y ≈8.12e-8 (since y is very small)

[PO4^3-] increases by y → y

So, the equilibrium expression is:

Ka3 = ( [H+][PO4^3-] ) / [HPO4^2-] → 1.8e-12 = (8.12e-8 * y) / (0.028035 - y)

Assuming y is much smaller than 0.028035, we can approximate denominator as 0.028035.

So,

y ≈ (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / 8.12e-8 → same as before, y≈6.21e-7 M.

So, [PO4^3-]= y ≈6.21e-7 M.

But then, substituting back into the charge balance equation.

Charge balance:

[K+] + [Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-]

Substituting the numbers:

0.03669 (K+) +0.05607 (Na+) +8.12e-8 (H+) = 0.03669 (H2PO4^-) + 2*(0.028035 - y) (HPO4^2-) ) +3y (PO4^3-) +1.23e-7 (OH^-)

Compute left side: 0.03669+0.05607 =0.09276 +8.12e-8≈0.09276.

Right side: 0.03669 + 2*(0.028035 - y) +3y +1.23e-7.

Expand:

0.03669 + 0.05607 - 2y +3y +1.23e-7.

Which is 0.09276 + y +1.23e-7.

So,

0.09276 ≈0.09276 + y +1.23e-7.

Subtract 0.09276:

0 ≈ y +1.23e-7 → y= -1.23e-7.

Wait, that's impossible because y can't be negative. So, my assumption that y is negligible must be wrong. There's a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, maybe the charge balance approach is necessary, but perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial [H+] is not exactly 8.12e-8 M because the dissociation of HPO4^2- affects it. So, I can't use that value directly.

Let me consider the charge balance equation along with the equilibrium expressions.

We have:

1. The buffer equation using H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to find pH.

2. The dissociation of HPO4^2- to find [PO4^3-].

But perhaps these are interdependent and require simultaneous solving.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is not exactly 7.09 because the dissociation of HPO4^2- contributes some H+.

Wait, but the contribution from HPO4^2- dissociation is tiny, so maybe the initial pH calculation holds.

But then, why does the charge balance equation give a negative y?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the charge balance equation.

Wait, the charge balance equation should be:

Sum of cations = sum of anions.

Cations: K+ (0.03669 M), Na+ (0.05607 M), H+ (8.12e-8 M)

Anions: H2PO4^- (0.03669 M), HPO4^2- (0.028035 M), PO4^3- (x), OH^- (1.23e-7 M)

Wait, but HPO4^2- is -2 charge. So, the contribution is 2 * [HPO4^2-].

Similarly, PO4^3- is -3, so 3 * [PO4^3-].

So, the equation is:

0.03669 +0.05607 +8.12e-8 = 0.03669 + 2*(0.028035) +3x +1.23e-7.

Compute sum of cations: 0.03669 +0.05607 =0.09276. Plus H+ is negligible.

Sum of anions: 0.03669 +2*0.028035 =0.03669 +0.05607= 0.09276. Plus 3x and 1.23e-7.

So,

0.09276 =0.09276 +3x +1.23e-7.

Subtract 0.09276:

0 =3x +1.23e-7 → x= -4.1e-8.

Which is impossible. So, this suggests that the initial assumption of [H+] is incorrect, and perhaps the pH is different.

Hmm, maybe the buffer equation approach is missing something. Let me think: perhaps the presence of PO4^3- affects the pH.

Wait, that would complicate things further. Because the presence of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-, which in turn affects [H+], which in turn affects the pH, which affects the buffer system.

So, perhaps a more accurate approach would involve solving for x (PO4^3-) and pH simultaneously.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this with the exact equations.

Let me denote:

Let [H+] = h.

We have three equilibria:

1. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-; Ka2=6.2e-8.

So, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * Ka2 / h.

2. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / h.

3. Also, the buffer equation using H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/h.

Substituting into the buffer equation:

pH = pKa2 + log( (Ka2 [H2PO4^-]/h ) / [H2PO4^-] )

= pKa2 + log(Ka2 /h )

Which gives:

pH = pKa2 + log(Ka2) - log h.

But pKa2 is -log(Ka2), so:

pH = (-log(Ka2)) + log(Ka2) - log h.

So, pH = -log h → h = 10^(-pH).

Wait, but that seems to suggest that h is 10^(-pH), which is the usual relation, but I'm not sure if this approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the charge balance equation along with the buffer equation would help.

The charge balance equation is:

[K+] + [Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-]

We know [K+], [Na+], [H2PO4^-], [HPO4^2-], [PO4^3-], [H+], and [OH^-].

But this seems complicated. Let me try plugging in the values.

We have:

0.03669 + 0.05607 + h = 0.03669 + 2*(0.028035) + 3x + 1.23e-7.

Wait, 0.03669 +0.05607 =0.09276.

0.03669 + 2*0.028035 =0.03669 +0.05607=0.09276.

So,

0.09276 +h =0.09276 + 3x + 1.23e-7.

Subtract 0.09276:

h =3x +1.23e-7.

But h is [H+] =10^(-pH). And from the buffer equation, we have:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

=7.2076 + log(0.028035/0.03669) → which we computed as ≈7.09.

So, pH=7.09 → h=10^(-7.09)=8.12e-8.

So,

8.12e-8 =3x +1.23e-7 → 3x=8.12e-8 -1.23e-7 = (0.812 -1.23)e-7 → (-0.418)e-7 → x= (-0.418e-7)/3 ≈-1.39e-8.

Which is negative, impossible. So, this suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect, and perhaps the buffer equation approach doesn't account for all factors.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution also has some H3PO4, but that's unlikely because at pH 7, H3PO4 is mostly deprotonated.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial concentrations.

Wait, 1.00g of Na2HPO4·2H2O divided by 177.99 g/mol: let me compute it accurately.

177.99 g/mol is approximately 178 g/mol.

1.00 g /177.99 g/mol = 1.00 /177.99 ≈0.005607 mol.

So, that's correct.

H2PO4^- concentration: 0.007338 mol /0.2 L =0.03669 M.

HPO4^2- concentration: 0.005607 /0.2 =0.028035 M.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation, considering the pH from the buffer.

So, using Ka3 and the pH, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

Which gives 6.21e-7 M, which is option A.

But why does the charge balance equation give a negative x? Maybe I'm missing some other anion, but I accounted for OH^-.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the charge balance equation. Let me re-express it:

Sum of cations = Sum of anions.

Cations: K+ (0.03669), Na+ (0.05607), H+ (8.12e-8).

Anions: H2PO4^- (0.03669), HPO4^2- (0.028035), PO4^3- (x), OH^- (1.23e-7).

But HPO4^2- contributes 2- charge, so 2 * 0.028035.

PO4^3- contributes 3- charge, so 3x.

So, the equation is:

0.03669 +0.05607 +8.12e-8 = 0.03669 + 2*(0.028035) +3x +1.23e-7.

Wait, let's compute the left side:

0.03669 +0.05607 =0.09276.

Add 8.12e-8 → 0.09276 +0.0000000812 ≈0.0927600812.

Right side:

0.03669 + 2*0.028035 =0.03669 +0.05607=0.09276.

Plus 3x and 1.23e-7 →0.09276 +3x +0.000000123.

So equation:

0.0927600812 =0.09276 +3x +0.000000123.

Subtract 0.09276 from both sides:

0.0000000812 =3x +0.000000123.

So,

3x = 0.0000000812 -0.000000123 = -0.0000000418 → x≈-0.0000000139 M.

Which is impossible as x can't be negative. So, this suggests that either the model is wrong or there's another factor I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge balance equation. Let me re-examine it.

The correct charge balance equation should be:

Sum of positive charges = sum of negative charges.

Positive charges:

[K+] = 0.03669 M.

[Na+] =0.05607 M.

[H+] =8.12e-8 M.

Total positive: 0.03669 +0.05607 +8.12e-8 =0.09276008 M.

Negative charges:

[H2PO4^-] =0.03669 M → contributes 0.03669.

[HPO4^2-] =0.028035 M → contributes 2 *0.028035 =0.05607.

[PO4^3-] =x → contributes 3x.

[OH^-] = 1.23e-7 → contributes 1.23e-7.

Total negative: 0.03669 +0.05607 +3x +1.23e-7 =0.09276 +3x +1.23e-7.

So,

0.09276008 ≈0.09276 +3x +1.23e-7.

Subtract 0.09276:

0.00000008008 ≈3x +1.23e-7.

So,

3x ≈0.00000008008 -0.000000123 = -0.00000004292 → x≈-1.43e-8.

Which is impossible. So, this suggests that the model is missing something.

Wait, but if the pH is 7.09, then [H+]=8.12e-8, and [OH^-]=1.23e-7.

But perhaps the presence of PO4^3- is so negligible that the charge balance equation doesn't account for it. But according to this, the charge isn't balanced, which is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is actually not neutral, and the charge balance equation indicates that [H+] is higher than calculated from the buffer.

But that complicates things, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go back to the initial approach and select the answer that aligns with the calculation of approximately 6.2e-7, which is option A.

But why is option D present as another option? Maybe I made a mistake in the buffer calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the buffer pH.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the base is HPO4^2- (0.028035 M) and the acid is H2PO4^- (0.03669 M).

So,

pH =7.2076 + log(0.028035/0.03669).

Compute the ratio: 0.028035/0.03669 ≈0.7647.

Log(0.7647) ≈-0.114.

So,

pH≈7.2076-0.114≈7.0936.

So, that's correct.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028035)/(8.12e-8) =6.21e-7.

Which is option A.

But the charge balance equation suggests this is impossible, which makes me think I'm missing something. But perhaps the charge balance equation is approximately satisfied because the discrepancy is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of PO4^3- is so small that it's negligible in the charge balance equation. But in this case, it's about 6e-7, which is larger than 1e-7. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error arises because the initial [HPO4^2-] is not exactly 0.028035 M because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

But earlier, we assumed that y is negligible compared to 0.028035. But if y is about 6e-7 M, which is about 2e-8 of 0.028 M, that's 0.028 M * (6e-7 /0.028) )= 0.021%, which is negligible. So the approximation holds.

Thus, I think the correct answer is option A:6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g each of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$ and $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$, with molar masses of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L). The dissociation constants for $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$ are given as $K_a1 = 7.5 \times 10^{-3}$, $K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$, and $K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}$.

### Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations
- Moles of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$:  
  $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol}$.  
  Concentration of $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$:  
  $\frac{0.007338 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03669 \, \text{M}$.

- Moles of $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$:  
  $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol}$.  
  Concentration of $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$:  
  $\frac{0.005607 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M}$.

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ (acid) and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$ (base), with $K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$. The relevant $pK_a$ is:  
$pK_a2 = -\log(K_a2) \approx -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076$.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
$\text{pH} = pK_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)$.  
Substitute the concentrations:  
$\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log\left(\frac{0.028035}{0.03669}\right)$.  
$\frac{0.028035}{0.03669} \approx 0.7647$, and $\log(0.7647) \approx -0.114$.  
Thus, $\text{pH} \approx 7.2076 - 0.114 \approx 7.0936$.

### Step 3: Calculate $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$ using $K_a3$
The dissociation of $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$ into $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ is governed by $K_a3$:  
$K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}$.  
Rearranging:  
$[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}$.

From $\text{pH} = 7.0936$, $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} \approx 10^{-7.0936} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}$.  
Substitute the values:  
$[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}$.  
Numerator: $(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035) \approx 5.046 \times 10^{-14}$.  
Denominator: $8.12 \times 10^{-8}$.  
$[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \approx \frac{5.046 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$.

### Step 4: Verify the result
The calculated concentration of $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ is approximately $6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$, which aligns closely with option A ($6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
