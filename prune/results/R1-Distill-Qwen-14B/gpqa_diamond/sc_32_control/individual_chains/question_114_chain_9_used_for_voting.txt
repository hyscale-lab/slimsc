Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves two reactions and asks us to select the correct reagents from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

And the options are A to D, each with different A and B reagents.

First, I need to figure out what's happening in each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. It's reacting with NaCN (sodium cyanide) and a reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that structure? Let me think. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, and the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN maybe? Hmm, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. Butane is four carbons. The nitrile is on carbon 1. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile group on C1, a hydroxyl and methyl on C2, and then two more carbons? Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons in total, right? So the structure is CH2CH2CN? Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? No, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, no. Wait, butane is four carbons, so nitrile is on the end. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO reacting with NaCN to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh, wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons with the nitrile at the end. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH2OH)(CH3)C-CH2CN? Or perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but the product has four carbons. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, what's the typical reaction? Oh, right, in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So maybe the cyanide ion is acting as a nucleophile here. Wait, but if that's the case, in what conditions? If it's a ketone, adding HCN would typically give a cyanohydrin. But here, we have NaCN. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed addition.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in the case of ketones, adding HCN (which is a weak acid) requires a catalyst. But if we have a strong acid, maybe the ketone is protonated, making it more electrophilic, and then the CN- attacks. But in the presence of a strong acid, that's possible. So the reaction of butan-2-one with NaCN and H3O+ (which is option A) would protonate the carbonyl, making it more susceptible to attack by the cyanide ion. So the cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon, leading to a cyanohydrin formation. Wait, but the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN under acidic conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanone is (CH3)2CO, so adding HCN would add to the carbonyl, giving (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's a cyanohydrin, which is 2-hydroxypropanenitrile? Wait, no. Wait, but the product is named 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be a four-carbon chain with the nitrile on carbon 1, a hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the structure. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO—three carbons including the carbonyl. So when HCN adds, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Oh, but the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl and methyl groups.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think: butan-2-one is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH3? No, no. No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN and a reagent A, which helps in the addition, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So the nitrile is on the fourth carbon, but that can't be because butanenitrile is four carbons. So for butanenitrile, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CN. So if we have (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN, that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the fourth carbon? That doesn't make sense because butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so the nitrile is on the first carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN. Then the nitrile is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

CH2CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)2?

Wait, maybe I should move on for a moment. So, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. So, the general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin.

The conditions for this are typically acidic. Because HCN is a weak acid, and adding a strong acid (like H3O+) would help generate more CN- by protonating HCN. So in the first step, butan-2-one is treated with NaCN (which provides CN-) and a strong acid like H3O+. So that makes sense, so reagent A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, which ones have A as H3O+? Options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is sodium bisulfate, a source of HSO3- which is a weaker acid than H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So that leaves us with options A and B for the first step. Now, the second reaction is about converting a nitrile into a carboxylic acid. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding carboxylic acid. The reagent is B, which is H2O. So the reaction is likely hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. The typical methods are:

1. Under acidic conditions: using H2SO4 and H2O, heat. This converts nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction is: R-CN → R-COOH.

2. Under basic conditions: using NaOH and H2O, heat. Then acid work-up gives the carboxylic acid.

So in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but what else is present? The options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: B is HCl

Option B: B is CH3COOH

Wait, but in the second reaction, B is H2O, but the options specify B as either HCl or another acid.

Wait, the question says the second reaction uses B (H2O). So, perhaps the hydrolysis is done with aqueous acid.

So for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then it's acidic hydrolysis. So the nitrile would be converted to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid (CH3COOH), that's also an acid, but perhaps a milder one.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So for the hydrolysis, in the acidic conditions, you would add H+ and water.

So in the options, when the second reaction uses B as HCl, which is a strong acid, that would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

But what about the first reaction? Let me recap:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin. So A is H3O+ because that's needed to generate the necessary protons to activate the carbonyl for nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So looking at options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → possible.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → possible.

Now, the second reaction uses B (H2O) as the solvent, but what's the actual reagent? The question says reagent B is H2O, but the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, the question states that the second reaction is with B (H2O). So the reagent is H2O, but perhaps in acidic or another condition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is performed in aqueous HCl or aqueous acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is done under acidic conditions, using H2O and an acid catalyst. So if B is HCl, then the solution is acidic, and the nitrile hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH (acetic acid), then it's a milder acid, but still provides the necessary H+ for the hydrolysis.

So in that case, both options A and B could be possible for the second reaction. But which one is correct?

Wait, but another factor is the presence of a hydroxyl group in the molecule. The starting material for the second reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a more complex molecule, but it's a secondary alcohol and a nitrile.

When you hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you go through an amide or ammonium intermediate. But in acidic conditions, it's more likely to proceed all the way to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Let me think about the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis.

In acidic conditions, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids with the help of strong acids like HCl, often under heat. In basic conditions, you get an ammonium salt, which upon acidification gives the carboxylic acid.

So for the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile. So to get a carboxylic acid, the reaction needs to be done under acidic conditions. So reagent B would be HCl (a strong acid) or another acid.

Looking back at the options, for the second reaction, B could be HCl (option A) or acetic acid (option B). But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. Would that be sufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile? I think HCl is a stronger acid and would be more effective in facilitating the reaction, especially if heat is involved. So perhaps option A is correct.

Wait, but what about the presence of the hydroxyl group? Since the molecule already has a hydroxyl group, perhaps under acidic conditions, the OH could be protonated, making the molecule more stable. But that's probably not a big issue here.

So, putting it together: the first reaction uses H3O+ as reagent A. The second reaction uses HCl as reagent B. So the correct option is A, where A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → correct.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → maybe not as strong for hydrolysis.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me check other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step uses a different condition. What if the second step is using H2O with HCl? That makes sense for acid hydrolysis.

Another point to consider: the first reaction. If A were NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfate), which is a weaker acid than H3O+, would that work? Probably not as effectively, because the ketone's carbonyl needs to be sufficiently protonated to attract the nucleophile (CN-). So H3O+ is a stronger acid and more effective, so A must be H3O+.

Therefore, the correct option is A: A=H3O+ and B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻). The reaction forms a cyanohydrin, which is a nucleophilic addition product. For this reaction to occur efficiently, the carbonyl group of the ketone must be activated. This is typically achieved under acidic conditions, where the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and susceptible to attack by CN⁻. 

From the options, reagent A must be a strong acid to facilitate this protonation. **H₃O⁺** (option A and B) is suitable, while **NaHSO₃** (option C and D) is a weaker acid and less effective for this purpose. Therefore, A must be **H₃O⁺**.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions typically requires a strong acid, such as HCl, to drive the reaction to completion. While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is also an acid, it is weaker and less effective for this transformation, especially for a complex molecule like the starting material.

From the options, **HCl** (option A) is the better choice for reagent B, as it provides the strong acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **option A**.

Answer: A
