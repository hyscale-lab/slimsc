Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering. Hmm, the question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that scattering amplitude has both real and imaginary parts, and the imaginary part relates to the cross-section or something like that.

Wait, the phase shifts are given: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13. The rest are ignored. Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the phase shifts. But wait, I think the formula for f(θ) depends on the angle and the phase shifts.

The formula, as I recall, is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) * [ sin(k r_0 (l) (1 - cosθ)) ] * [ δ_l ] / (1 - cosθ), but wait, no, that's more for the Born approximation or something else. Oh wait, another approach comes to mind. The scattering amplitude can be expressed using the partial waves.

Right, the scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ) = 4π/(k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, but I'm only asked about the imaginary part along the incident direction. In the direction of the incident beam, θ would be 0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam is the initial direction.

Wait, but when θ is 0 degrees, cosθ is 1. The Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are equal to 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. So for each l, the term becomes (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * 1. So the imaginary part of f is (4π/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l * Re( e^{i δ_l} ) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The imaginary part of each term (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. Since e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ, so (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ = (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute Im(f) for each l and sum. Let's break down each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) * Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) = (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l = (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, because e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So when you multiply e^{i δ} by sin δ, you get sin δ (cos δ + i sin δ). The imaginary part of this is sin δ * sin δ = sin² δ.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l. So the total imaginary part of f is (4π/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

But wait, the problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond those given. So we only consider l=0,1,2,3,4.

So let's compute each term:

For l=0:
2l+1 = 1
δ0 = 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians. sin(90°) = 1. So sin²(δ0) = 1.
Term: 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1:
2l+1 =3
δ1=67 degrees. Let's compute sin(67) first. Using calculator, sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So sin² ≈ 0.847.
Term: 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2:
2l+1=5
δ2=55 degrees. sin(55)≈0.8192, sin²≈0.671.
Term:5 *0.671≈3.355.

l=3:
2l+1=7
δ3=30 degrees. sin(30)=0.5, sin²=0.25.
Term:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:
2l+1=9
δ4=13 degrees. sin(13)≈0.22495, sin²≈0.0506.
Term:9 *0.0506≈0.455.

Adding these up: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; +3.355=6.896; +1.75=8.646; +0.455=9.101.

So sum = approximately 9.101.

Now, the formula for Im(f) is (4π/k) * sum. But wait, what's k? k is the wave number, which is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Hmm, but wait, the energy given is 50 MeV for the electrons. Wait, the units here are important.

Wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so we're only considering l=0 to l=4.

But I need to calculate k. The energy E is 50 MeV. Hmm, but the mass m of the electron is needed. Let me recall the formula for k.

k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But E here is the kinetic energy, so we can use E = (p²)/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mE).

Wait, but the units are in MeV. Let me think in terms of natural units. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in units where ħ=1 and c=1, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I need to compute k in terms of the given energy. Let me think about the correct approach.

E is given as 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV/c².

So E = 50 MeV, m = 0.511 MeV/c².

But wait, the expression for k is (2mE)^{1/2} / ħ.

Wait, but in natural units (ħ=1, c=1), but when using SI units, the calculation would be more involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relationship in terms of the Compton wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of the momentum. Because in the expression for k, we have:

k = p / ħ, where p is the momentum.

Wait, E = p²/(2m) + m (if rest energy is considered), but for high energies, like 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), the rest mass can be neglected. So E ≈ p²/(2m).

So p ≈ sqrt(2mE).

But wait, since E is in MeV, and m is in MeV/c², let's compute p in terms of MeV/c.

Wait, m = 0.511 MeV/c².

E =50 MeV.

So p^2 = 2mE.

p = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV) = sqrt( 51.1 MeV²/c² ) ≈ sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ≈ 7.15 MeV/c.

So p ≈7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / ħ. But ħ is about 197.33 MeV fm (since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ ≈ 197.33 MeV fm / c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, since c is in MeV units when using natural units).

Wait, no, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In natural units, ħ=6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps it's easier to work in units where ħ=1 and c=1. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate k in units of 1/fm.

Given E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV/c².

So k = (2mE)^(1/2) / ħ.

Wait, wait, let's compute ħ in units of MeV·s.

Wait, no, I think it's better to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers because the options are in fm.

Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

Wait, the Compton wavelength of the electron is ħ/(m c), which is about 2.426e-12 meters or 2.426 fm.

So, ħ = m c * wavelength. Hmm, but perhaps I can compute k as sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, let me make sure.

E = p²/(2m) + m, but since E is much larger than m, E ≈ p²/(2m).

So, p = sqrt(2mE).

Then, k = p / ħ.

Hmm, but I think I need to ensure that the units are consistent.

So, m is in MeV/c². E is in MeV.

So, let me compute p in MeV/c.

p = sqrt(2 * m * E) = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV).

This gives p² = 2 * 0.511 * 50 (MeV)^2 / c².

So p = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ≈7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But ħ is in units of MeV·s. So, I think I need to express k in (1/fm).

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute ħ in units of MeV·fm.

Since 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ = h / (2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

Convert ħ to MeV·fm.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J.

1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, ħ in MeV·fm is:

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s * (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) * (1 m / 1e-15 fm )

Wait, let's compute:

ħ [MeV·fm] = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) * (1 fm / 1e-15 m)

Wait, because 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². So, 1.05457e-34 J·s = 1.05457e-34 kg·m²/s.

But to convert J to MeV, 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J. So,

ħ in MeV·fm is:

(1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-13 J/MeV) ) * (1 fm / 1e-15 m) )

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, J·s to MeV·s:

1 J = 1 / 1.602e-13 MeV → 1 J·s = 1 / 1.602e-13 MeV·s.

So, 1.05457e-34 J·s = (1.05457e-34) / (1.602e-13) MeV·s ≈ 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Now, convert meters to fm:

1 m = 1e15 fm. So, 1 J·s = 1 kg·m²/s²·s = kg·m²/s.

But perhaps another approach: 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, converting ħ from J·s to MeV·fm:

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s * (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) * (1 m / 1e-15 fm)

Wait, J·s * MeV/J = MeV·s.

And then, m / fm = 1e15 fm/m → wait, no, 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, to convert meters to fm, multiply by 1e15 fm/m.

So, 1 J·s → (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) → MeV·s.

Then, 1 m → 1e15 fm.

So,

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s * (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) * (1 m / 1e-15 fm)

= 1.05457e-34 * (1 / 1.602e-13) * (1 / 1e-15) MeV·fm

Wait,

= 1.05457e-34 * (1 / 1.602e-13) * 1e15 MeV·fm

= 1.05457e-34 * (1e15 / 1.602e-13) MeV·fm

Compute 1e15 / 1.602e-13 → 1e28 / 1.602 ≈ 6.24e27.

Hmm, wait, that can’t be right. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recast:

1.05457e-34 J·s * (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) → (1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13) MeV·s.

Which is approximately 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Then, to convert meters to fm, since 1 m = 1e15 fm, 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, when you have meters in the unit, you can multiply by 1e15 fm/m to convert to fm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of 1 J·s = 1 (kg·m²/s²)·s = kg·m²/s.

But maybe it's easier to use the known value of ħ in MeV·fm. From what I remember, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but to convert that to MeV·fm:

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV.

So, 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

But I'm trying to find ħ in MeV·fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find ħ in units of MeV·fm by using the conversion:

1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

Convert J to MeV:

1 J = 1 / 1.602e-13 MeV.

So, 1.05457e-34 J·s = 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13 MeV·s ≈ 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Now, convert seconds to fm:

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ħ in terms of MeV·fm by using the speed of light.

Wait, the Compton wavelength is ħ/(m c). So,

λ_C = ħ/(m c).

So, λ_C ≈ 2.426e-12 m = 2.426 fm.

Since m is the electron mass, 0.511 MeV/c².

So, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

Then,

λ_C = ħ/(m c) → ħ = m c λ_C.

So,

ħ = (0.511 MeV/c²) * c * (2.426e-15 m) → 0.511 MeV * 2.426e-15 m.

Wait, but m is in kg, but perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the known value of ħ: approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

But, 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, so 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

But to express in terms of fm, since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, perhaps I can find ħ in MeV·fm by considering the conversion from seconds to fm.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look up that ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

But I'm getting stuck on the unit conversion here. Perhaps I should proceed with the calculation using natural units where ħ=1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the value of k in terms of the given energy.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude is often expressed in terms of the differential cross-section.

The differential cross-section is given by dσ/dΩ = (|f|²), but more accurately, for elastic scattering, dσ/dΩ = (|f|^2) (something with 16π or 4π?), but perhaps the exact formula is:

dσ/dΩ = (4π/k²) |f(θ)|².

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, but the problem is specifically about the imaginary part. So going back, the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l came out to be approximately 9.101.

So, the formula is Im(f) = (4π/k) * sum.

But I need to compute k. Let's try again.

We have E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV/c².

So, the momentum p is sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 0.511 * 50) MeV/c.

Compute 2 *0.511 =1.022, 1.022 *50=51.1.

So p= sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV/c.

Now, k is p/ħ. But what is ħ in units of MeV·fm?

Wait, I think I can find ħ in units of MeV·fm.

From Wikipedia, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, so ħ = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

But to get ħ in MeV·fm, since 1 fm=1e-15 m, and 1 m = 3e8 m/s (speed of light), but perhaps I can find the conversion factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

Because ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Since c is approximately 3e8 m/s, and 1 m = 1e15 fm,

So, ħ c ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s * 3e8 m/s.

But 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, I remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

Yes, that's a commonly used value.

So, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

But since c is in fm/s, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k as follows.

k = p / ħ.

But p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV·fm/c, because ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

Wait, so:

p = 7.15 MeV/c.

ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/c.

So,

k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/c) ) = 7.15 / 197.33 fm^-1.

Compute that:

7.15 / 197.33 ≈ 0.0362 fm^-1.

So, k ≈ 0.0362 fm^-1.

Wait, because 7.15 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.0362.

So, 1/k ≈ 27.62 fm.

Now, putting it all together.

Im(f) = (4π/k) * sum.

Sum is approximately 9.101.

So,

Im(f) = (4π * 9.101) / (0.0362) fm.

Compute 4π ≈ 12.566.

12.566 * 9.101 ≈ 114.1.

114.1 / 0.0362 ≈ 3151.9 fm.

Wait, that's way bigger than any of the options. Hmm, the options are around 177 to 251 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

Wait, I have p = 7.15 MeV/c.

And ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) = (7.15) / (197.33 fm) ) * (c/c) → units of 1/fm.

So, k = 7.15 / 197.33 fm^-1 ≈ 0.0362 fm^-1.

So, 1/k ≈ 27.62 fm.

Then, 4π/k ≈ (4 * 3.1416) / 0.0362 ≈ (12.566) / 0.0362 ≈ 347.1 fm.

Multiply by sum of 9.101: 347.1 * 9.101 ≈ 3154 fm.

Which is way higher than the options provided. The given options are A) 87163.4 fm, B) 355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

So, something's wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that k is in 1/fm, but in the formula, it's (4π/k) * sum, where sum is dimensionless.

Wait, but then, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is:

Im(f) = (4π/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f) = (4π/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait no, earlier I thought each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in that derivation.

Wait, let's go back. The term for each l in the amplitude is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(1).

Wait, no, earlier I thought that f is 4π/k sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1.

So, f = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * 1.

So, f = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of f is (4π/k) sum (2l+1) * Im[e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ].

But e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ.

So, e^{i δ} sin δ = sin δ (cos δ + i sin δ) = sin δ cos δ + i sin^2 δ.

So, the imaginary part is sin^2 δ.

Thus, Im(f) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier. So the calculation seems correct.

But then why is the result so large compared to the options?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k.

Wait, let's think again.

k = p / ħ.

But wait, I have p in MeV/c, and ħ in MeV fm.

Wait, perhaps I should be using units more carefully.

Let me compute in natural units where ħ = c =1.

In that case, E (in MeV) is same as p (in MeV/c) * c.

So, in natural units, E = p, because E (MeV) = p (MeV/c) * c (c=1).

Thus, p = E =50 MeV/c.

Wait, but then, using the non-relativistic formula E = p²/(2m), but at 50 MeV, which is much larger than m c²=0.511 MeV, so perhaps relativistic formulas are needed. Hmm, maybe I should use relativistic expressions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of E and m.

In natural units (ħ= c =1), the momentum p is given by E² = p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4.

But since E is much larger than m c², p ≈ E/c.

Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so p ~ E.

But I'm getting stuck on unit conversions here.

Alternative approach: use the fact that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

But, because c is in fm/s, but perhaps I can express k in 1/fm.

Given that, and p = sqrt(2 m E), but E is in MeV, m in MeV/c².

Wait, let me compute p.

p = sqrt( 2 m E ) → 2 m E = 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV = 51.1 MeV²/c².

So, p = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ≈7.15 MeV/c.

Now, k = p / ħ → (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) = 7.15 / 197.33 fm^-1 ≈ 0.0362 fm^-1.

So, 1/k ≈27.62 fm.

So, 4π/(k) ≈4 *3.1416 /0.0362 ≈347.1 fm.

Sum of terms is ~9.101.

So, Im(f) = 347.1 *9.101 ≈3154 fm.

But none of the options are anywhere near this. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula for f is actually f = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) / (k (1 - cosθ)) ) ?

No, I think that's the Molière formula or something else.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f is given by f = (4π/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l / (k (1 - cosθ)) ) P_l(cosθ).

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I'm confusing different scattering formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (4π/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Maybe it's better to refer to the partial wave expansion.

The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) / (2ik).

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, that would make sense because at θ=0, (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(1) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But then, how does the imaginary part factor in? Because e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ.

So, e^{i δ} sin δ = sin δ (cos δ + i sin δ) = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

The imaginary part is sin² δ.

Thus, Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula was (4π/k) sum ... so perhaps I have a mistake in the factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So, when I compute (4π/k) * sum, it gives me Im(f).

But with k = 0.0362 fm^-1, 4π/k is about 347.1 fm, as before.

So, 347.1 fm *9.101 ≈3154 fm. But the options are much smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Let me recheck the sum:

l=0: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * (sin 67)^2 ≈3*(0.9205)^2 →3*0.847 ≈2.541.

l=2:5*(sin55)^2 →5*(0.8192)^2 →5*(0.671) ≈3.355.

l=3:7*(sin30)^2 →7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9*(sin13)^2 →9*(0.22495)^2 →9*(0.0506)≈0.455.

Adding:1+2.541=3.541 +3.355=6.896 +1.75=8.646 +0.455=9.101.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula doesn't include (4π/k), but only (1/k). So Im(f) = (1/k) sum.

Then, 1/k is about 27.62 fm.

Sum is 9.101 → 27.62 *9.101≈251.2 fm.

Ah, that matches option D) 251.271 fm.

So perhaps I included an extra factor of 4π somewhere.

Wait, the confusion comes from the exact expression for the scattering amplitude.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l (cosθ).

So, the imaginary part is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Thus, the correct calculation is 1/k * sum.

1/k is 27.62 fm.

27.62 *9.101 ≈251.2 fm.

Which matches option D.

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of terms
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). The rest are ignored. For each \(l\), the contribution is \((2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l\). Calculating each term:

- For \(l=0\): \((2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_0 = 1 \cdot \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
- For \(l=1\): \((2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_1 = 3 \cdot \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.9205^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.847 = 2.541\).
- For \(l=2\): \((2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_2 = 5 \cdot \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 = 3.355\).
- For \(l=3\): \((2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_3 = 7 \cdot \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\).
- For \(l=4\): \((2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_4 = 9 \cdot \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.455\).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 \approx 9.101
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the energy \(E\) and the mass \(m\) of the electron. Using the relativistic relation \(E = pc\) for high-energy electrons (\(E \gg m c^2\)), the momentum \(p\) is:

\[
p = \sqrt{2mE}
\]

Here, \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). Substituting:

\[
p = \sqrt{2 \cdot 0.511 \cdot 50} \, \text{MeV}/c = \sqrt{51.1} \, \text{MeV}/c \approx 7.15 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

The wave number \(k\) is then:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar}
\]

Using \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm}\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{7.15 \, \text{MeV}/c}{197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm}/c} = \frac{7.15}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.0362 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}(f)\)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \text{Sum}
\]

Substituting \(k \approx 0.0362 \, \text{fm}^{-1}\) and \(\text{Sum} \approx 9.101\):

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{0.0362} \cdot 9.101 \approx 27.62 \cdot 9.101 \approx 251.2 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately **251.2 fm**, which matches option **D**.
