Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this metric problem. The question gives a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about metrics and pseudospheres.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can sometimes represent different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on their form. Oh right, the form of the metric can tell us about the geometry of the space.

So, the general form I remember for a sphere is something like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²/R²)), or maybe for a pseudosphere, which is a hyperbolic space, it's a bit different. Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature, right? And their metrics often involve hyperbolic functions or something similar.

Wait, but the given metric is in terms of x and y coordinates, not r and θ. So maybe it's written in isothermal coordinates or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a flat space but with a conformal factor. Let me think.

Looking at the metric more carefully, it's ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). The denominator here, 4 - x² - y², suggests that this is valid where 4 - x² - y² is positive because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, which might lead to issues.

So the condition 4 - x² - y² > 0 implies that x² + y² < 4. That defines a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the domain of this metric is the interior of a circle with radius 2. Wait, but pseudospheres have infinite areas, don't they? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its area is finite, right? Or wait, maybe I'm confusing it with other models. Oh, wait, the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space has an infinite area even though it's represented in a finite disk. Because the metric is conformal, and the scaling factor goes to infinity at the boundary.

So in this case, the metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model. The standard Poincaré disk metric is usually written as ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. But here, the given metric is in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's written in Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, the given metric is in 2D, right? Because it's ds² = ... (dx² + dy²). So this is a 2D metric. So the space described here is a 2D hyperbolic space, i.e., a pseudosphere. Because the Poincaré disk model is a representation of hyperbolic plane, which is a 2D space with constant negative curvature.

So the question is, what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2? Wait, no, wait, the radius here is a bit confusing. The radius in the metric usually refers to the curvature radius. In hyperbolic geometry, the curvature is negative, and the radius is related to the absolute value of the curvature. So for a hyperbolic plane with curvature -1/(a²), the radius is a.

In the Poincaré disk model, the radius of the disk is usually set as the same as the radius of curvature. So for example, if the curvature is -1, the Poincaré disk has radius 1. So in this problem, perhaps the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which at the boundary is 4, so the radius of the disk is 2. So the curvature would be related to that. But how does that affect the area of the pseudosphere? Wait, the pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic space, but I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being asked.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So the pseudosphere has radius 2, which probably corresponds to the radius of the disk in the Poincaré model. So the area of the entire hyperbolic plane (pseudosphere) would be infinite because it's an unbounded space, but represented as a finite disk in the model. Oh wait, no, the standard hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but the Poincaré disk model maps it into a finite space.

But wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented inside a unit disk, and the area of the hyperbolic plane is still infinite. Because the metric scales with a factor that goes to infinity as you approach the boundary. So the area integral would diverge.

Wait, let me think about the area. The area of the hyperbolic plane (pseudosphere) isn't finite. Wait, no, that's not right. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area. So the question is, what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, perhaps the term 'pseudosphere' here refers to a specific object, maybe a finite area. Or maybe I'm confusing terms. Alternatively, perhaps this is a 2D surface, and the area is being asked.

Let me think about the metric again. The metric given is for a 2D space. The area can be computed by integrating the area element over the entire space. The area element in this metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

In this case, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is the product of the diagonal components. The diagonal components are both 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. Therefore, the area element dA is |det g|^(1/2) dx dy = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, no, sqrt(g) is the square root of the determinant. So sqrt(g) would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)), since the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

So to find the total area, we need to integrate this over all x and y such that x² + y² <4. So the integral becomes ∫∫ (32/(4 - r²)) dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angular coordinate. Wait, because x² + y² = r², so the denominator is 4 - r², and we can switch to polar coordinates.

So the integral is from r=0 to r=2, θ from 0 to 2π.

Thus, the area A = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Breaking this into angular and radial parts:

A = [∫0^{2π} dθ ] * [∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ]

The angular integral is 2π, so A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr. So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (du)/u.

Which is -16 ∫ du/u. The limits: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So substituting the limits:

-16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this becomes -16 ( -∞ - ln4 ) = -16 ( -∞ ) which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges to positive infinity.

So the area is infinite. So the answer should be D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric represents a 2D hyperbolic space, specifically the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the domain of the metric is the interior of a circle with radius \(2\) in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane, i.e., \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\), which diverges as \(x^2 + y^2 \to 4\).

To compute the total area of the space described by this metric, we calculate the area element \(dA\), which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the entire domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos \theta\), \(y = r \sin \theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so the total area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2} du}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
-16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0 = -16 \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the total area of the space described by the metric is infinite.

The correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
