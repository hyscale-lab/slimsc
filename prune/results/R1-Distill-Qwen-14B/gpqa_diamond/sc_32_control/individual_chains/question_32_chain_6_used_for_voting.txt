Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Next, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy formula, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (mc²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but the question is asking for the energy of the collider. So I think that refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, in particle physics, often when they talk about the energy of a collider, they refer to the kinetic energy each particle has. But wait, sometimes it might be the total energy. I'll need to clarify this point.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're all in the GeV range. Let me think. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6 atomic mass units (since each nucleon is about 1 u). Converting that to energy using E=mc². 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 ≈ 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. 

Wait, but the options are all around 20 GeV or less. So maybe the energy given is the kinetic energy? Because the total energy would be way higher. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.

The question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So RHIC accelerates ions to high speeds, and the energy they're referring to is perhaps the kinetic energy each ion has. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be the total relativistic energy. I'll have to figure that out.

So, first, calculating gamma. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). v is 0.96c. Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714... Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is actually 3.57142857... So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the rest mass energy (mc²) for the Li-6 nucleus is as I calculated, about 5.589 GeV. So the total energy would be gamma * mc². So 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV ≈ Let's compute that.

3.5714 * 5.589. Let's break it down. 3 * 5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 * 5.589 ≈ around 3.195. Adding them gives about 19.962 GeV, approximately 20 GeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, maybe I'm not precise enough in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's calculate sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So that's precise. 

So the total energy E is gamma * m c². So E = 3.57142857 * 5.589 GeV. Let me compute that more accurately.

5.589 GeV * 3.57142857 = Let's compute step by step.

5.589 * 3 = 16.767

5.589 * 0.57142857 ≈ Let's compute 5.589 * 0.5 = 2.7945, and 5.589 * 0.07142857 ≈ approximately 0.400. So together, about 3.1945.

So adding 16.767 + 3.1945 = 19.9615 GeV. So approximately 19.96 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me double-check. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units. Because natural abundance is mostly Li-7, but Li-6 is about 7.59% abundant. So the exact mass might be important.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 u. So m = 6.017 u. 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.017 * 931.5 MeV = Let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.
0.017 * 931.5 = approx 15.8355 MeV.
So total is 5589 +15.8355 ≈ 5604.8355 MeV, which is 5.6048355 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.6048 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.6048 GeV.

Calculating that:

3.57142857 * 5.6048:

Let me compute 3 * 5.6048 = 16.8144.

0.57142857 * 5.6048.

0.5 * 5.6048 = 2.8024.

0.07142857 *5.6048 ≈ approx 0.401.

So 2.8024 + 0.401 = 3.2034.

Adding up 16.8144 + 3.2034 = 20.0178 GeV.

So approximately 20.018 GeV. Hmm, the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Wait, 20.018 is closest to option C (20.132), but a bit under. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because the total energy includes the rest mass, which would be significant. Let's see.

Kinetic energy (K) is E = gamma m c² - m c² = (gamma -1) m c².

So for K, we have (3.5714 - 1) *5.6048 GeV = (2.5714) *5.6048 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.5714 *5.6048.

Let me do this more precisely.

2 *5.6048 = 11.2096.

0.5714 *5.6048 ≈ 0.5714 *5 =2.857, 0.5714*0.6048≈ ~0.345. So total ~3.202.

So 11.2096 + 3.202 = 14.4116 GeV.

But the options don't have around 14 GeV. So probably the question is about the total energy.

Wait, maybe I messed up the miscalculation. Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6048 exactly.

3.5714 *5.6048.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.6048 =16.8144.

0.5714 *5.6048 = ?

Compute 0.5 *5.6048 =2.8024.

0.0714 *5.6048 ≈ 0.4013.

So total 2.8024 +0.4013 =3.2037.

So 16.8144 +3.2037 =20.0181 GeV.

So E is approximately 20.018 GeV, which is about 20.018 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute v=0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714... So that part is correct.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6048 GeV precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6048 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6048 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0048 = 0.01714119.

Adding those: 2.142857142 +0.01714119 ≈2.16.

So 3.57142857 *5.6048 =17.85714285 + 2.16= 20.01714285 GeV.

Approximately 20.017 GeV.

But the answer option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a difference of about 0.115 GeV. Maybe I need to consider more precise values for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is not 6.017 u. Let me check. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0173 u. So m c² is 6.0173 *931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV, 0.0173 *931.5 ≈16.06 MeV. So total is 5605.06 MeV, which is 5.60506 GeV.

So m c² is 5.60506 GeV. Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.60506.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60506.

Let me compute 3 *5.60506 =16.81518.

0.57142857 *5.60506.

0.5 *5.60506 =2.80253.

0.07142857 *5.60506 ≈ approx 0.4016.

So 2.80253 +0.4016 =3.20413.

Adding to 16.81518 gives 20.0193 GeV.

So approximately 20.0193 GeV. So about 20.019 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.113 GeV higher. Hmm. Or perhaps I need to check if I'm using the correct mass.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy. Let's recalculate the kinetic energy.

K = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma -1 is 2.57142857.

Multiply by 5.60506 GeV:

2.57142857 *5.60506.

2 *5.60506 =11.21012.

0.57142857 *5.60506 ≈3.2036.

Adding gives 14.4137 GeV. But none of the options match this, so probably not kinetic energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass as 6.0 u exactly, not 6.017. Let's try that.

So m c² =6.0 *931.5 =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Then E =3.57142857 *5.589 =3.57142857 *5.589.

Compute 3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589= 3.195.

Total: 16.767 +3.195=19.962 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.962 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132, which is a bit higher. But perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the entire ion, including electrons. Wait, no, in particle physics, when dealing with heavy ions, they usually consider the nucleus as a whole, without the electrons. So the rest mass is that of the nucleus, not the atom. So Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so A=6, mass number 6.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the correct formula is considering the energy per nucleon? No, the question specifies the nucleus X, so I think it's the nucleus as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not non-relativistic, so we have to consider the relativistic mass. But wait, in relativity, mass increases, so the effective mass is gamma times the rest mass. So the energy would be the total energy, which is what we've been calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise approach, instead of approximating sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma using more precise steps.

v =0.96c

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c²

1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. That's correct. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So I don't think that's the problem.

Another thing: perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed. Like, maybe the speed is 0.96c, but perhaps it's the beta in terms of the speed, so beta = v/c = 0.96. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy is in per nucleon basis. But the question says nucleus X, so that's the whole nucleus. So each nucleus has 6 nucleons, but the energy is for the whole nucleus.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is about the rest energy multiplied by gamma. So perhaps I've done that already.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the total energy (gamma m c²) and the options are given with higher precision. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.60506 GeV.

Let me do this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.60506

Breaking it down:

3 *5.60506 =16.81518

0.57142857 *5.60506:

Let me compute 0.5 *5.60506 =2.80253.

0.07142857 *5.60506.

Compute 5.60506 * 0.07 = 0.3923542.

5.60506 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.007995.

So adding those: 0.3923542 +0.007995 ≈0.400349.

So 0.57142857 *5.60506 ≈2.80253 +0.400349 =3.202879.

So total E =16.81518 +3.202879 =20.018059 GeV.

So E ≈20.018 GeV. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Looking up the exact atomic mass of Li-6: according to sources, the atomic mass is approximately 6.0173 u (atomic mass units). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass or something else. But I don't think so because the nucleus is much more massive than individual nucleons, and RHIC accelerates the entire nucleus.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy with higher precision.

Wait, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.60506 GeV.

3.57142857 is 25/7. Because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.60506 = ?

25/7 = 3.57142857.

Compute 5.60506 *25 =140.1265, then divide by 7.

140.1265 /7 =20.01807 GeV.

So exactly, it's 20.01807 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the miscalculation is in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think. Wait, perhaps the mass is not 6.0173 u but higher. Let me think about the exact value.

Wait, another point: the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0173 u, but the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the atomic mass because the atomic mass includes electrons. The nucleus has 3 protons, which are in the nucleus, while the electrons are separate. So, to find the mass of the nucleus, I need to subtract the mass of the electrons.

Wait, that's a good point. Because the nucleus is only the protons and neutrons. So the atomic mass is nucleus plus electrons. So if it's Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons (in neutral atom), so the nucleus would be Li-6 minus the electrons.

Wait, but wait! No, wait. The atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes the nucleus plus the electrons. So when we talk about the rest mass of the nucleus, we have to subtract the mass of the electrons.

But wait, when the nucleus is moving at high speed, the electrons are not part of it. So the rest mass of the nucleus is (atomic mass) minus (mass of electrons).

So, Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u.

So the mass of the nucleus is 6.0173 u (atomic mass) - 0.00164574 u =6.015654 u.

So the rest mass energy is 6.015654 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015654 *931.5 MeV =approx 0.015654 *900=14.0886, plus 0.015654 *31.5=0.49341. So total ≈14.0886 +0.49341=14.582 MeV.

So total m c² is 5589 +14.582=5603.582 MeV=5.603582 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603582 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.603582.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603582=16.810746.

0.57142857 *5.603582.

0.5 *5.603582=2.801791.

0.07142857 *5.603582≈0.4007.

So 2.801791 +0.4007=3.202491.

Adding to 16.810746 gives 20.013237 GeV.

So approximately 20.0132 GeV. Hmm, that's still about 20.013 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.119 GeV higher. So why the difference?

Wait, maybe I need to compute the exact value without approximations. Let me use precise calculations.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.603582:

3.57142857 =25/7.

So 25/7 *5.603582= (25 *5.603582)/7.

25 *5.603582 = 25*5=125, 25*0.603582=15.08955. So total 125+15.08955=140.08955.

Divide by7: 140.08955 /7=20.012792857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0128 GeV.

The options are:

A) 18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

So 20.0128 is closest to option C (20.132), but there's a difference of about 0.119 GeV. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Another possibility: the speed is 0.96c, but the calculation is done with beta =v/c=0.96, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact gamma using more precise methods.

Wait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 is 0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, but the options are referring to the kinetic energy. Let me calculate the kinetic energy again.

K = (gamma -1) * m c².

gamma-1 =2.57142857.

m c² =5.603582 GeV.

So K=2.57142857 *5.603582.

2.57142857 *5.603582.

Let me compute that.

2 *5.603582=11.207164.

0.57142857 *5.603582.

0.5 *5.603582=2.801791.

0.07142857 *5.603582≈0.4007.

So 2.801791 +0.4007=3.202491.

So K=11.207164 +3.202491=14.409655 GeV.

So K≈14.4097 GeV.

But the options aren't near that, so I think it's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy without the electrons. But I already accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I subtracted the electrons' mass, but perhaps I shouldn't? Because the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, which have their own masses.

Wait, the atomic mass includes the nucleus and electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So yes, I did that correctly.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the mass is taken from the periodic table, which is the atomic mass, not the nuclear mass. So maybe the question doesn't subtract the electrons' mass, and just uses the atomic mass.

In that case, the mass would be 6.0173 u, giving m c²=6.0173 *931.5 MeV=5.605 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.605=20.017 GeV.

Same as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing some factor, like the charge or something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon. No, the question says the nucleus X, so it's the entire nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact mass, including binding energy. But that's getting complicated, and I think the problem expects a simpler approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy per nucleus, and I'm using the correct approach, but the multiple-choice options have a typo.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. My calculation is 20.017 GeV. So a difference of about 0.115 GeV. That's about 115 MeV. That's a significant difference, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60506 GeV again.

3.57142857 *5.60506.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60506 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60506 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00506 ≈0.0180857.

So 2.142857142 +0.0180857=2.1609428.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.1609428=20.01808565 GeV.

Hmm, 20.018 GeV. Still, not matching any option.

But wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is a bit higher because when I calculated sqrt(0.0784), I assumed it's exactly 0.28, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216. So 1-0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784.

Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

Well, 0.28^2=0.0784. So it is exactly 0.28.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the speed is 0.96c, and I'm using relativistic equations correctly. But perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rest mass of a single nucleon, not the entire nucleus. Because each nucleon would have a rest mass of about 0.938 GeV/c².

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think.

If the nucleus is composed of 6 nucleons (3 protons +3 neutrons), each with rest mass ~0.938 GeV.

Total rest mass would be 6 *0.938=5.628 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628= approx 3.210.

So total E=20.094 GeV.

That's closer to option C, 20.132 GeV.

But wait, why would the question consider each nucleon separately? Because the nucleus as a whole has a rest mass, which is a bit less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy.

Wait, but the binding energy is usually a small fraction of the total mass. So perhaps using the sum of individual nucleons is a rough approximation, but the exact value would be a bit less.

If I proceed with the sum of individual nucleons:

Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons: 6 *0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.628 GeV=3.57142857 *5.628.

3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628 =0.5 *5.628=2.814, 0.07142857 *5.628≈0.402.

So 2.814 +0.402=3.216.

Total E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV. That would make sense.

So perhaps the question is using each nucleon's rest mass (summing them) rather than the actual nucleus rest mass.

But why would they do that? Because the actual nucleus has a lower rest mass due to binding energy. So perhaps the problem expects this approach.

So, using the sum of nucleon masses (which is an overestimation of the actual rest mass), the total energy would be 3.5714 *5.628 GeV≈20.1 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

So I think the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X (Li-6) is 0.96c, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the nucleus**: Lithium-6 (Li-6) has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a mass number \( A = 6 \). Its atomic mass is approximately \( 6.0173 \, \text{u} \).

2. **Relativistic energy formula**: The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the particle, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

3. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**: For \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
   \]

4. **Rest mass energy of Li-6**: The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.0173 \, \text{u} \). Converting to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
   \[
   m c^2 = 6.0173 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5.605 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

5. **Total energy**: Substituting \( \gamma \) and \( m c^2 \) into the energy formula:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.605 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.018 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

6. **Refinement**: To match the options, consider the possibility that the problem approximates the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleon masses. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately \( 0.938 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). For Li-6 (6 nucleons):
   \[
   m c^2 = 6 \times 0.938 \, \text{GeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
   \]
   Recomputing the total energy:
   \[
   E = 3.5714 \times 5.628 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.1 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

7. **Comparison with options**: The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**.

Thus, the energy of the RHIC for Li-6 nuclei moving at \( 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.
