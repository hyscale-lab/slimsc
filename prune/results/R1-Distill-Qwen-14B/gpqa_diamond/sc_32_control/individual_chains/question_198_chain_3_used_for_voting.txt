Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. We're given the concentrations of Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) in a solution. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are involved in complex formation. Each β represents the formation constant for a complex with a certain number of ligands. So, β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing. I thought usually the stability constants increase as the number of ligands increase, but here β4 is lower than β3. Maybe it's possible for a higher complex to dissociate back to a lower one if the β values aren't as high, but I'm not sure.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. I think the first step is to consider the different possible complexes that can form with Co(II) and SCN-.

So, Co(II) can form complexes with varying numbers of thiocyanate ions. The complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n- where n can be 1, 2, 3, 4. Each of these has a different stability constant.

The overall approach, I think, is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum them up. But since we need the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^(?), wait, the term 'dithiocyanato' usually implies two SCN- ligands. So I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ions. So that's the β2 complex.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ions. So the complex [Co(SCN)₂]^something. So the β2 is the stability constant for Co(SCN)₂^2+? Or perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(3-n), considering Co is +2. Each SCN is -1, so for [Co(SCN)_n]^(3−n), the charge would be 2+ −n*(−1) = 2 + n−? Wait, no. Let me think: Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So, the complex charge would be 2 + (n*(-1)) = 2 - n. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the formula for the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So the total charge is 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So for n=1, the charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But I'm not sure if the charge matters for the stability constants. I think the stability constants relate to the formation from the ions, regardless of charge, but perhaps the given β values are for the respective complexes.

Now, to find the fraction of each complex, we can model the system using the stability constants. The approach is to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations relative to the free Co²+.

But given the concentrations, perhaps we can use the method where we find the fraction of each complex. The fraction of each complex is given by βn * [SCN^-]^n divided by the sum over all n of (βn * [SCN^-]^n).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The general approach is that the concentration of each complex is proportional to βn multiplied by [SCN-]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms for n=0 to 4. Wait, but [Co] is the total concentration, which is the sum of all free Co²+ and all the complexes.

Wait, wait. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all complexes plus the free Co²+.

But the problem says total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So, [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃] + [Co(SCN)₄] = 1e-2 M.

But the way stability constants work is that they represent the stepwise formation of complexes. So, the formation is cumulative. So, the concentrations are related by the β values.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model using the fraction of each species.

The formation of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n

But since the total Co is [Co²+] + sum of [Co(SCN)_n] for n=1-4, it's a bit complicated.

But perhaps since the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration (1e-2 M), the solution is SCN- rich. So, the complexes with higher n are more favored, but the β values might determine which is dominant.

Wait, but the β values don't all increase with n. β3 is 63, which is the highest, followed by β2=40, β1=9, β4=16. So, β3 is the highest, then β2, then β4, and β1 is lower.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, the third complex Co(SCN)3^-1 has the highest stability constant, β3=63. Then β2=40, β4=16, β1=9.

So, the complexes form in the order: Co(SCN)3 is the most stable, followed by Co(SCN)2, then Co(SCN)4, and the least is Co(SCN).

But wait, that's assuming that higher βn implies more stability. But for each βn, it's the equilibrium constant for the nth step. So, βn = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co(SCN)_{n-1}][SCN^-])

Hmm, but what's the order in which the complexes form? Typically, the most stable complex is the one with the highest overall stability, which is the sum of βn for each step. But wait, each βn is a stepwise constant, not the overall. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, each βn is the formation constant for the nth ion. For example:

β1 is the constant for Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ (n=1)

β2 is the constant for CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₂^0 (n=2)

β3 is for Co(SCN)₂^0 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)3^-1

β4 is for Co(SCN)3^-1 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)4^-2

So, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1, β2, ..., βn.

Wait, but wait, no. The overall constant K for Co(SCN)_n would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So, the overall K for n=4 is K4 = β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, because each βn is the formation constant for the nth ligand. So the overall K for n=4 is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

So, for each complex, the overall formation constant is the product of the β's up to that n.

So, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_1]^+ is β1 = 9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, it's β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, it's 9 *40 *63= 22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^-2, it's 9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think. Each step adds a ligand, so the overall K is the product of each step's β.

Yes, because each step is a separate equilibrium.

So, the product gives the overall K for the formation of each complex.

So, the levels:

n=1: K1=9

n=2: K2=9*40=360

n=3: K3=9*40*63=22680

n=4: K4=9*40*63*16=362880

So, K4 is the largest. So, the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the one with two SCN- ligands. So, that's the n=2 complex.

So, the fraction of each complex can be determined based on their overall K values and the ligand concentration.

Wait, but another approach is to assume that the concentrations of the complexes are proportional to their K_n multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

Because for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * [Co²+] * [SCN^-]^n.

But [Co²+] is the same for all, so the ratio of [Co(SCN)_n] to [Co(SCN)_m] is K_n/K_m * [SCN^-]^(n-m).

Wait, but considering the total Co concentration, which is the sum of all species including Co²+ and the complexes, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the situation as:

The distribution of Co species is determined by the ligand concentration and the stability constants. Since SCN- is in excess (0.1 M), the complexes may form, but we need to see how much of each forms.

But another approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co²+.

The fraction of each complex is (K_n [SCN-]^n) / (1 + sum (K_m [SCN-]^m) for m=1 to 4 )

Because the concentration of each complex is K_n [Co²+][SCN-]^n, and the free Co²+ is [Co²+] = [Co²+] + sum (K_m [Co²+][SCN-]^m )

Wait, but this might not be correct. Let me think again.

The total Co concentration is the sum of all species:

[Co_total] = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^-2.

But [CoSCN]^+ = K1 [Co²+][SCN-]

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = K2 [Co²+][SCN-]^2

[Co(SCN)3]^- = K3 [Co²+][SCN-]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^-2 = K4 [Co²+][SCN-]^4

So, [Co_total] = [Co²+] + K1 [Co²+][S] + K2 [Co²+][S]^2 + K3 [Co²+][S]^3 + K4 [Co²+][S]^4.

We can factor out [Co²+], so:

[Co_total] = [Co²+] * (1 + K1 S + K2 S² + K3 S³ + K4 S^4 )

But [Co_total] is given as 1e-2 M, so [Co²+] = (1e-2) / (1 + K1 S + K2 S² + K3 S^3 + K4 S^4 )

Wait, but S is [SCN-], which is 0.1 M.

So, substituting K1=β1=9, K2=β1β2=360, K3=β1β2β3=22680, K4=β1β2β3β4=362880.

And S = 0.1.

Let me compute each term:

K1 S = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

K2 S² = 360 * (0.1)^2 =360 * 0.01=3.6

K3 S^3=22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68

K4 S^4=362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

So, adding all these up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So, denominator is 64.468.

Thus, [Co²+] = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Wait, but wait, that's the concentration of free Co²+.

Now, the fraction of each complex is given by (K_n S^n) / denominator.

So, the fraction for each complex is (K_n S^n) / (sum of K_m S^m from m=0 to 4 )

Wait, but K0 is 1 (for m=0, which is [Co²+]), so the denominator is (1 + K1 S + K2 S² + K3 S^3 + K4 S^4 ) = 64.468.

So, the fraction for each complex is (K_n S^n) / 64.468.

So, let's compute each:

n=1: (K1 S) = 0.9 → fraction = 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.014, or 1.4%

n=2: K2 S²=3.6 → 3.6/64.468 ≈0.0556, ~5.56%

n=3: 22.68 → 22.68/64.468 ≈0.3518, ~35.18%

n=4:36.288 →36.288/64.468≈0.5629, ~56.3%

Wait, but wait, the sum of these fractions should add up to (0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) /64.468 = (63.568)/64.468 ≈0.986, so 98.6% of the Co is in complexes. The remaining is [Co²+] at 1.55e-4 M, which is about 1.55e-4 /1e-2 =0.0155, or 1.55%.

So, the fractions are:

n=0: ~1.55%

n=1: ~1.4%

n=2: ~5.56%

n=3: ~35.18%

n=4: ~56.3%

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I thought is n=2. So that's about 5.56%?

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%. So 5.56% is not among them. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the K values. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, no, the confusion might be whether the β values are the overall K or the stepwise K. Oh wait, the given β's are the stepwise stability constants. So, the overall K for each complex is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the way the problem states the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, etc., which are the stepwise constants. So, for the second complex, β2 is 40, and the overall K for n=2 is K1 * K2 = 9 *40=360.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I used K1=β1, K2=β1*β2, etc., which is correct.

Wait, but then according to the fractions, the majority of the Co is in the n=4 complex, then n=3, then n=2, etc.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that's ~5.5% as per my earlier calculation. But the options don't have that. So, probably I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the β values are for the overall formation constants or the stepwise. Alternatively, perhaps the way the fractions are calculated is incorrect.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering log β, but no, the β values are given as 9, 40, etc.

Wait, another approach is to compute the fraction of each species as (βn * [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of βm [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, because βn for each complex is the stepwise constant, so for the complex [Co(SCN)_n], the concentration is βn [Co(SCN)_{n-1}][SCN^-]

But [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] can be expressed in terms of [Co²+], which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 (βm [SCN^-]^m) )

But then, does that account for all species?

Wait, maybe not because each [Co(SCN)_n] is formed from [Co(SCN)_{n-1}} and SCN-. So, the βn's are stepwise, and the concentration of each complex is βn * [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] * [SCN^-]

But this leads to a complex of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are calculated using:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN^-]^k )

But with β0=1.

So, for each n, the numerator is the product of β1 to βn multiplied by S^n.

So, for:

n=0: 1 * S^0 = 1

n=1: β1 * S^1 =9 * 0.1=0.9

n=2: β1 β2 S^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6

n=3:9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001=22.68

n=4: 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Then, sum all these: 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

So, the fraction for each n is given by (β1...βn S^n) /64.468.

So, for n=2, that's 3.6 /64.468≈0.0556 or 5.56%.

But the options are all higher than this. So, I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as the one with two SCN- per formula unit. But perhaps in this case, the dithiocyanato is a different complex, perhaps n=3 or another n.

Alternatively, maybe I've confused the order of the complexes. Let me think: when n=2, the complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

Wait, but maybe the dithiocyanato complex is a different one, perhaps the one with four SCN- ions? No, dithiocyanato would be two.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the tetrahedral or another structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are calculated differently.

Wait, another thought. The problem says 'the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution'.

Wait, perhaps the complex [Co(SCN)(en)] is blue, but no, the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the percentage is about 5.56%, which is nowhere near the given options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given as conditional formation constants, or perhaps the [SCN^-] is not considering the complexation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fraction of each complex is given by (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 βm [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, that would be the same as the previous approach.

So, sum of (βm [SCN^-]^m) = 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=63.568. Adding 1 gives 64.568.

So, fraction for n=2 is 3.6/64.568= approx 5.56%. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the given β values are for the overall complexes, not stepwise. Oh, that's a possibility. That would change everything.

So, if the β values are the overall formation constants for each complex, that is:

β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-1, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^-2.

But no, that's not how stability constants are defined. Typically, β is a stepwise constant. But perhaps the problem gives the overall constants for each complex.

Wait, the problem says, "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16".

Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Because, if it's the stepwise βn, then earlier approach holds. But if they are the overall K for each complex, the approach is different.

If β1 is the overall formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc., then the fractions would be based on these βn.

Wait, but that seems unlikely because the stepwise constants are more common. But perhaps I should consider this possibility.

So, let's assume that β1 is K1=9, β2 is K2=40, β3 is K3=63, and β4 is K4=16.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because K4 should be larger than K3 if the complexes are progressively more stable, but here K4=16 is less than K3=63.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps it's possible. So, if K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but with K4 lower than K3, the [Co(SCN)4]^-2 would be less favored than [Co(SCN)3]^-1.

So, the dominant species might be [Co(SCN)3]^-1.

So, in this case, the fractions would be based on each K_n multiplied by [SCN-]^n, divided by the sum.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co]^2+ [SCN-]^n.

The total cobalt is [Co]^2+ + sum [Co(SCN)_n]

So, [Co_total] = [Co²+] + K1 [Co²+][S] + K2 [Co²+][S]^2 + K3 [Co²+][S]^3 + K4 [Co²+][S]^4.

Factor out [Co²+]: [Co_total] = [Co²+] (1 + K1 S + K2 S^2 + K3 S^3 + K4 S^4 )

So, [Co²+] = [Co_total] / (1 + K1 S + K2 S^2 + K3 S^3 + K4 S^4 )

Given [Co_total] =1e-2 M, S=0.1.

Compute each term:

K1 S =9 *0.1=0.9

K2 S^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

K3 S^3=63 *0.001=0.063

K4 S^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 0.9 +0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

So denominator is 1 +1.3646=2.3646.

Thus, [Co²+] =1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

Wait, that's a higher [Co²+] than before, but let's proceed.

Now, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total] = (K_n S^n) / (sum (K_m S^m) +1 )

Wait, sum (K_m S^m) for m=1-4 is 1.3646, as before.

So, for each n:

n=1: K1 S =0.9 → fraction =0.9 /2.3646≈0.38 or 38%.

n=2: K2 S^2=0.4 → 0.4/2.3646≈17%.

n=3: K3 S^3=0.063 → 0.063/2.3646≈2.66%.

n=4: K4 S^4=0.0016 →0.0016/2.3646≈0.067%.

So, the fractions are:

n=1: ~38%

n=2: ~17%

n=3: ~2.66%

n=4: ~0.067%

Plus the free Co²+ at [Co²+] =4.226e-3 M. So, [Co²+] / [Co_total] =4.226e-3 /1e-2=0.4226, which is 42.26%.

So, the fractions are:

n=0:42.26%

n=1:38%

n=2:17%

n=3:2.66%

n=4:0.067%

Wait, but wait a second. The sum of these fractions is 42.26 +38 +17 +2.66 +0.067 ≈100%, which makes sense.

So, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue complex is n=2 (dithiocyanato), then its fraction is 17%, which is option D is 16.9% which is close. But in our calculation, it's 17%, so option D is correct.

Wait, but in this scenario, the β values are the overall K for each complex.

But earlier I thought the β's were stepwise, but perhaps they're given as overall K's. That would change the result.

So, the answer would be approximately 17%, which is option D:16.9%.

But let me double-check the math.

Sum of K_n S^n:

n=1:9*0.1=0.9

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=0.4

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=0.063

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=0.0016

Sum of these is 0.9+0.4=1.3 +0.063=1.363 +0.0016=1.3646.

Denominator:1 +1.3646=2.3646.

So, for n=2, fraction is 0.4/2.3646= 0.4/(≈2.3646)= approximately 0.169, so 16.9%, which matches option D.

So, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the given stability constants and concentrations. The stability constants provided are interpreted as the overall formation constants for each complex, meaning:

- β₁ = 9 corresponds to [Co(SCN)]⁺  
- β₂ = 40 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂]⁰  
- β₃ = 63 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₃]⁻  
- β₄ = 16 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻  

The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{m=1}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

Here, \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), and the denominator accounts for all possible cobalt species, including the free Co²⁺ ion.

### Step 1: Calculate the terms in the denominator
For each \( n \), compute \( \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \):
- \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
- \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{m=1}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
\]

Adding 1 for the free Co²⁺:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of each complex
The fraction of each complex is given by:
\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

- For \( n = 1 \):  
  \[
  f_1 = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.38 \, (38\%)
  \]

- For \( n = 2 \):  
  \[
  f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (16.9\%)
  \]

- For \( n = 3 \):  
  \[
  f_3 = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%)
  \]

- For \( n = 4 \):  
  \[
  f_4 = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.00067 \, (0.067\%)
  \]

### Step 3: Interpret the results
The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to \( n = 2 \), which has a fraction of approximately \( 16.9\% \). This matches option D.

ANSWER: D
