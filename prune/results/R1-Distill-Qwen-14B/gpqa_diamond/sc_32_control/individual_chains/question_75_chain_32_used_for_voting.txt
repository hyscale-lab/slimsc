Okay, so I'm trying to help solve this problem about why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed. Let me read through the question again and try to understand what's going on.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed under an inducible promoter. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To do this, they're modifying the gene by adding the sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They then transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and select for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, the protein isn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the options, the problem must be in the construct they designed. They provided the plus strand sequence of the construct. Let me look at that sequence.

Hmm, the sequence starts with 5' ATG... which is the start codon, methionine. So that's good. Then, the next codons would code for the hemagglutinin tag, followed by GADD45G. But perhaps there's an issue in the construct design.

The question says that the problem is in the sequence. Let me think about possible issues. Why might the protein not be expressed?

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That could cause the protein to be incorrectly tagged, maybe leading to improper folding or degradation. But the question is about overexpression, so if the tag is wrong, perhaps the antibody can't bind, making affinity purification difficult. But the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed in the first place.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. How would that happen? If there's a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the sequence. Let's check if the provided DNA has any in-frame stop codons before the end.

Looking at the DNA strand: the coding sequence starts with ATG. Let me translate the mRNA into amino acids to see if any stop codons appear early.

Wait, the DNA is given as the plus strand, which is the same as the coding strand. When transcribed into mRNA, the template would be the complementary strand. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand but with T's replaced by U's.

So looking for UAA, UAG, UGA in the mRNA. Let me see.

Looking through the sequence:

Starting from the beginning:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC A... Hmm, let's translate a few codons.

ATG is Met.

TAC is Tyr.

CCA is Pro.

TAC is Tyr.

GAT is Asp.

GTT is Val.

CCA is Pro.

GAT is Asp.

TAC is Tyr.

GCC is Ala.

AAT is Asn.

GCT is Ala.

...

Wait, looking for any triplet that is UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Wait, looking at the DNA sequence, the plasmid is the coding strand. So any in-frame TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA would be a stop codon in the mRNA.

So let's scan the DNA for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking through the sequence:

Start at ATG...

Looking for TGA... Let me scan.

Looking at the sequence:

...GATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, at the very end, it's ...TGA. Wait, looking at the last part:

...CAGTGA.

So the last codons are GAGTGA. Wait, the last part is ...CGAGTGA.

Wait, the DNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the same, but U instead of T.

So in the mRNA, the sequence would end with ...GAG UGA.

Wait, that's a problem. Because UGA is a stop codon. So the construct has a UGA in the coding sequence, which would terminate translation early.

So the ribosome would reach this UGA and stop, producing a truncated protein. So the protein isn't overexpressed because the stop codon is present in the coding sequence.

So in the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That fits.

Wait, but let me check if there's any other stop codons earlier. Let me go through the sequence.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Looking at the middle parts:

...CGATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAA...

Wait, I see CGATG, which is CGA (Arg) and T G... Hmm, not a stop.

Further up, looking for any TGA or TAG.

Another point: near the middle, after the HA tag, perhaps.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence has a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. The construct is the coding sequence of GADD45G with HA tag.

So the HA tag would have a certain number of amino acids, then followed by the GADD45G sequence.

If the HA sequence is correctly added, the coding DNA for HA would be before the GADD45G's own coding sequence.

In the given DNA, the start is ATG, so the HA coding sequence is part of this.

Wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence, perhaps like YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA would code for that. Let me count the codons.

Wait, but perhaps during the cloning, the HA sequence was introduced with a frame shift or a stop codon.

Wait, looking at the beginning of the DNA:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Wait, did I spot a TGA earlier? Let me check again.

Looking for any TGA in the sequence.

Looking quickly:

- The first part: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So in the DNA, the last three nucleotides before the end are TGA, which in the mRNA would be UGA. So the last codon is UGA, a stop. That's a problem because it would terminate translation prematurely.

So the construct ends with a stop codon, meaning the protein would stop at that point, making it shorter than expected. So the transgene is introducing a stop codon in its coding sequence, which is causing the protein not to be expressed correctly.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That's correct because of the UGA stop codon in the mRNA.

Alternatively, could it be option D? D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in mouse. But in the DNA construct, the stop codon is UGA, not UAA. So D doesn't apply.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the protein is being made but degraded, that's a possibility, but the problem is that the protein isn't expressed at all. The question says they couldn't overexpress as expected. If the construct has a stop codon, the protein isn't made properly. So C might not be the issue.

Option A: the HA sequence has a missense. That would affect the tag, but the main issue is the protein isn't expressed. If the HA tag has a mutation, the construct might be expressed but the tag is bad, but the problem here is the lack of expression.

So the correct answer is B: the ribosome terminated early due to an in-frame stop codon (UGA).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct is analyzed to identify the issue.

The DNA sequence starts with the start codon `ATG` and includes the coding sequence for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. A critical observation is that the sequence ends with `...GAGTGA`. In the mRNA, this corresponds to `...GAG UGA`, where `UGA` is a stop codon. This stop codon appears in the middle of the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. As a result, the full-length protein is not produced, leading to the lack of overexpression.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA tag sequence could affect the tag's functionality, but the issue here is the lack of protein expression, not the tag's integrity. This option does not explain the problem.
- **Option B:** The presence of the `UGA` stop codon in the mRNA sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein. This aligns with the observed lack of full-length protein expression.
- **Option C:** Proteolysis due to the lack of a linker sequence would occur if the protein were produced but degraded. However, the issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all, making this option unlikely.
- **Option D:** The absence of a tRNA for the `UAA` codon is irrelevant because the stop codon in the construct is `UGA`, not `UAA`.

The most plausible explanation is that the `UGA` stop codon in the construct causes premature termination of translation, preventing proper expression of the GADD45G protein.

**Answer: B**
