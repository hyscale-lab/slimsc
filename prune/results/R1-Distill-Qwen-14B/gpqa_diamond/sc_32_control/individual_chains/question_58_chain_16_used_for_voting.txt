Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. But wait, what's regularization exactly? Oh right, it's a way to make sense of those divergent integrals by introducing a cutoff or some other method to regulate the infinities temporarily, allowing you to compute things and then take the cutoff to infinity again in the end.

The question is asking which of the theories never needs regularization. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option. 

First, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory dealing with electrons and photons. I remember that QED has been very successful, but it does have issues with divergent loop diagrams, especially in higher-order calculations. So they must use regularization to handle these infinities. For example, the renormalization process in QED involves absorbing these infinities by redefining the parameters like charge and mass. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C probably isn't the correct answer.

Then there's Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I recall that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, and perturbative methods work well. But even so, QCD calculations can lead to divergences. Wait, but I also remember that QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, which might have some different behaviors. However, I think that QCD still requires regularization when dealing with loop diagrams and renormalization. So B might not be the right choice.

Next, Superstring Theory. Superstring Theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining general relativity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, instead of point particles, you have strings. The thing is, string theories usually require a lot of dimensions, like ten in the case of superstring theory. Now, I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "particle" is different because they're made of strings. But how about regularization? I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansion doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in QFT because the string propagator doesn't lead to the same loop divergences. Wait, but wait a second. String theories still have loop divergences in their perturbative expansions. Oh right, but perhaps when you compute amplitudes, the divergences are softer or can be handled without traditional regularization methods. Alternatively, maybe because the theory is background-dependent or because of the way the interactions happen, they don't require the same kind of cutoff. Or perhaps because string theories have a natural cutoff at the string scale, so you don't need to add an extra regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. But I think that superstring theories don't require the same kind of regularization as in QED or QCD because their perturbative expansions are better behaved. Or maybe they don't need regularization because the theory is finite? Or perhaps it's because they don't have the same divergent loop integrals. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: regularization is a QFT technique. Strings are a different framework. So maybe they don't require regularization in the same sense because they don't have the same divergences. So perhaps option A doesn't require regularization.

Lastly, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell equations, right? In classical theory, you don't have any infinities because it's a classical theory without quantum effects. There are no divergent integrals in the classical treatment because you don't have things like point charges causing infinite self-energy or issues with the fields at the origin. So in classical electrodynamics, you don't need to regularize because there are no infinities to deal with. So option D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. The question is which theory "never requires regularization at high energies." So D is classical ED, which is a classical theory. It doesn't involve quantum effects, so it doesn't have the divergences that require regularization. So yes, classical ED doesn't require regularization. But then, why is the question about high energies? Because in the quantum theories, the issues become more pronounced at high energies. But for classical theories, the behavior is already fine regardless of energy.

So putting it all together:

- A) Superstring Theory: I'm not entirely sure, but I think it doesn't require regularization because it's a different framework. Or perhaps it does in perturbative calculations, but I'm not certain.
- B) QCD: Needs regularization because of loop divergences.
- C) QED: Needs regularization.
- D) Classical ED: Doesn't need regularization because it's classical and doesn't have the same divergences as QFTs.

So the correct answer would be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze each option:

1. **Superstring Theory (A):** Superstring Theory is a framework where particles are replaced by strings. While it is a candidate for a theory of everything, it still involves perturbative expansions with loop diagrams, which can lead to divergences. However, string theories are formulated differently from quantum field theories, and their perturbative divergences are softer or handled without traditional regularization methods. Despite this, regularization is not entirely ruled out in all contexts of superstring theory.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (B):** QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, involves quarks and gluons. It requires regularization due to divergences in loop diagrams, even though it has asymptotic freedom at high energies. Renormalization techniques are necessary to handle these infinities.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (C):** QED, the quantum field theory of electrons and photons, is known to have divergent loop diagrams. Regularization and renormalization are essential to make sense of these infinities and are widely used in QED calculations.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (D):** Classical Electrodynamics, based on Maxwell's equations, is a classical theory without quantum effects. It does not involve divergences or infinities that require regularization, as it deals with smooth fields and classical particles. Therefore, it never requires regularization at any energy scale.

Given this analysis, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
