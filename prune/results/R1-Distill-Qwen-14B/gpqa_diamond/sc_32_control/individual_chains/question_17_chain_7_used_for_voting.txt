Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem states that the solution has a 0.02 M concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of the stability of a complex. A higher Kf means a more stable complex. So in this case, the complex is really stable because Kf is 5e10, which is a pretty big number.

Wait, but what's the setup here? The solution is of the Ca-EDTA complex, so I'm assuming it's the complex that's dissolved, not the individual ions. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. But we're asked about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, each Ca²+ ion binds with one EDTA^4- ion, forming the complex CaY²−. So the complex is CaY^2-.

In solution, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The reaction would be:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 5e10.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second. I think the formation constant is the reverse of the dissociation. Oh right, Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. So the dissociation would have a reciprocal. So the dissociation constant, Kd, would be 1/Kf.

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, the problem gives us K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. So that's our Kf.

So, considering the solution, let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY²−], which is 0.02 M. The dissociation would produce Ca²+ and Y^4−. Let me set up the variables.

Let’s let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, the concentration of Y^4− would also be x, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, we get one mole of each ion.

So, the expression for the dissociation equilibrium is:

Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4−] / [CaY²−] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x)

But since Kd is 2e-11, which is a very small number, x must be much smaller than 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies the equation.

So x² / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11 → x² ≈ 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 * 2e-11 is (2 * 2) * (1e-2 * 1e-11) ) → 4e-13.

Wait, but Kd is 2e-11, right? So x² = Kd * [CaY²−] → x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 → 2e-11 * 2e-2 is (2*2) * (1e-11 * 1e-2) → 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Hmm, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, and the square root of that is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Because 6.5 * 2 is 13. So yes. So x would be 2e-6.5 M.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. That's approximately 6.3e-7 M, which looks like option C: 6.3e-7 M.

But wait, let me double-check the math. Alternatively, using exponents:

x² = (2e-11) * (0.02) → 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-11 * 2e-2 = (2*2) * 1e-13 =4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Yes, that makes sense. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by \( K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} \). Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium, the concentrations of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{Y}^{4-} \) are both \( x \), and the concentration of the complex \( \text{CaY}^{2-} \) is approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.02 \), so \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \).

The equilibrium expression becomes:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
