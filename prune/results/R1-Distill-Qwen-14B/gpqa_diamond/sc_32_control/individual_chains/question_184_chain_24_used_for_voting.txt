Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Benzene with substituents. Let's number the positions. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement? Wait, no, because 1,2,3 are adjacent, meaning they are in a row. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,3 are adjacent in a way that each is next to the other two. So substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions.

Wait, but when numbering, the substituents should get the lowest possible numbers. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. That would make the substituents in a 1,2,3 pattern, which is a meta arrangement for two substituents but adjacent for three.

Wait, actually, benzene is a ring, so when you have substituents at 1, 2, and 3, that's like a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But in terms of directing, each substituent directs incoming groups in a certain way.

Now, the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene, we need to add these substituents in the correct order. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. Each step is a reagent, like tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation), or nitration (HNO3 with H2SO4), or sulfonation (SO3 with H2SO4), or things like diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), etc.

So the key is to add the substituents in an order that takes into account the directing effects of each group. Because once a substituent is added, it directs where the next substituent goes.

Let me think about each substituent:

1. tert-butyl group: Alkylation via Friedel-Crafts. This is a strong activating group. It is an alkyl group, so it's ortho/para directing.

2. Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): An ether, which is an activating group. Also ortho/para directing.

3. Nitro group (NO2): A strong deactivating group, meta directing.

So the order in which these groups are added matters because each new group will affect where the next group goes.

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. Let me draw it mentally: let's say position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

Wait, but substituents can be added in any order. The key is that each step should be a regioselective addition based on the current substituents.

Let me think about possible sequences.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, ethoxy is a strong activating group, so after adding ethoxy, the next substituent would go into ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy. But if I add tert-butyl next, which is also activating, it would go ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, adding nitro, which is deactivating and meta directing, but which substituent would it affect? Or does it matter?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last because it's deactivating and would interfere with further reactions if added early. Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation (for tert-butyl) and nitration are both reactions that require activating groups to proceed. So if you add nitro early, you might deactivate the ring too much for the other reactions to proceed.

So maybe the nitro should be added last. That makes sense because once nitro is added, the ring is deactivating, but if other groups are already in place, the nitration can occur in the desired position.

So the plan is:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy group via another Friedel-Crafts (but wait, ethoxy is an activating group but is it introduced via electrophilic substitution? Wait, ethoxy is an ether. Oh, wait, ethoxy is usually introduced via an O-alkylation, perhaps using something like ethyl bromide with a base? Or maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's less common.

Wait, I think introducing an ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible because that would require ethyl chloride and AlCl3, but ethyl chloride is less likely to form the carbocation as easily as a bulky group like tert-butyl. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's more for when the ring is activated towards that, usually with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction. Oh wait, perhaps using ethyl bromide and a base. Wait, but benzene is not reactive towards SN2. Oh, but sometimes ethoxy groups can be introduced via the Williamson ether synthesis, but that's for when you have an alkoxide attacking an electrophilic carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Nitro groups are electron-withdrawing, which can activate the ring towards nucleophilic substitution. But wait, nitro groups are meta directors, so if we have a nitro group, adding another substituent would be in the meta position relative to nitro. Hmm, perhaps the sequence is different.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to first add the tert-butyl, then the nitro, and then the ethoxy. Or another order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups because adding it later would not deactivate the ring too early.

Wait, let me think again. The target molecule has the nitro group in the 3 position, which is adjacent to the ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So perhaps the nitro group is added last because it's a meta director, and it would direct further substituents to the meta position relative to itself. But once nitro is present, it's deactivating, so maybe the other groups were added before.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is placed in a position that's ortho or para to another substituent. Let's see.

Wait, maybe the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), activating the ring.

2. Add nitro group (nitration) in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group.

3. Then, add ethoxy group, which would go para to the nitro or ortho to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So substituents are in adjacent positions. Wait, that would require that the second substituent is added in an adjacent position.

Wait, maybe the nitro is added second. Let me think: first, add tert-butyl. Then, add nitro in the meta position relative to tert-butyl. Then, add ethoxy in a position that's ortho to tert-butyl and adjacent to nitro.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to outline the possible sequences for each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps are i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3; iii) SO3; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) H2SO4; vi) H3O+/H2O/heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3.

Wait, this seems to have multiple steps, maybe more than needed. I'm not sure. Let me think about each step.

Wait, perhaps the order goes like this: first, Friedel-Crafts to add t-Bu. Then, nitration. Then, perhaps some other step.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule. The substituents are at 1, 2, 3. Let's say the benzene is numbered so that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So positions 1,2,3 are all adjacent.

So the substituents are in a row. How can that happen? Each substituent should be added in a way that it's directed by the previous substituents.

Let me try the following order:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts). Now the ring has a t-Bu group. It's activating, so the next substituent will go ortho or para.

2. Add nitro group. Since t-Bu is ortho/para director, nitro group can be added in ortho or para to t-Bu. But the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to both t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). So maybe nitro is added after ethoxy.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct sequence is to add the nitro group first, but that would deactivate the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first.

Wait, another approach: The target has substituents at positions 1,2,3. Let's think about the order of adding these substituents.

If I add the nitro group last, then the ring would have the ethoxy and t-Bu groups already. Nitration is a meta director, but if the ring is activated by the ethoxy and t-Bu, the nitronium ion would add in the available position.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: add t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl: benzene â†’ t-Bu benzene.

Step 2: Introduce ethoxy group. How? Maybe via another Friedel-Crafts, but ethoxy would require an ether, which is an activating group. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, adding ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution would require the ring to be activated by a strong electron-withdrawing group, which we don't have yet. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after some activation.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a -O- group attack. Another way is to have the ethoxy introduced via a O-alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a SN2 mechanism, but that's not common. Wait, perhaps it's added via a substitution where the ring is activated. Let me think: perhaps after t-Bu is added, the ring is activated, so the next substituent (ethoxy) can be added via another Friedel-Crafts. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl halides. So to add an ethoxy group, perhaps we need a different approach.

Wait, maybe it's added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must have strong electron-withdrawing groups. But currently, it has t-Bu (activating), so that's not right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution using a directing group. For example, maybe after nitration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been sulfonated, as sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivating and meta directors, making the ring susceptible to nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but then we would need to have a sulfonic acid group already present, which we don't in the target. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction using a nitration step first. Let me think: if the first substituent is nitro, but then that would deactivate the ring for further electrophilic substitution reactions. But then, how to add t-Bu and ethoxy?

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu (Friedel-Crafts alkylation).

2. Add nitro group in ortho or para to t-Bu.

3. Then add ethoxy group in a position directed by the other substituents.

Wait, let's say after adding t-Bu, the next step is nitration. Nitration would add nitro in ortho or para to t-Bu. Suppose the nitro is added para to t-Bu. Then, the ring has t-Bu (position 2) and nitro (position 6, assuming benzene is numbered with t-Bu at position 2 and nitro at 6). Then, adding ethoxy would be directed by both substituents. But the target requires ethoxy at position 1, which is adjacent to both t-Bu and nitro.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to look at each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option D: the steps are i) HNO3, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3, iv) HNO3 again, etc. So option D starts with nitration. If the first step is nitration, which adds a nitro group. Nitro is meta director, so the next substituent would go meta to nitro. But the ring already has nitro; but wait, the target has both t-Bu and ethoxy which are activating. So after nitration, the ring would be deactivating, making further electrophilic substitution difficult. So option D might not be the right path because after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, making further Friedel-Crafts steps difficult.

Option A: first t-Bu alkylation, then nitration, then sulfonation, then diazotization, etc. Hmm, the steps are i to ix, which is a lot. Maybe the sulfonation is a problem because sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivating.

Option B: t-BuCl first, then nitration, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then nitration again, then diazotization, etc. Not sure.

Option C: t-BuCl, then sulfonation, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, etc.

Wait, perhaps sulfonation is used as a protecting group. Sulfonating the ring could activate certain positions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has been activated with strong deactivating groups. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the substituents' directing effects again.

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. So, if I imagine the ring, substituents are at adjacent positions. Let's say the first substituent is t-Bu at position 2. Then, the next substituent could be ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to t-Bu). Then, adding nitro at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu and adjacent to ethoxy).

But how does that happen? Let's outline:

1. Add t-Bu at position 2 via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to t-Bu). For this, how? Since t-Bu is activating, the ethoxy (another activating group) can be added via another electrophilic substitution. So perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride and AlCl3. Wait, but ethoxy is an -O- group; Friedel-Crafts alkylation would add an alkyl group, not an ether.

Ah, right. So introducing an ether group (like ethoxy) isn't done via Friedel-Crafts. So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, to do that, the ring would need to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. How?

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction using a nitro group as a leaving group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about each option's steps.

Let's look at option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration.

So after adding t-Bu, we nitrate. The nitration would occur in the ortho or para position relative to t-Bu.

So t-Bu is at position 2; nitration would add NO2 at position 1 (ortho) or position 5 (meta?) Wait, no. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so adding a group at position 2 (t-Bu), the possible positions for nitration would be 1,3,4,5,6. But t-Bu is activating, so nitration would occur where? Ortho, meta, or para?

Wait, no, t-Bu is an activating, ortho/para director. So nitration would occur ortho or para to t-Bu. So if t-Bu is at position 2, nitration would be at position 1 (ortho) or position 6 (para), or perhaps position 3 (meta? No, because t-Bu is ortho/para director).

Wait, if t-Bu is at position 2, the ortho positions are 1 and 3, and the para is position 6. So nitration could be at 1 or 3.

Suppose in option B, after adding t-Bu, we nitrate to position 1. Then, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and nitro at 1. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl. Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. But what is being reduced here? Nitro groups can be reduced to amines. So maybe the nitro group is converted to an amine. Then, step iv is nitration again? That doesn't make sense because after reducing nitro to amine (which is a strong activating group), nitration would occur, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is a different reaction. Wait, maybe it's a substitution. I'm not sure. Let me check the steps again.

Option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation â†’ t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration â†’ nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ likely reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 â†’ nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat â†’ hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution (like SN2).

viii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

This seems complicated. Let me see if the sequence makes sense. After adding t-Bu and nitro, then reducing nitro to amine, then nitrating again. Not sure.

Option C: steps are i) t-BuCl, ii) SO3, iii) HNO3, iv) Fe/HCl, etc.

Wait, adding SO3 (sulfonation) after t-Bu. So after the t-Bu is added, sulfonating would add a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta director. Then, nitration would be directed by the sulfonic acid and t-Bu groups.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the desired product.

Option D: starts with HNO3, which adds nitro group. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then t-BuCl, etc. But adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult.

So, option D seems unlikely because after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making the next steps (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) not feasible.

So, focusing on option B and option C.

Option B: After adding t-Bu and nitro, then Fe/HCl, which reduces nitro to amine. Then, HNO3 again? That would add another nitro group? Not sure.

Wait, the target only has one nitro group, so perhaps that's not right.

Option C: i) t-BuCl, ii) SO3 â†’ sulfonate. So now, the ring has t-Bu and a sulfonic acid group. Then iii) HNO3 â†’ nitration. The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, and t-Bu is activating. So nitration would occur where? Probably where the combined directing effects point.

Hmm, but this is getting a bit too vague.

Maybe I should think about the possible order in which substituents should be added. Since the target has a nitro group, which is deactivating, it's best to add it last because once it's present, it makes further electrophilic substitution difficult.

So the correct order would be:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy group via another substitution.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy. Oh, perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after creating a good leaving group. For example, if we have a nitro group as a meta director, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has been sulfonated. Let's say, after adding the t-Bu group, we sulfonate to create a leaving group (sulfonic acid). Then, perform a substitution with ethyl bromide. But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is present. But again, I'm not seeing the steps clearly.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack. Nitro groups are deactivating, which is the opposite. So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Grignard reagent or similar, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution using a leaving group. For example, if a chloride is present, then using NaOH and EtBr could perform an alkylation. Wait, that's the SN2 mechanism. So perhaps after a leaving group is introduced, like a chloride, the ethoxy group can be added.

So, let's think:

1. Add t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts â†’ benzene â†’ t-Bu benzene.

2. Introduce a good leaving group, like Cl, in a position ortho to t-Bu. How? Maybe via nitration, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps after t-Bu is added, we nitrate in the ortho position to t-Bu. Then, the Cl could be introduced via a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after a nitration step.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Nitrate in the meta position relative to t-Bu (so, position 3).

3. Then, add ethoxy in the ortho position relative to t-Bu (position 1).

Wait, but how to add ethoxy at position 1.

Wait, after t-Bu (position 2) and nitro (position 3), the next substituent would be directed by both groups. So, the remaining position to add ethoxy is position 1, which is ortho to t-Bu and para to nitro. But I'm not sure about the directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction after the nitro group is in place.

Another approach: the target has ethoxy at position 1, which is adjacent to t-Bu at 2 and nitro at 3. So, the ethoxy is between t-Bu and nitro.

If I add ethoxy first, then t-Bu would be added in the ortho position relative to ethoxy. Then, nitro would be added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which might be adjacent to t-Bu.

But adding ethoxy first is challenging because adding an ether group via Friedel-Crafts isn't straightforward. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution using a nitration step to create a nitro group as a meta director. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct order is:

1. Add nitro group first. But that would deactivate the ring, making other substitutions difficult.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after the other substituents. So, first add t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy. Let me think.

So, step 1: t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts â†’ t-Bu benzene.

Step 2: Add ethoxy. How? Maybe via a substitution. For that, perhaps we need a leaving group. For example, if we introduce a nitro group next to the ethoxy, but that seems circular.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Looking at option B:

The steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 â†’ t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3 â†’ nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ nitro reduced to amine.

iv) HNO3 â†’ nitro added again.

Wait, that seems odd because the target has only one nitro group. So option B can't be correct.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl â†’ Friedel-Crafts.

ii) SO3 â†’ sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 â†’ nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2 â†’ diazotize.

vi) HNO3 â†’ nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O â†’ hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr â†’ substitution.

Hmm, this seems too many steps and I'm not sure.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl.

ii) HNO3.

iii) SO3.

iv) NaNO2.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+.

vii) NaOH.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) HNO3.

That's a lot, but perhaps the sequence makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy. Let me think of the steps:

Add t-Bu â†’ Friedel-Crafts.

Then, add ethoxy. Since t-Bu is activating, maybe via a substitution. Wait, perhaps using ethyl bromide with a strong base, like NaOH, but benzene isn't reactive towards SN2. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has been activated by another group. For example, t-Bu is present, then we nitrate, which adds a nitro group. Then, perhaps the nitro group allows substitution at a certain position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has been sulfonated, making a good leaving group. Let me think.

So, step 1: t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

Step 2: sulfonate â†’ add a sulfonic acid group (SO3), making a good leaving group.

Step 3: substitute the sulfonic acid with ethoxy. How? Maybe using NaOH and ethyl bromide.

Wait, that's a SN2 reaction, but the ring's substitution is not straightforward. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution using a nitro group as a meta director. But again, it's unclear.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a decision based on the options.

Looking at the options, the correct order should be to add t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Because nitro is deactivating and should be added last.

But how to add ethoxy. Since Friedel-Crafts isn't applicable for ethers, perhaps ethoxy is added via a substitution.

Looking at the options, option C has steps: t-BuCl, then SO3, then HNO3, etc. So after t-Bu and SO3, maybe the next steps involve nitration. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence starts with t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the product has an ethoxy group which is an activating group. So it must have been added via an electrophilic substitution. But since it's an ether, perhaps it's added via a different method. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after another substituent has been added.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced using NaOH and ethyl bromide in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be activated, which could be achieved by having a strong deactivating group, like nitro.

Wait, but if the nitro is present, it's deactivating, so the ring isn't activated. So this approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has been activated by another group, like t-Bu. But I'm not sure.

After considering all options, I think the correct sequence is to add t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy. Wait, but how to add ethoxy if the ring is deactivated by nitro.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The target molecule has substituents at 1,2,3. So, perhaps the first substituent is t-Bu at position 2. The second is nitro at position 3 (meta to t-Bu). Then, the third is ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to t-Bu and adjacent to nitro).

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitration in the meta position relative to t-Bu â†’ nitro added at position 3.

3. Then, add ethoxy in the ortho position relative to t-Bu â†’ position 1.

But how to add ethoxy. It seems challenging.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution. To perform a substitution, the ring needs a good leaving group. So maybe after nitration, we convert the nitro group to a leaving group, like a chloride, and then substitute with ethoxy.

But converting nitro to chloride isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amine, then undergoes some reaction to become a leaving group.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option B:

After adding t-Bu and nitro, Fe/HCl (which is a reducing agent) would reduce the nitro group to an amine. Then, nitration again. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in option C, after adding t-Bu and SO3, we add nitro. Then, Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine), then diazotization, etc.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitration â†’ nitro added in ortho to t-Bu.

3. Then, introduction of ethoxy via substitution.

But I don't know how that would happen.

Wait, I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to make a guess based on the options.

Looking at the options again, the correct sequence should involve adding t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro. But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-Bu, we add the ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution using a nitro group as a leaving group, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after a sulfonic acid group is added.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the ring has been sulfonated, which creates a good leaving group. Then, using NaOH and EtBr (option B's step vii is NaOH/EtBr), perhaps the ethoxy is introduced.

Wait, looking at option B:

After adding t-Bu and nitro, then Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine. Then, nitration again. Then, NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), then H3O+/H2O (hydrolysis), then NaOH/EtBr (alkylation), etc.

This seems complicated but perhaps the steps are:

- Add t-Bu.

- Nitrate â†’ nitro in ortho or para.

- Reduce nitro to amine.

- Then, maybe nitrify again, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct.

But I'm not confident. I'm going to make an educated guess that option B is the correct sequence.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of each substituent and the feasibility of the reactions. The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are adjacent to each other. The analysis of the options is as follows:

1. **Option A**: The sequence includes Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride, nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, and other steps. However, the sequence appears overly complex and does not clearly align with the required directing effects to achieve the desired substitution pattern. Sulfonation, for example, introduces a strong deactivating group that could interfere with subsequent reactions.

2. **Option B**: The sequence begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration. This is promising because tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, and nitration would add the nitro group in the ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl. Subsequent steps, such as reduction of the nitro group to an amine, nitration again, diazotization, and alkylation with NaOH/EtBr, could potentially lead to the desired product. However, the sequence includes multiple steps that are not immediately clear in achieving the target molecule.

3. **Option C**: The sequence starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation, followed by sulfonation and nitration. Sulfonation introduces a strong deactivating group, which could disrupt the subsequent nitration step. Additionally, the sequence does not clearly explain how the ethoxy group is introduced, which is a critical step in the synthesis.

4. **Option D**: The sequence begins with nitration, which adds a nitro group. However, nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, making further electrophilic substitution reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation, difficult. This makes the sequence unlikely to produce the desired product.

Given the analysis, **Option B** appears to be the most plausible sequence. It starts with the addition of the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, followed by nitration. The subsequent steps, though complex, could potentially lead to the desired substitution pattern by directing the ethoxy and nitro groups into the correct positions. While the sequence is not entirely clear, it aligns better with the required directing effects and reaction feasibility compared to the other options.

Answer: B
