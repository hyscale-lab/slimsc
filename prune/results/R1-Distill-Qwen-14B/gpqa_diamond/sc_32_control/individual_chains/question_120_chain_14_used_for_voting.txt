Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down. So, the setup is that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means the same number of stars in every region of space, but I'm not entirely sure. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being a different power law.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. That means as parallax increases, the distance decreases and vice versa.

The question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So I need to find how N (number of stars) depends on plx. Let me think about how the distribution works. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's denote the number density as n (stars per cubic parsec, perhaps).

So, to find the number of stars in a certain volume, I'd multiply n by that volume. But wait, the question isn't about a volume; it's about a range of parallax. So perhaps I should think in terms of a shell between parallax plx and plx + dplx, and find the number of stars in that shell.

Wait, so a shell would be a thin layer at a certain distance. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance in parsecs here). Since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But wait, dr is the change in distance, but plx is changing, so maybe I should express dr in terms of dplx.

Let me see, since plx = 1/r, taking differential both sides: dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So rearranging, dr = - r² dplx. But since r is positive, and plx is positive, I can drop the negative sign (as we're considering small increments, so dplx is positive when r decreases). So dr = (1/plx)^2 dplx.

Wait, substituting that into the volume expression. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx and dr = (1/plx²) dplx, so:

Volume = 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx ) 

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. So, substituting r = 1/plx:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr.

But dr is (1/plx^2) dplx, because dr = (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, this might be the confusion point. Let me think again. Since plx = 1/r, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dr is proportional to dplx, but here, when plx increases, r decreases. But for the volume, I think it's okay because we're considering a small change in plx, so dplx is positive when plx increases, which would correspond to a decrease in r (since plx is 1/r). So the actual dr is negative, but when computing the volume, the shell's volume is positive, so perhaps we should take the absolute value. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating the signs. Let me approach it another way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the number of stars in terms of plx. Let's think about the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. So, the number N is equal to the number density (n) multiplied by the volume between those two plx values.

But wait, how do I find the volume corresponding to a range in plx?

Alternatively, since plx = 1/r, the distance r corresponds to a sphere of radius r. So, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr is n * 4π r² dr. But dr is the change in r, which I need to express in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/r, dplx = - (1/r²) dr, so dr = - r² dplx. So, substituting back, the volume element becomes 4π r² (-r² dplx) )= -4π r^4 dplx. But since dplx is positive when r decreases, and I'm considering a thin shell, perhaps I should take the absolute value, so the volume element is 4π r^4 |dplx|.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused with the signs. Let's try to express everything in terms of plx. So, plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So, the volume element dV is 4π r^2 dr. But dr is the change in r, which I need to express in terms of dplx.

From plx = 1/r, differentiating both sides: dplx = - (1/r²) dr → dr = - r² dplx.

So, substitute r = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, dV = 4π r^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 dplx) )

But that gives dV = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, the negative sign suggests that as plx increases, r decreases, so the volume (as a function of plx) is decreasing. But when looking at the number of stars, we're interested in the absolute value. So, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that makes the volume proportional to 1/plx^4 times the change in plx. So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * dV, where n is the number density. So, N = n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, N is the number of stars per unit plx. So, if I want the number per unit plx, I can think of it as N per dplx, which is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number density as a function of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the number of stars per unit plx would decrease as plx increases, because higher plx means closer stars, but in this model, the density is uniform in space, so the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the number of stars is the same in all regions (uniform density), then the number in a shell depends on the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell at a given distance r is 4π r² dr. But as plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π / plx^4 * dplx. So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the number of stars per unit plx (dV as a function of plx) would decrease as 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for a given plx, how many stars are there per each increase in plx. So, it's the number per dplx. So, if N is proportional to dV, which is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx, then the number per unit plx is (n * 4π) / plx^4. So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I seem to recall that the number of stars per unit distance is related to the inverse square law. Oh wait, but in this case, the question is about per unit of plx, which is 1/d. So, perhaps I'm mixing up the dependencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so the number in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell. Since the volume for a given plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, then the number of stars in a shell is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the number per unit plx (the derivative, maybe) would be that.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of stars per unit distance. If the number density is n, then in a volume dV, the number is n dV. If I consider a thin shell between r and r+dr, then the number is n * 4π r² dr. So, as a function of r, the number per dr is 4π n r². Since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx, so substituting, the number per dr is 4π n (1/plx)^2. But dr is (1/plx^2) dplx, as earlier. Wait, perhaps this approach is getting me confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the number per unit plx. Let's say I want to know how many stars are there per unit change in plx. So, the number of stars in a thin shell (between plx and plx + dplx) is n * dV, where dV is the volume of that shell. As earlier, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr, and dr = (1/plx^2) dplx. So, substituting, dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the answer should be option A.

Hmm, but another approach: the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which is dN/dplx. So, the number of stars in a range dplx is dN = n * dV, where dV is the volume corresponding to that plx range. As established, dV = 4π (1/plx)^4 dplx. So, dN/dplx = n * 4π / plx^4. So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by \( dN = n \cdot dV \), where \( dV \) is the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is \( dV = 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we get \( dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dr \). 

To express \( dr \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \), we differentiate \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), yielding \( d\text{plx} = -\frac{1}{r^2} dr \), or \( dr = -r^2 d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into \( dV \), we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars in the shell is:

\[
dN = n \cdot dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This shows that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases, following the power law \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
