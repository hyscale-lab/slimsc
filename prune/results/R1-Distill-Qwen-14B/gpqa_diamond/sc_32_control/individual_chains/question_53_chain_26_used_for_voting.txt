Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Wait, wait, di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene has two groups attached to it.

The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm-1, I think. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

First, two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests that the aromatic protons are split into two sets. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions that lead to two different types of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, but wait that would give a certain symmetry. Wait, no, wait: if the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent H's. For example, if it's 1,2-disubstituted (ortho), then maybe the aromatic protons are in two different environments. Or maybe one substituent is in the meta position relative to the other. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ortho and something else. Hmm, not entirely sure yet.

Then, the NMR shows two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets, corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an ester group. Wait, ester groups are typically O-C-O, but they don't have vinyl protons unless there's a double bond adjacent. Oh, wait, maybe the ester is part of a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the ester group is O-C-O, but if it's part of a group like an acrylate (like CH2=CHCOO-), then that would have vinyl protons. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is an ester with a vinyl group.

So, let's imagine the substituent on benzene is something like an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Like maybe something like CH2CH2COO-R, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a substituent where the ester is part of a larger group with a double bond nearby. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

Then, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests some coupling between these protons. For a vinyl group, like in an ester, the protons on the double bond are typically split based on their neighboring protons.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an aromatic ring with an ester group, but that's the same as the main ring. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a side chain that includes an ester and a vinyl group.

So, maybe the substituent is something like CH2CH2COO-R? No, wait. Let's think about the structure. Let's say the benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, maybe like O-CO-O-R, but that's not right. No, esters are RCOOR', so maybe the substituent is an ester, like -OOCR, but wait, that's an ether. Hmm, no, wait, an ester substituent would be O-CO-O-R attached to the benzene, which would be like a phenyl ester. But that might not have vinyl protons.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a side chain. Let's say the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -O-CO-OCH2CH2-... No, that doesn't quite make sense. Maybe the substituent is an acyl group attached via an ester, and that acyl group is connected to a vinyl group. For example, the substituent could be CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

So, benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is CH2=CHCOO- (as an ester) and the other substituent could be something else. Or maybe both substituents are of the same type, but I don't think so because the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H, which suggests two different types of H on the ring.

Wait, but the compound is di-substituted, meaning two substituents on the benzene ring. So each substituent might be an ester group or one substituent is an ester and another is something else.

But wait, the FTIR only shows an ester group. So perhaps both substituents are ester groups, but that seems unlikely since an ester group would have an O and a carbonyl, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is another group, but the other group doesn't show up in the IR because it's not a functional group, but the ester is the main feature.

Wait, but the NMR has six signals. So the benzene ring has two different types of aromatic protons, which would happen if the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two distinct environments. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be equivalent and only one signal, but since there are two signals, maybe the substituents are in positions that break symmetry, like in the ortho or meta positions.

Wait, let me think about di-substituted benzene. If the substituents are in the para position, then the ring would have two equivalent protons on each side, making the aromatic protons split into two triplet-like signals (wait, no, for para substituents, the aromatic protons are in two pairs, each being equivalent. So, for example, in para substitution, the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs, each as a pair. So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic H. Oh wait, the question says two signals for aromatic H, so perhaps that's correct.

But then, what about the substituents? Let's think about the substituents. One substituent is an ester group (so -O-CO-O-R, but that would be an ether, not an ester. Wait, no, an ester is RCOOR', so the substituent would be something like RCOO- attached to the benzene. So if the substituent is RCOO-, then the benzene has two such substituents? Or perhaps one substituent is RCOO- and the other is something else, like a methyl group or another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for the -CH3 groups, so that would be two different methyl groups. So perhaps each substituent ends with a methyl group. Or maybe one substituent has a methyl group and the other substituent doesn't, but that would result in only one -CH3 signal. But the NMR shows two signals for -CH3, so that suggests two different methyl groups.

So perhaps the two substituents are each esters, each with a methyl group. Or each substituent is an ester group, with a methyl group as the R' in RCOOR'.

Wait, but then the structure would be benzene with two ester groups. But that seems a bit unusual, but possible. So each ester group would be, say, O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, that would be a methoxy group ester. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are OAc groups (acetyloxy), which are ester groups.

Wait, but if each substituent is an OAc group, then the benzene would have two OAc groups attached. Then, the NMR would have aromatic protons split into two signals because of the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group with a methyl group (like OCH2CH3) but that's an ether, not an ester. Hmm, getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like -O-CO-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester.

Wait, let's think about the substituent structure. Let's imagine the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -(CH2=CHCOO-) attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl group would have protons that are split in the NMR.

So, for the vinyl H, in the substituent, we have a CH2=CHCOO- group. The vinyl protons (on the CH2=CH-) would each have neighboring Hs. The protons on the double bond are each attached to a CH2 and CH group. So for the double bond, the structure would be CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, no, the structure would be like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH of the CH2=CH- group.

Wait, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-... No, wait, that's an ester with a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CO-O-R, but that's a side chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So the benzene ring has two substituents, each being CH2=CHCOO-? Or perhaps each substituent is a CH2=CHCOO- group, but that would imply four substituents, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl ester, and the other substituent has a methyl group. So, the substituents are -CH2CH2COO- and -CH3. Wait, but that's not a substituent structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the ester is attached to a vinyl group, such as CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is CH2=CHCOOR, but where R is attached to the benzene ring. Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2=CHCOOR. No, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester with a vinyl group. Hmm.

But perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

So, for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2 → (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2 = 5 DoU.

Option B: C12H14O2 → (26-14)/2 =12/2=6 DoU.

Option C: C12H12O2 → (26 +2 -12)/2 → 16/2=8? Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Since X and N are zero here.

Option C: C=12, H=12. So 2*12 +2 =26. 26-12=14. 14/2=7 DoU.

Wait, let me compute each:

Option A: C11H14O2 → (2*11 +2 -14 ) / 2 → (22+2-14)=10 →10/2=5.

Option B: C12H14O2 → (2*12+2 -14) =26-14=12 →12/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2 → (2*12+2 -12) →26-12=14 →14/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2 → (2*11 +2 -12) →24-12=12 →12/2=6.

So, each option's DoU is:

A:5, B:6, C:7, D:6.

Now, the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring (benzene) which has 3 DoU (benzene ring is three double bonds). Then, what about the substituents?

If the substituent(s) include an ester group (which has a double bond in the carbonyl), that's another DoU. Then, the vinyl groups (double bonds) in the substituents would add more.

So, the benzene ring contributes 3 DoU. The ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU). The vinyl group (if present) adds another DoU.

So, let's see:

The substituent could be an ester group with a vinyl group attached. So, for example, the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to benzene.

So, the substituent is CH2=CHCOOR, but R here is attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be something like O-CO-OCH2CH2- attached to benzene? No, maybe not.

Alternatively, the substituent is a group where the ester is part of a vinyl group. For example:

Benzene-O-CO-OCH2CH2-... No, wait, that's not right. Let's think of the substituent as a side chain.

Let me consider a specific example. Let's say the substituent is a group like -O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. But that's an ester and an ether, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, let's get back to the NMR. The NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl H is coupling with other Hs. For a trans double bond, the coupling would be with adjacent Hs.

Wait, for a structure like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2 and CH groups. So, the CH2 group would be next to the double bond, and the CH would be the other end.

In such a case, the CH2 group's protons would be split by the adjacent CH's protons. So each CH2 proton would be a doublet because they're coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH.

Wait, but in a CH2=CH- group, each CH2 proton is adjacent to the CH which has two protons. So, each CH2 proton would split into a quartet (n+1, where n=3 for coupling with three adjacent Hs?), but wait, no, in a trans configuration, each CH2 proton is adjacent to two protons on the other side of the double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 group is next to a CH3 group. Wait, but the NMR shows two -CH3 signals, which suggests two different methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an ester group with a methyl group. So, each substituent is O-CO-OCH3. But that would be two methoxy ester groups attached to the benzene. But then, the NMR would have signals for the OCH3 groups as singlets, but the question mentions two -CH3 signals. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are esters with a methyl group as the R group. For example, each substituent is PhCOOCH3, but that would add two methyl groups, each as OCH3. But OCH3 groups are usually singlets in NMR, and the question says two -CH3 signals. So that's probably not it.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group, but not attached to the oxygen. For example, substituents like CH2CH3 groups, but that would be ethyl, which has CH2 and CH3. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, only CH3. So maybe the substituents are attached to a group that ends with a CH3.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a tert-butyl group? No, because that would have more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are each a methyl group attached via a double bond. Like, substituents are CH2=CHCOOCH3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a propenyl group. Like, substituent is CH2=CHCH2COO- attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl H would be on the CH2 and CH groups.

But let's think about the NMR signals. The vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. So for the CH2, perhaps each H is split into a doublet due to coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH group. For the CH group, each H would be split into a quartet (n=3, from coupling with three Hs on the adjacent CH2 group). That would explain why one signal is a doublet and another is a quartet.

So the structure would have a CH2=CH- group attached to the ester. So the substituent on the benzene is CH2=CHCOO-.

Wait, but where is the methyl group? Because the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps the ester is RCOOCH3. So, substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to benzene.

So, for each substituent, structure is Ph-O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a -O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 group. But that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene. So, the substituent has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ester (COOCH3). So the substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3.

So, the benzene ring has two such substituents. Wait, but if the substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3, the structure would be Ph-CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, no, that's a side chain, not a substituent on the ring. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester with a vinyl group. Like, substituent is CH2=CHCOO- attached directly to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene-O-CO-OCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU. The ester group contributes 2 DoU (the carbonyl and the ester oxygen doesn't add a DoU, because it's a single bond). Wait, no, the ester group has a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's one DoU. The vinyl group (if present) would add another DoU. So the total would be 3 +1 +1 =5 DoU.

Looking at the options, Option A is C11H14O2 → DoU=5.

Option D is C11H12O2 → DoU=6.

So, if the substituent includes a vinyl group and an ester, total DoU would be 5 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5? Or wait, benzene has 3 DoU, the ester has 1 (carbonyl), the vinyl has 1 (double bond). So 3+1+1=5 DoU. So the molecular formula must have a DoU of 5.

Looking at the options, Option A (C11H14O2) has 5 DoU. So that's a possibility.

But let's see, what would be the formula for the compound?

The benzene ring is C6H6. Each substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group and a methyl group. Wait, but that might complicate the calculation.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a group that adds certain carbons and hydrogens.

Suppose each substituent is a vinyl ester group, like O-CO-OCH2CH2- something. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. So each substituent is CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is attached to the benzene. But wait, it's a di-substituted benzene, so perhaps each substituent has the structure CH2=CHCOO-R, but R could be a methyl group.

Wait, if the substituents are CH2=CHCOOCH3, then each substituent contributes 4 carbons (CH2=CHCOOCH3 is 5 carbons, but wait, CH2=CHCOO- is 3 carbons, plus the methyl as R would add another, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which would be 5 carbons. But then, since there are two substituents on the benzene, that would add 10 carbons, but the benzene has 6, so the total would be 16? No, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with an ester and a vinyl group, but smaller. For example, each substituent is CH2=CHOAc (Ac is acetyl). So each substituent would be CH2=CHOAc, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3.

Wait, the substituent would be Ph-O-CO-OCH2CH2-... No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyl ester with a vinyl group. Let's think of the substituent as CH2=CHCOOCH2Ph. No, that's a side chain, not a substituent.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by considering the substituents and their contributions to the molecular formula.

The NMR shows two -CH3 groups, so the molecule has two methyl groups. So, the formula must have two methyl groups. So, perhaps each substituent contributes a methyl group.

So, if each substituent is an ester group with a methyl group, like O-CO-OCH3, but that would be two methoxy groups, which are OCH3. In that case, the NMR would show singlets for the OCH3 groups.

But the NMR shows two -CH3 signals, which are not singlets. So perhaps the methyl groups are not attached to oxygen. So, maybe each substituent ends with a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are ethyl groups with an ester. But that might not fit.

Another approach: the molecular formula must include the benzene ring (6 carbons), plus the substituents.

Let me count the number of carbons in each option.

Option A: C11H14O2. Benzene is 6 C, so substituents add 5 C.

But it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent contributes (5/2) C, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a -O-CO-O-R group, where R is a methyl group. So each substituent would contribute 3 O's and 2 C's (the O-CO-O is part of the substituent, and R is methyl). Wait, but the benzene is C6, so substituents would add 2*(number of carbons per substituent).

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a -COOCH3 group. So, each substituent is a carboxylic acid ester, like O-CO-OCH3.

But then, each substituent would contribute 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH3), but that's not right because O-CO-O is part of the ester. Wait, no, the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3, which is four carbons (including the O's). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, let's think of the substituent as being a -O-CO-CH2CH3 group. So, each substituent is a ethyl ester group attached to the benzene as an O- group.

In that case, each substituent has 3 carbons: the O-CO-CH2CH3. So two substituents would add 6 carbons. The benzene is 6, so total C would be 6 + (2*3) =12? But looking at the options, C12H14O2 is option B, which has DoU 6. But earlier we thought the DoU needed to be 5.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents have more carbons. Let me think again. Each substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester group). So substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which has 3 carbons in the substituent (the COO and the ethyl). So, two substituents would add 6 carbons (2 substituents *3 carbons each). The benzene is 6 carbons, so total 12.

But the options have C11 and C12. So, if each substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-OCH2CH3, but that's for a mono-substituted benzene. For di-substituted, two such substituents would be C6(COOCH2CH3)2 → which is C6 + 2*(3) (for each COOCH2CH3) → C6 +6 = C12. Then, hydrogen calculation:

Each substituent as O-CO-OCH2CH3: each has O-CO-OCH2CH3, which has for each substituent:

COOCH2CH3 has 2 O, 3 C (COO is O-C-O, and CH2CH3 is 2 C). So each substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is 3 C in the substituent (COOCH2CH3 has 3 C as COO is part of the substituent? Or is it part of the benzene? Wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is an ester group.

Wait, the benzene has two substituents, each being O-CO-OCH2CH3. So each substituent contributes 3 carbons (the COOCH2CH3 is 3 carbons: the carbonyl C, the O, and the ethyl group's two carbons?), no, wait, the COO is connected to the benzene through oxygen. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is three carbons: the carbonyl C, the oxygen, and the ethyl group (two carbons). So each substituent adds 3 carbons, so two substituents add 6, plus benzene's 6, gives C12.

So molecular formula would be C12H12O4? Because each substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which has 4 oxygen (each substituent has two O from COO and one O from OCH2CH3? No, wait, each substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is one O (the O attached to the benzene), then COO, which has two O, and then OCH2CH3 which has one O. So each substituent brings 4 O? So two substituents would bring 8 O, plus the benzene's O? No, the benzene doesn't have O. So total O would be 8. But the options have O2. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think differently.

Since the NMR shows two CH3 signals, the molecule has two different methyl groups. Also, no CH2 signals, which suggests that any CH2 groups are either not present or their signals are not observed (maybe they're split into multiple signals and not recognized as CH2).

The presence of a vinyl group in the substituent would contribute to the DoU.

So, the structure probably has a benzene ring, two substituents that include ester groups and vinyl groups, and two methyl groups.

Let me think of the substituent as a group with a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent could be CH2=CHCOOCH3. So each substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to the benzene ring.

So, each substituent has 5 carbons (CH2=CH-COO-CH3). So two substituents would add 10 carbons. Benzene is 6, so total carbons would be 16, which is not matching any of the options.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are each a methyl group attached to the ester. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is a methyl group. So substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is 5 carbons. So two substituents would add 10 carbons. Benzene is 6, so total C would be 16, which isn't in any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are smaller. Let's say each substituent is CH2=CHOAc, where Ac is OAc (acetyloxy). So substituent is CH2=CHOAc, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So each substituent is 4 carbons. So two substituents add 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so total C would be 14. Looking at the options, C12H14O2 is option B. DoU for option B is 6.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that the DoU needed to be 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester with a vinyl group. Wait, but that's a side chain, not a substituent on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COOCH3, but that has a single bond, no vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a double bond elsewhere. Let me try to sum up the possible formula.

Assuming the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3, each substituent contributes 5 carbons. Two substituents would add 10. Benzene is 6, so total C=16. But none of the options have that.

Hmm, perhaps each substituent is a methyl ester with a double bond. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of hydrogens.

The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. No CH2.

So, for each substituent, perhaps the structure is such that any CH2 groups are not present, which could mean that the substituent is a group without any CH2, but with CH3 and vinyl H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH3. So each substituent has a vinyl group (CH2=CH) and a methyl ester (COOCH3). So in this case, each substituent would contribute:

- CH2=CH: 2 H (each CH2 and CH have Hs)
- COOCH3: 3 H (the methyl group)

So, each substituent would have 2 CH3 groups (from the COOCH3) and the vinyl Hs. Wait, no, the COOCH3 has one CH3.

Wait, each substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So each substituent has a COOCH3 group (which is one CH3) and the vinyl group (CH2=CH). So the substituent has a CH3 from the methyl ester and the vinyl Hs.

So, two substituents would have two COOCH3 groups, giving two CH3 signals, and the vinyl Hs would be split into two signals.

So, the total structure would be benzene with two substituents, each being CH2=CHCOOCH3.

Wait, but the formula would be C6H4(CH2=CHCOOCH3)2. Let's calculate the formula.

Each CH2=CHCOOCH3 has 5 carbons (CH2=CH is 2 C, COO is 2 C, CH3 is 1 C). Two substituents: 2*5=10 C. Benzene:6 C → total C=16. H calculation: benzene is C6H6. Each substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3 → which has 2 (CH2) + 2 (CH) + 3 (COOCH3) =7 H per substituent? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's count H:

CH2=CH- is 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H, each CH has 1 H, but wait, wait, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2=CH–COOCH3.

The CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 1 H (since it's a double bond, each CH has 1 H), the COOCH3 has 3 H (from the methyl group). So per substituent: 2 (CH2) + 1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =6 H. Two substituents would add 12 H. The benzene ring, when di-substituted, would have 4 H (since benzene normally has 6 H, but two substituents leave 4 H).

So total H: 4 (aromatic) + 12 (substituents) =16 H.

But looking at the options, the highest H count is C12H14O2 (14 H). So 16 H doesn't match any option. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is smaller. Let's say each substituent is CH2=CHOAc, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Each substituent contributes 4 carbons (CH2=CH is 2 C, COOCH3 is 2 C).

Wait, but earlier calculation still doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is just a vinyl group attached to the ester, but with fewer carbons.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an acrylate ester, like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached via an ester, but that doesn't explain the vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both methyl groups, but that would not explain the vinyl Hs.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH3-O-CO-CH2CH2-Ph, but that's a side chain, not a substituent on the ring.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think again about the NMR data.

The NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests that the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So, perhaps the substituents are in para positions, leading to two equivalent sets of aromatic protons.

The vinyl Hs: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, the protons on the CH2 and CH of a CH2=CH- group.

So, the structure is benzene with two substituents, each being an ester with a vinyl group. The substituent would be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is attached to the benzene.

If R is a methyl group, then the substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So each substituent has 5 carbons.

But earlier, that led to a formula of C16H16O4, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents are not ester groups on the benzene, but the ester is part of a side chain attached to the benzene.

So, for example, the benzene is substituted with a group like CH2CH2COOCH3, but that's a single bond, so no vinyl Hs. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOCH2Ph. But that's a side chain, not a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2Ph, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester and a vinyl group attached in a way that doesn't add too many carbons. For example, each substituent is a vinyl ester with a methyl group, but with minimal carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3, attached to the benzene.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl acrylate group, like CH2=CHCOOCH3. So each substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3.

So, benzene has two such substituents. Let's calculate the formula.

Each substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3 → 5 carbons. Two substituents: 10 C. Benzene:6 C. Total C:16. That's more than any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps each substituent is a vinyl ester with a methyl group, but only 3 carbons per substituent. So, substituent is CH2=CHOAc, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Again, same problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not on the benzene but are part of a side chain. For example, benzene with a side chain that has an ester and a vinyl group.

For example, the structure could be benzene with a side chain like CH2=CHCOOCH2-. But that would require the substituent to be attached to the benzene via a CH2 group, which would introduce a CH2 in the structure, but the NMR shows no CH2 signals. So that might not fit.

Another possibility: the substituent is a cyclopropane ring with an ester group. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene as a substituent. So, substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH2-Ph. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is just the ester group and a vinyl group in a way that doesn't add too many carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-OCH2CH2Ph, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should abandon the structural approach and instead use the molecular formula options.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → DoU 5.

B) C12H14O2 → DoU 6.

C) C12H12O2 → DoU 7.

D) C11H12O2 → DoU 6.

We determined earlier that the substituents likely contribute a vinyl group (DoU +1) and an ester (DoU +1), plus the benzene's 3 DoU, totaling 5 DoU. So option A (DoU 5) is a possibility.

But let's see what the substituents would look like for option A.

Option A: C11H14O2.

Benzene is C6H6. So substituents contribute 5 C, 8 H, and 2 O.

Wait, substituents have 5 C, 8 H, 2 O. Since it's di-substituted, two substituents, so each substituent would have 2.5 C, which is not possible. So maybe one substituent has 3 C and the other 2 C. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group.

Wait, each substituent could be an ester group with a methyl group. So, substituent is O-CO-OCH3. Each substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 C (COOCH3 has 3 C: the carbonyl C, the O, and the CH3). So two substituents would add 6 C. Benzene is 6, so total would be 12 C. That would be option B (C12H14O2), which has DoU 6.

But earlier I thought the DoU should be 5. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-Me and another group.

Wait, maybe one substituent is O-CO-Me and the other is a methyl group. But that would give a CH3 signal, but also OCH3 signals.

But the NMR shows two CH3 signals, which suggests two different methyl groups. OCH3 would be a singlet, so if the substituent is O-CO-Me, that would contribute a singlet for OCH3.

But the NMR shows two CH3 signals, which are not singlets. So perhaps the methyl groups are not attached to oxygen.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the number of protons in the NMR.

The NMR has six signals:

- 2 aromatic H signals.

- 2 vinyl H signals.

- 2 CH3 signals.

No CH2 signals.

So, the molecule has 2*(number of aromatic H) + 2*(number of vinyl H) + 2*(number of CH3 H) = total H.

Each aromatic H signal could be 2 H each (if the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs). So 2*2=4 H from aromatic.

Each vinyl H signal: one is a doublet (perhaps 2 H?), and the other is a doublet of quartets (maybe 2 H as well). So vinyl H contribute 4 H.

Each CH3 signal: two signals, perhaps each 3 H, so 6 H.

But the total H would be 4 +4 +6 =14 H. Looking at the options, the option with 14 H is option B (C12H14O2) and option A (C11H14O2). Both have 14 H.

But option A has C11H14O2, which is 11 C. Benzene is 6 C, so substituents contribute 5 C. Since it's di-substituted, each substituent would contribute 2.5 C on average, which is impossible. So option A is less likely.

Option B: C12H14O2. Benzene is 6 C, substituents contribute 6 C. So each substituent is 3 C.

If each substituent is 3 C, what could they be?

Each substituent could be a propyl group, but the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals. Alternatively, each substituent is an ester group with a methyl group. So substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 C (COOCH3 has 3 C: C, O, CH3).

So substituents are O-CO-OCH3, each. So two substituents would add 6 C, benzene 6, total 12 C.

The formula would be C12H12O4? Because each substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 4 O each (O from benzene, COO, and OCH3). But the options have O2. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, each substituent is a methyl group attached to an ester. But that's getting messy.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both methyl esters, but that doesn't explain the vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and an ester group. But that's just one substituent, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and another group that includes the ester and vinyl.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl ester group. But that's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a propenoate group. For example, one substituent is CH3 and the other is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. But that would complicate the formula further.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methyl group and an ester group. But not sure.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The ester group is present, so O2 is accounted for. The NMR shows no CH2 groups, which suggests that any CH2 groups in substituents are either not present or perhaps they are part of a vinyl group.

The presence of two CH3 groups and two vinyl Hs suggests that each substituent contributes a CH3 and a vinyl group.

So, each substituent could be a methyl group attached via a double bond to an ester.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is a methyl acrylate group. So substituent is CH2=CHCOOCH3.

Each such substituent has 5 C: CH2=CH (2 C), COO (2 C), and CH3 (1 C) → 5 C.

Two substituents →10 C. Benzene →6 C. Total 16 C. Not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-OCH2CH2Ph. No, that's a side chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester with a vinyl group. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has the structure CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene.

So substituent is CH2=CHCOO-.

But then, what is attached to the benzene? It would be O-CO-O-CH2CH2-Ph, which doesn't make sense.

I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

The molecular formula options:

Option D: C11H12O2 → DoU=6.

Option B: C12H14O2 → DoU=6.

Option A: C11H14O2 → DoU=5.

Option C: C12H12O2 → DoU=7.

If the benzene has two substituents, each with an ester group and a vinyl group, the DoU would be 3 (benzene) + 2 (ester and vinyl) =5. So option A has DoU 5, which fits.

But the formula of option A is C11H14O2. Benzene is 6 C, so substituents contribute 5 C. Two substituents → each substituent has 2.5 C, which is impossible. So option A can't be correct.

Option D: C11H12O2 → DoU=6.

Benzene DoU 3, substituents contribute 3 DoU. So substituents could have an ester (1 DoU) and a double bond (1 DoU), and another double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is an ester group, contributing 1 DoU each, and the benzene contributes 3, so total DoU 5. But option D has DoU 6.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond and an ester. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHOAc, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Each substituent has 5 C. Two substituents would be 10 C. Benzene is 6 → total 16 C, which doesn't match any option.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I'll look for another approach.

The presence of an ester group (O-CO-O) suggests that the formula must have two O's. So all options fit that.

The NMR shows two CH3 groups, so two different methyl groups. The substituents must have two methyl groups that are in different environments.

Perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group with a methyl group.

Wait, but that would require one substituent to be methyl and the other to be an ester with a methyl group. But that would mean the substituents are different, leading to the two CH3 signals.

So, if one substituent is a methyl group (-CH3) and the other is an ester group like O-CO-OCH3, then the two CH3 groups are the methyl substituent and the methyl from the ester.

But the ester substituent would have three O's, which would make the molecular formula have more O's than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and another substituent is an ester group without a methyl, but I don't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and the other is a vinyl ester without a methyl group. But then, where would the second CH3 come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and another substituent is a methyl group (-CH3). Then, the two CH3 groups would be the OCH3 and the -CH3.

In that case, the substituent O-CO-OCH3 contributes a CH3 (as OCH3), and the other substituent contributes a CH3. So, two CH3 signals, one for OCH3 (singlet) and one for the methyl group (maybe as a triplet due to coupling with adjacent groups). But the NMR shows two CH3 signals, which could fit.

So, the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (O-CO-OCH3 → 4 C, O's) + substituent 2 (CH3 → 1 C). Wait, but O-CO-OCH3 is 3 C: COOCH3. So substituent 1 is 3 C, substituent 2 is 1 C. Total C: 6 +3 +1=10 C. But options are C11 and C12, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and another group that includes a vinyl ester with a methyl. So substituent 1 is CH3, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCOOCH3.

CH2=CHCOOCH3 has 5 C. So substituent 1:1 C, substituent 2:5 C. Total C:6+1+5=12 C. So molecular formula would be C12H?O?.

But substituent 2 is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which has 5 C, 7 H (CH2=CH has 3 H, COOCH3 has 3 H from CH3). Substituent 1: CH3 has 3 H.

Benzene: C6H4 (since two substituents) → 4 H.

So total H: 4 (benzene) +3 (CH3) +7 (substituent 2) =14 H.

O: substituent 1 doesn't add O. Substituent 2: O from COOCH3 → 2 O. So O total is 2.

So formula would be C12H14O2. That's option B.

Which has:

DoU=6.

Which would fit if substituent 2 has a vinyl group (1 DoU) and the ester (another DoU). Benzene has 3. So total 3+2=5. But option B has DoU 6. Hmm.

But wait, substituent 2 has a vinyl group (1 DoU) and ester (1 DoU), so substituent 2 contributes 2 DoU. Benzene contributes 3. So total DoU=5.

But option B has DoU 6.

So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is an ester with a vinyl group (2 DoU) and substituent 1 is a methyl group (0 DoU). So total DoU=3 (benzene) +2 (substituent 2) +0 (substituent 1) =5. But option B is DoU 6.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is an ester with a methyl group, contributing 1 DoU. Substituent 2 is a vinyl group, contributing 1 DoU. Benzene:3. Total DoU=5.

But option B has DoU 6.

I'm getting confused. But based on the earlier analysis, if the substituent 2 is CH2=CHCOOCH3, the molecular formula would be C12H14O2 (option B), which has DoU 6.

But according to the structure, substituent 2 contributes 2 DoU (ester and vinyl), benzene 3, total 5. So why does the formula have DoU 6?

Ah! Because the substituent might have another double bond or ring? No, in CH2=CHCOOCH3, the substituent has two double bonds: the vinyl (CH2=CH) and the ester's carbonyl (COO). So that's two DoU. Benzene is 3, so total 3+2=5 DoU. But the formula of option B is C12H14O2, which has DoU 6. So that's a problem.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the DoU for substituent 2.

Each substituent can contribute to the DoU. Let's re-calculate.

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCOOCH3.

Double bonds: 1 (vinyl) + 1 (ester's carbonyl) → 2 DoU.

Substituent 1: CH3 → 0 DoU.

So total DoU: benzene (3) + substituent 2 (2) + substituent 1 (0) =5.

But option B has DoU 6, so that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is benzene with two substituents, each being a methyl ester group and a vinyl group, which adds up to a different DoU.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester with a vinyl group, but that's a side chain.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR shows two CH3 groups, which suggests two different methyl groups. The aromatic Hs are split into two signals, which suggests para substitution. The vinyl Hs suggest a double bond. The ester is present.

The formula likely is C12H14O2 (option B) because it fits the number of Hs (14) and has two substituents that could account for the NMR signals.

But earlier I'm not sure about the DoU.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and another group that includes both a vinyl and an ester, but without adding more DoU.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group with one DoU. For example, a group like CH2=CH2, but that's just a single DoU.

Alternatively, the substituent could be an allyl group with an ester.

I think I've spent enough time on this, so I'll go with option A: C11H14O2.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B fits the H count. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2.

Wait, I'm really not sure. I think I'll have to conclude based on the H count. Since option A and B both have 14 H, which matches the NMR, but their molecular formulas differ.

Given that the substituent structure requires more carbons, perhaps option B is more likely. So I'll choose option B: C12H14O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following insights:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals correspond to aromatic protons, suggesting the benzene ring has two distinct sets of equivalent protons. This is consistent with a di-substitution pattern where the substituents break the symmetry of the ring.

2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals correspond to vinyl protons, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. This indicates the presence of a vinyl group (CH=CH) with coupling between the protons.

3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals correspond to -CH3 groups, suggesting the presence of two different methyl groups in the molecule. No signals for -CH2 groups are observed, implying that any CH2 groups are either absent or not detected in the NMR spectrum.

The molecular formula must account for the benzene ring (C6H6), two substituents, and the functional groups observed in the spectra. The degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as follows:

- **Option A (C11H14O2)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 14}{2} = 5
  \]  
  This matches the expected DoU for a benzene ring (3) plus an ester group (1) and a vinyl group (1).

- **Option B (C12H14O2)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 14}{2} = 6
  \]  
  This suggests an additional degree of unsaturation, which could arise from a structural feature not explicitly accounted for in the analysis.

- **Option C (C12H12O2)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 12}{2} = 7
  \]  
  This is inconsistent with the expected DoU based on the functional groups and substitution pattern.

- **Option D (C11H12O2)**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 12}{2} = 6
  \]  
  This is similar to Option B but does not align with the hydrogen count (12 H) observed in the NMR spectrum.

The NMR data indicates 14 hydrogens in total, which matches the molecular formula of **C12H14O2** (Option B). This formula accounts for the benzene ring, two substituents (each contributing to the observed signals), and the functional groups. While the DoU calculation for Option B suggests an additional degree of unsaturation, this could be explained by structural features not explicitly detailed in the analysis.

ANSWER: B
