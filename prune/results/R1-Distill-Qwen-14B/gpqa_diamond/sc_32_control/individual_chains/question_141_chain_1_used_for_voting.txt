Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. It says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, benzene rings with substituents. So 1-bromo-2-d something. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-diethylaminobenzene? Or perhaps the 'd' stands for another substituent. Wait, maybe it's 2-dimethylamino? Or maybe it's 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene. Oh wait, the numbering is important. So, position 1 is bromo, position 2 is some substituent, probably a strong activating group.

Wait, but the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because diethyl or dimethyl amino groups are common substituents. So, the structure would be bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. So, the positions are adjacent—like ortho positions. Because benzene is a ring, so position 1 and 2 are next to each other.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That's a strong base, right? Typically, NaNH2 in ammonia is used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, but in aromatic chemistry, it's often involved in nucleophilic aromatic substitution or elimination—like for forming rings or dehalogenation.

Wait, but 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene—so two substituents on adjacent carbons. The bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (since it's a meta director), and the dimethylamino group is an electron-donating group (ortho/para director). So when you have two substituents on the benzene ring, their positions and directing effects can influence where the reaction occurs.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? Treating with NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aromatic substitution, sometimes it can lead to elimination if there's a possibility.

Wait, perhaps this is an example of a Benzidine rearrangement? Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts dehydrohalogenation? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But since the ring has strong activating groups, like the dimethylamino group, which is a strong activating group, the ring could be more reactive.

Wait, the dimethylamino group is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group. But the bromine is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So when two substituents are present, the activating groups usually dominate. So in this case, the dimethylamino group is stronger than bromine in activating the ring.

So, when NaNH2 is added, which is a strong base, maybe it abstracts a proton leading to elimination. Because the adjacent positions have an activating group (dimethylamino) and a leaving group (bromine), perhaps a ring contraction or expansion could occur. Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation where the bromine leaves, and the adjacent amino group contributes to a new double bond.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an elimination reaction forming a benzene ring with a new substituent. Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, the bromine is at position 1, dimethylamino at position 2.

If the conditions are strong base, perhaps the Br is eliminated, and a new double bond forms. But that would require adjacent leaving groups or hydrogen positions.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the structure. The benzene ring has Br in position 1 and NMe2 (dimethylamino) in position 2. So the positions are adjacent (1 and 2 are ortho). So when NaNH2 is present, it's a strong base. Maybe it abstracts a proton beta to the Br, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

But wait, benzene rings can't form double bonds like alkenes because they're already conjugated. Oh, but perhaps it's a ring expansion or contraction. Alternatively, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the amino group somehow shifts.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires the ring to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. The dimethylamino group is activating, which makes the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic attack in certain positions.

But NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it acts as a base rather than a nucleophile here. So, maybe it's an elimination reaction, removing H and Br to form a double bond, but in a benzene ring, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps a ring contraction occurs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about possible reactions when a benzene ring has adjacent substituents with a leaving group and an activating group.

I remember that when a benzene ring has a substituent like an amino group and a halogen in the ortho position, treating with a strong base can cause a rearrangement. For example, the formation of aniline via elimination of HX, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a quinoline structure? Quinoline has a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. But how?

Wait, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the amino group is deprotonated, leading to a ring expansion. Let me visualize the structure.

The starting material is benzene with Br at position 1 and NMe2 at position 2. So, the structure is:

       Br
       |
NMe2-C6H4-Br

Wait, no, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So, structure is:

Br is at position 1, NMe2 at position 2. So:

Position 1: Br
Position 2: NMe2
Positions 3,4,5,6: H.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so position 1 is next to 2 and 6. So the substituents are adjacent.

Now, when NaNH2 is added, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination. But wait, the Br is at position 1, so the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. The 2 position has an NMe2 group. So, maybe it abstracts a proton from position 6 (which is adjacent to Br at position 1).

So, position 6 has a hydrogen that's adjacent to Br at 1. The base (NH2^-) would abstract that H, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but benzene is already conjugated, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves, forming a carbocation, but that's unlikely since benzene is aromatic.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzyne formation. Benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in the benzene ring. But that usually requires strong conditions, like heating with a strong base, and elimination of two leaving groups. Wait, but in this case, we have only one Br.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzynelike intermediate. Let me think: if we have Br at C1 and NMe2 at C2, and the base abstracts a proton at C6 (adjacent to Br), then we could form a triple bond between C1 and C6, with Br leaving. But wait, that would require two adjacent leaving groups, but here we have only one.

Hmm, maybe the ring contracts. Wait, if Br leaves, and the ring becomes a five-membered ring? That might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMe2 group undergoes some kind of elimination. Wait, NMe2 is a good leaving group? No, it's a strong activating group, so probably not leaving.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Since the ring is activated by the NMe2 group, perhaps the amino group directs the substitution.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a demetallation reaction, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Benzenering opening. But benzene is aromatic and not easily opened.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from the amino group. Let's see: the NMe2 is a strong base itself, but in the presence of a stronger base like NaNH2, maybe it gets deprotonated. But wait, the amino group is already in a deprotonated state? No, NMe2 is a tertiary amine, which is not usually deprotonated under normal conditions. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it deprotonates the amino group.

Wait, but if the amino group is deprotonated, it becomes a stronger base and a better leaving group? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the base deprotonates a position adjacent to the amino group, leading to elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination leading to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a source of NH2^- ions. So, if the Br is a leaving group, then perhaps NH2^- would attack the ring in a position activated by the dimethylamino group.

Wait, but aromatic nucleophilic substitution usually requires a strongly activated ring (like with strong electron-donating groups) and a good leaving group. In this case, the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, and Br is a good leaving group.

So, perhaps the NH2^- nucleophile attacks the ring in a position activated by the amino group. Since the amino group is at position 2, which is ortho, para-directing. The Br is at position 1, but since it's a leaving group, perhaps the attack would occur at the para position relative to the amino group, which would be position 4.

Wait, but position 1 is already occupied by Br. Wait, so the amino is at position 2, so the para position would be position 5. So, the NH2^- would attack position 5, replacing the Br.

But wait, the Br is at position 1. So, if the dimethylamino group is at 2, the possible attack positions would be ortho (position 1 and 3) and para (position 5) relative to the amino group.

But wait, the Br is at position 1, which is ortho to the amino group. So, if the amino group directs the attack to its ortho and para positions, but position 1 is already occupied by Br, which is a leaving group. So, would the NH2^- attack position 1 (replacing Br), or position 3, or position 5?

Wait, but in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the incoming nucleophile attacks the position that's activated. Since the amino group is at position 2, the para position is 5, and the ortho positions are 1 and 3. But position 1 has Br, which is a leaving group. So, perhaps the attack could be at position 1, leading to substitution of Br by NH2, or at position 3 (but that would be meta to the amino group, which doesn't make sense).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again: the dimethylamino group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, when the ring undergoes substitution, the nucleophile attacks either the ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

In the starting molecule, the amino group is at position 2. So, the ortho positions would be position 1 and 3, and the para position is position 5.

But position 1 is already occupied by Br. So, the only possible position for substitution would be position 3 (ortho) or position 5 (para). Wait, but position 3 is meta to the amino group? No, wait: in benzene, position 2's ortho are 1 and 3, and para is 5. So, position 3 is ortho to 2, yes.

So, the NH2^- could attack either position 1 or position 3 or 5. But position 1 already has Br, which is a leaving group. So, substitution at position 1 would replace Br with NH2. Alternatively, substitution at position 3 or 5 would add a new NH2 group.

Wait, but the ring already has two substituents: Br at 1 and NMe2 at 2. So, adding another NH2 group would give a new substituent.

Wait, but NaNH2 is present, so after substitution, perhaps the Br is replaced by NH2.

Wait, but let's think about the mechanism. In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be strongly activated. The dimethylamino group is such an activator. The leaving group (Br) is in a position ortho to the amino group, which is activated.

So, the NH2^- would attack position 1 (where Br is), displacing Br^- as the leaving group. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene, but wait, that would be a very crowded structure. Alternatively, perhaps position 5 would be attacked, giving a new substituent.

Wait, but in the starting material, the amino (NMe2) is at position 2. If the NH2^- attacks position 5, which is para to position 2, then that's possible. So, in that case, the product would have Br at position 1, NMe2 at 2, and NH2 at 5. But wait, that would be three substituents on the benzene ring, which is possible but perhaps less likely than a substitution at position 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH2^- attacks position 1, replacing Br. So, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But can a benzene ring have two amino groups in adjacent positions? That would be a diamino structure, perhaps leading to some rearrangement.

Wait, but amino groups are strong activating groups. Having two adjacent amino groups might lead to further reactions, but under these conditions, perhaps it's just a substitution.

Wait, but the initial reaction is NaNH2 in ammonia. Maybe the reaction is more about elimination rather than substitution. Let me think again.

Another possibility: the dimethylamino group is a good leaving group? No, that's not right. Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, maybe an elimination occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's not possible in benzene.

Wait, perhaps it's a ring expansion. For example, if the Br and the amino group are on adjacent positions, elimination could form a five-membered ring. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If two adjacent carbons lose a leaving group and form a bond, perhaps the ring becomes five-membered.

Wait, maybe the Br at position 1 and the NMe2 at position 2 could lead to a ring contraction. Let me imagine: if the Br leaves, and the ring contracts, perhaps forming a cyclopentadienyl system. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a quinoline-like structure. Quinoline has a benzene ring fused with a pyridine ring. So, if the amino group is part of a nitrogen-containing ring, that could happen.

Wait, but how? The starting material is a benzene ring with Br and NMe2. If the NMe2 somehow becomes part of a new ring, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a Ullmann-type coupling, but that typically requires copper catalysts and high temperatures, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, where the Br is removed, and a new double bond forms between C1 and C2, but that would require a H on C2, which is adjacent to Br. But C2 has the NMe2 group, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the NH in the NMe2 group, making it a better leaving group. But NMe2 is a strong base, so I don't think it leaves easily.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about similar reactions. I remember that when benzene has an amino group and a halogen in the ortho position, treatment with a strong base can lead to the formation of an aniline derivative via elimination of HX, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the Br and the amino group are ortho, so elimination could form a new ring. Let's imagine: the Br leaves, and the adjacent NMe2 group loses a proton, forming a new bond and creating a ring.

Wait, but that would require both the Br and the amino group to be on adjacent positions, which they are. So, if the Br leaves, and the amino group's hydrogen is abstracted, perhaps a new bond forms between the two carbons (C1 and C2), leading to a five-membered ring. But wait, that might not fit the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMe2 group is part of a larger ring formation. For example, if the Br leaves, and the NMe2 group forms a bridge, creating a new ring.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a pyrrole-like structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: what's the product when a benzene ring with two substituents undergoes substitution with NaNH2? If substitution occurs, how many possible products are there?

In the starting material, the substituents are Br at position 1 and NMe2 at position 2. So, the ring has these two groups in adjacent positions.

If the NH2^- nucleophile attacks the ring, it would target the para position relative to the NMe2 group. So, the para position is position 5. Alternatively, it could attack the ortho positions (positions 1 and 3). But position 1 has Br, so substitution there would replace Br with NH2.

So, possible products:

1. Substitution at position 1: Br is replaced by NH2, giving 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

2. Substitution at position 3: NH2 adds at position 3, giving 3-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

3. Substitution at position 5: NH2 adds at position 5, giving 5-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Wait, but the question is about possible organic products. How many are there?

Wait, but substitution at position 1 would yield a diamine structure. But wait, in reality, is substitution at position 1 feasible? Because position 1 is adjacent to the NMe2 group, which is activating, so it's a possible site for attack.

So, in that case, we could have three possible substitution products: positions 1 (replacing Br), 3, and 5.

But wait, maybe substitution at position 1 is not possible because the amino group is already in position 2, and position 1 is ortho to it. So, if the incoming NH2^- attacks position 1, which is ortho to the existing NMe2 group, perhaps that's sterically hindered. But sterics aren't mentioned, so perhaps it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution occurs at position 3 and 5, leading to two products. Or perhaps substitution at position 1 is allowed, leading to three products.

Wait, but the starting material only has Br at 1 and NMe2 at 2. So, substitution sites would be positions 1 (replacing Br), 3, and 5. So that's three possible products. But wait, the options given are up to 4, with option D being 3.

Wait, but maybe there's another possibility. Could the reaction lead to elimination, forming a new structure instead of substitution?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of HBr, forming a new ring. For example, the loss of Br and a proton from the adjacent carbon (position 2) could form a new double bond, but in a benzene ring, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it leads to the formation of a naphthalene-like structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate the NMe2 group. Wait, but NMe2 is already a tertiary amine; it's not usually deprotonated under these conditions. But in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps it could lose a proton, forming a strong base.

If the NMe2 group loses a proton, it becomes a strong base (NMe2^-), which could abstract a proton from the benzene ring, leading to elimination of Br and forming a new double bond. But I'm not exactly sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a new amino group and the loss of Br. So, substitution occurs, yielding new products.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Reaction: NaNH2 in condensed ammonia.

Possible mechanisms:

1. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution: NH2^- attacks the ring, substituting Br or another position.

2. Elimination leading to formation of a new ring or structure.

If substitution occurs, possible attack positions: 1, 3, 5.

But substituting Br (position 1) would give a product with NH2 and NMe2 in adjacent positions. Substituting position 3 would add NH2 at 3, and substituting 5 would add at 5.

So, three substitution products.

Alternatively, elimination could form a new product, such as a quinoline structure. If that's the case, it would be an additional product.

Wait, but how? Let me think: elimination of H and Br from adjacent positions, then forming a new ring. So, for example, the loss of H from position 2 (NMe2 is at 2, so maybe not) or position 6.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. NMe2 is at position 2, Br at 1. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. The base abstracts a beta proton, say from position 6 (adjacent to Br at 1). Then, Br leaves, and a new bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a five-membered ring. But wait, that would require a ring contraction from six to five members, which is possible via a diradical or similar mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentadienyl ring fused with an amine group. But I'm not familiar with this exact reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent, like a pyridine ring. For example, if the Br and NMe2 groups are eliminated, forming a new ring with a nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a pyridine-like ring. If the NMe2 group loses a proton and the Br leaves, perhaps a new ring with a nitrogen is formed. But I'm not exactly sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2^- abstracts a proton, leading to a ring expansion. I'm not sure.

If elimination occurs, perhaps that's an additional product, making the total products four. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps there's only one product, if the reaction leads to substitution at position 1 (replacing Br with NH2), giving 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But that would be just one product.

Wait, but the question is about how many possible products there are, so I need to consider all possibilities.

Another angle: the starting material has two substituents, and the reaction could lead to substitution or elimination. If substitution leads to 3 products, and elimination leads to 1, that might be 4 products total, but that's assuming both substitution and elimination happen, which might not be the case.

But I'm not sure about the exact number. Alternatively, perhaps elimination doesn't occur, and substitution is the main pathway, leading to three products.

Wait, but the options don't include 4. Wait, no, option A is 4. So, perhaps substitution leads to three products, and elimination leads to one, totaling four.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution leads to two products, and elimination leads to two, but that's speculative.

Wait, another angle: in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the leaving group (Br) is in a position activated by the electron-donating group (NMe2). So, substitution would occur at position 1, replacing Br with NH2, giving one product. That's option B (1 product).

But I'm not sure if that's the only possibility. Alternatively, substitution could also occur at position 3 or 5, leading to multiple products.

But wait, the dimethylamino group is at position 2, so positions 1 and 3 are ortho, and position 5 is para. So, substitution at any of these positions is possible, leading to three products. But considering steric hindrance, perhaps substitution at position 1 (adjacent to NMe2) is less likely, leaving substitution at 3 and 5, leading to two products.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution occurs only at the activated position (para to NMe2), which is position 5. So, only one product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the directing effects again. The NMe2 group is a strong activating group and is ortho/para-directing. So, the nucleophile attacks either ortho or para positions relative to the NMe2.

In the starting material, Br is at position 1 (ortho to NMe2). So, the nucleophilic attack would target the ortho and para positions relative to NMe2.

The ortho positions are 1 and 3. But position 1 is already occupied by Br. So, substitution could happen at position 3 (another ortho site) and position 5 (para site).

Thus, substitution at position 3 and 5 are possible, leading to two products. So, the number of possible products is 2.

But wait, what about substitution at position 1? If the Br leaves, and NH2 takes its place, that's another product. So, that would be three substitution products.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution only occurs at the para position (5), giving one product.

But considering that the nucleophile will attack all possible activated positions, the number of products depends on how many positions are activated and available.

So, let's count:

- The NMe2 group at position 2 activates positions 1, 3 (ortho) and 5 (para).

- Position 1 is occupied by Br, which can be replaced.

- Positions 3 and 5 are available.

So, substitution can occur at positions 1, 3, and 5.

But wait, position 1 is already substituted with Br. So, substitution would replace Br with NH2, giving 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Substitution at position 3 would give 3-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Substitution at position 5 would give 5-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

So, three possible substitution products.

But wait, the starting material has Br and NMe2. So, all three substitution products are possible.

But that would mean three products via substitution. However, the question also mentions possible elimination products.

If elimination occurs, perhaps a fourth product is formed. Let's say elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure, perhaps quinoline or something similar.

Alternatively, elimination could lead to the loss of Br and a hydrogen, forming a diradical that then forms a new structure.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. However, if substitution leads to three products and elimination leads to one, the total would be four.

But I'm not certain about the elimination pathway. Alternatively, perhaps substitution leads to three products, and the question is about substitution only.

Wait, the problem statement says "how many possible organic products are there in this reaction?" So, considering substitution and elimination, if both are possible, the number could be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one major product, so the answer is 1. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to the formation of aniline via substitution. If the Br is replaced by NH2, that would be one product.

But in that case, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene, which is possible but perhaps not the only product.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Based on the substituents and the reaction conditions, I think substitution is the main pathway, leading to three possible products (positions 1,3,5). But considering steric and electronic factors, maybe substitution at position 1 is less likely, leaving substitution at 3 and 5, giving two products. So, the answer would be option C (2).

Wait, but earlier I thought substitution at position 1 is possible, giving three products. So, it's either 2 or 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, leading to a single product (like quinoline). But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a new ring. Let's imagine that the Br and the H are eliminated, forming a new double bond between C1 and C2, but that's in a benzene ring, which is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring expands to a seven-membered ring, but I don't know.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of the possible products.

Option D is 3. So, if substitution occurs at three positions, the answer would be D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single product via substitution at position 1, making the answer B.

But given that the dimethylamino group is activating and the Br is in an ortho position, substitution at the para position (5) is likely. So, perhaps only substitution at position 5, leading to one product. So, the answer would be B.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about elimination, leading to a single product, so the answer is B (1).

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the answer is either B or D. Wait, the question is about how many possible products are formed. If substitution can occur at three positions (1,3,5), and elimination leads to another product, that's four. But I'm not sure if elimination is feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps only one substitution occurs, leading to one product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Benzidine rearrangement. Benzidine is a structure with two adjacent amino groups. But in our case, the substituents are Br and NMe2. So, perhaps the Br is replaced by NH2, leading to a diamine structure. But I'm not sure.

In the Benzidine rearrangement, a dihalobenzene with two leaving groups undergoes elimination to form a diamine. But in our case, we have only one leaving group (Br). So, perhaps that's not applicable.

Hmm. Another approach: the treatment of bromobenzene with NaNH2 in ammonia typically leads to the formation of phenylamine via substitution, but with more substituents, the number of products increases.

In our case, the substituents are Br and NMe2. So, the NH2^- can attack positions activated by NMe2, which are para and ortho.

So, substitution at position 1 (Br), 3, and 5.

So, three substitution products. Plus any elimination products.

But perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination, so substitution is the main pathway, leading to three products.

But the options given are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

So, the correct answer would be D)3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The structure of the starting material has bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2, which are adjacent (ortho) on the benzene ring. The dimethylamino group is a strong electron-donating group (activating, ortho/para-directing), while bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (deactivating, meta-directing). The reaction conditions suggest a nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, where the NH₂⁻ ion acts as a nucleophile.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substitution Pathway**:
   - The dimethylamino group at position 2 strongly activates the ring, directing the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to attack at the ortho (positions 1 and 3) and para (position 5) positions relative to itself.
   - Position 1 is already occupied by bromine, which can act as a leaving group. Substitution at position 1 would replace bromine with an amino group, yielding **1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene**.
   - Substitution at position 3 would introduce an amino group at this ortho position, forming **3-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene**.
   - Substitution at position 5 would introduce an amino group at the para position, forming **5-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene**.
   - Thus, substitution can occur at three positions, leading to three possible substitution products.

2. **Elimination Pathway**:
   - Elimination reactions typically require the removal of a leaving group and a β-hydrogen. While elimination could theoretically occur (e.g., loss of HBr to form a new structure), there is no clear evidence in the given conditions that this pathway is favored. Additionally, the formation of a new ring or rearranged structure (e.g., quinoline-like compounds) is speculative without further details.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The substitution pathway is the most plausible, leading to three distinct products based on the attack of NH₂⁻ at positions 1, 3, and 5.
   - Elimination is unlikely under the given conditions, and no additional products are strongly supported.

### Final Answer:
The reaction produces three possible organic products via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. 

Answer: D
