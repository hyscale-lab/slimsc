Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, the wave function has an imaginary part, 0.5i. Hmm, I remember that the wave function must be normalizable, meaning the integral of the square of the absolute value over all space must be 1. Also, the modulus squared gives the probability density.

But wait, the wave function is written as a function that includes an imaginary component. So, when calculating probabilities, I think we need to find the modulus squared, which is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

Wait, let me write down the wave function. Oh wait, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a / sqrt(1 + x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or wait, is it a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i? So, it's a complex function where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but when you have a wave function in the form ψ(x) = A + Bi, where A and B are real numbers, the complex conjugate is A - Bi. So, the modulus squared is (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B². So the probability density is A² + B². 

But wait, in this problem, when they say the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, I think the entire function is a function of x. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Hmm, but wait, that would mean the imaginary part is a constant, which depends on x only through the real part. But that seems odd because the imaginary part is a function of x, right? Wait, no, unless it's written differently. Wait, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Oh, maybe that's how it's supposed to be read. Because otherwise, the imaginary part is a constant, which would make the probability density depend on x in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I should parse the expression correctly. The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5 i. So, I think that's a function where for each x, the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that would mean that the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) + (-0.5) i. So, the imaginary part is a constant, not depending on x. That's a bit unusual, but let's go with it.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the wave function's modulus squared would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but the problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 and x >3. So the particles are all in the region 1 ≤ x ≤3. That implies that the probability of finding a particle outside this region is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which suggests that the wave function is a non-zero constant for all x. Because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, no, because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), which varies with x. So, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero in that interval, and zero elsewhere. But the given wave function is defined for all x, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero outside of 1 ≤x ≤3, but within that region, it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says that when measuring, none were found outside 1 and 3. So it implies that the wave function is zero outside that interval. So the wave function must be zero for x<1 and x>3, and non-zero otherwise.

But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Which would be non-zero for all x except where the denominator is zero, i.e., x = -1. But that's not the case here. So maybe the wave function is only defined in the region 1 ≤x ≤3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for all x, but the system is such that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero in 1 ≤x ≤3 and zero outside. But the given expression isn't zero outside, so perhaps the entire wave function is expressed as ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i] for 1 ≤x ≤3 and zero otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere. But the problem states that the wave function is as given "in a part of space where it can exist." So perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x) ) -0.5i only in the region where the particle exists, which is 1 ≤x ≤3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but that complicates the normalization. Because the wave function is a complex function with both real and imaginary parts in the allowed region, and zero outside. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from -infty to infty must equal 1.

But since ψ(x) is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, the integral is from 1 to 3.

So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2] for x in [1,3], and zero elsewhere.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

Wait, why? Because modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So ψ(x) = Re + i Im, so |ψ(x)|² = Re² + Im². So in our case, Re is a/(sqrt(1+x)), so Re² is a²/(1+x), and Im is -0.5, so Im² is 0.25. So the integrand becomes a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

∫ [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each separately.

The first integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C.

So from 1 to 3: a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that value. Let me approximate ln(2) as 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

Wait, the integral is:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25] dx

= a^2 * ln(4/2) ) + 0.25*(3-1)

= a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The problem states that particles are only found in the region \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), meaning the wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space equals 1:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Since \( \psi(x) = 0 \) outside \( [1, 3] \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
