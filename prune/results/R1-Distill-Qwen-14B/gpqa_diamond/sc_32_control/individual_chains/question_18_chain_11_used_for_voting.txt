Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me the masses of the stars: Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. But I'm not sure if their masses directly affect the abundance ratios. I think the key here is the given element abundance data using the EW method, which I recall stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm more focused on the [X/Y] notation, which is the logarithmic abundance ratio relative to another element.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the abundance of Si relative to Fe in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3. Let me calculate that: 10^0.3 is about 2, so Si is about twice as abundant compared to Fe as in the Sun? Wait, no, [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So a positive value means X is more abundant than Y relative to the Sun.

Wait, let's get the exact definition. The notation [X/Y] is defined as log10(N_X / N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. So if [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, that means that in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than in the Sun by 10^0.3. So Si is 2 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So in Star_2, Mg/Si is higher than the Sun by 10^0.3. So Mg is about twice as much as Si relative to Star_2.

Wait, but I'm looking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. Oh, wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2. Or wait no, the exact wording is "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." Hmm, so it's [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2]? Or perhaps it's [Si_1 / Si_2]?

Wait, perhaps I should model each star's composition relative to the sun and then compare their Si abundances.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the abundance of each element (Si, Mg, Fe, H) in each star relative to the Sun.

2. Since the Sun's photosphere has known [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], wait, the problem states the Sun's photospheric composition. Let me see:

The Sun's composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 → Wait, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → that can't be right because 7.5 is less than 12. Oh wait, perhaps the equation was written differently. Let me re-express that.

Wait, the notation [X/H] is 12 + log10(n_X/n_H). So for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun = 7.5 → 12 + log10(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 -12 = -4.5.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is 7, so 12 + log10(nMg/nH)_sun =7 → log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7-12= -5.

Wait, but in the problem statement: The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and same for Mg being 7. So that would translate to [Fe/H]_sun =7.5 and [Mg/H]_sun =7.

Wait, no, the [X/H] notation is 12 + log10(n_X/n_H). So the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5, meaning log10(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is 7 → log10(nMg/nH)_sun =7-12= -5.

So for Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 is 0 → which means [Fe/H] is same as the Sun. So log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = log10(nFe/nH)_sun + 0 → same as the Sun's value.

Similarly, Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → so log10(nMg_2/nH_2) = log10(nMg/nH)_sun +0 → same as Sun.

So, Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, so Fe abundance same as Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0, so Mg same as Sun.

But Star_1 has [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → which is log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] =0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, the Sun’s [Mg/Si] ratio: since [Mg/Si]_sun is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) -12 - log10(nSi/nH) = log10(nMg/nH) - log10(nSi/nH) = log10(nMg/nSi) = [Mg/Si]_sun. Wait, but the given data for the Sun's composition is 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 and same for Mg. Wait, I think I might have confused something earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should define each element's abundance in terms of [X/H] and then compute their ratios.

Let me structure this:

For each star, we can find the log abundances relative to the Sun.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → so Fe is same as Sun.

[S_i/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si is more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun by 0.3 dex.

Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg is more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun by 0.3.

So, let's compute the abundance of Si in each star relative to the Sun.

Starting with Star_1:

log10(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log10(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But we know [Fe/H]_1=0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. Let's express each element's abundance as a multiple of the Sun's.

Let’s denote:

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance is same as Sun. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_sun / nH_1) ) * (nH_1 / nH_sun) → Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think in terms of hydrogen.

Wait, for a star, the abundance of an element X is given by [X/H] = 12 + log10(n_X/n_H).

In the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun =7 → log10(nMg/nH)_sun =7-12=-5 → nMg/nH_sun =10^-5.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) + 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

Wait, what's the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio?

The Sun's [Si/Fe]_sun would be log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = log10( (nSi/nH_sun) / (nFe/nH_sun) ) ) = [Si/H]_sun - [Fe/H]_sun.

Wait, [Si/H]_sun =12 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun. But wait, the problem only gives [Fe/H]_sun and [Mg/H]_sun. It doesn't directly give [Si/H]_sun. Hmm, that's a problem. So I can't directly compute the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio because I don't have [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, but the problem statement gives the Sun's photospheric composition as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So perhaps the Sun's [Si/H] is given, but I'm not told? Or maybe I can find it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the [Si/Fe]_sun from known data. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide that. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate it based on the given information.

Wait, perhaps the Sun has a standard composition, and [Fe/H]_sun is 7.5, [Mg/H]_sun is 7. Wait, but maybe the [Si/H]_sun isn't given. So I'm stuck unless I can find it from other data.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed using the elements as variables.

Let's denote:

For the Sun:

log10(nFe/nH) = [Fe/H]_sun -12 =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

log10(nMg/nH) =7-12 =-5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? Since the problem doesn't state it, perhaps I need to find it from other data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, perhaps in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun can be calculated from [Mg/H]_sun and [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = [Mg/H]_sun - [Si/H]_sun.

But I don't have [Si/H]_sun. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the [Mg/Si]_sun is zero because Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Wait, no. Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, same as Sun, but [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, meaning higher than Sun's [Mg/Si].

Wait, maybe I should express the ratios in terms of each other.

Let me try to express nSi in terms of nFe and nMg.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log10(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log10(nMg_2 /nSi_2) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

But I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun. So perhaps I can relate this to the Sun's [Mg/Si] using the given [Mg/H]_sun and [Fe/H]_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun and [Mg/Si]_sun from the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(nMg/nSi)_sun.

But I don't have [Si/H]_sun. So I'm stuck unless I can find another relation.

Hmm, maybe I can model the Sun's composition in terms of Fe, Mg, and Si.

Wait, I have:

nFe/nH =1e-4.5,

nMg/nH =1e-5,

But I don't have nSi/nH. So I'm missing information. Maybe the problem expects me to assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]=0 → Fe is same as Sun.

So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_sun / nH_1). But unless I know the relation between nH_1 and nH_sun, I can't proceed. Wait, but perhaps I can express all abundances in terms of [X/H], which already includes the hydrogen scaling.

Wait, for Star_1:

log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = [Fe/H]_1 =0 → same as Sun.

log10(nSi_1/nH_1) = [Si/H]_1.

Wait, but [Si/Fe]_1 is given as 0.3 → log10(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 is same as Sun's nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_sun /nH_1) → Hmm, but perhaps I can express [Si/H]_1 in terms of [Fe/H]_1 and [Si/Fe]_1.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1.

Because [Si/Fe] is [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

So [Si/H]_1 = 0 +0.3 =0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nH_1) =0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 =10^0.3 ≈2.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

Wait, but I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun. Alternatively, [Mg/Si]_sun is [Mg/H]_sun - [Si/H]_sun.

But without knowing [Si/H]_sun, I can't find it.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the Sun's [Mg/Si] as a separate value, but I don't have it.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given solar [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Let me think.

Wait, [Fe/H]_sun=7.5 → nFe/nH_sun=10^(7.5-12)=10^-4.5.

[Mg/H]_sun=7 → nMg/nH_sun=10^(7-12)=10^-5.

But what about Si? Let's call [Si/H]_sun = x → nSi/nH_sun=10^(x-12).

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(nMg/nSi)_sun = log10( (nMg/nH_sun) / (nSi/nH_sun) ) ) = log10( (10^-5) / (10^(x-12)) ) )= log10(10^(-5 -x +12)) )= (-5 -x +12)=7 -x.

So [Mg/Si]_sun =7 -x.

But without knowing x, I can't proceed. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that [Si/Fe]_sun is zero. But I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing [Si/Fe]_sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can express the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of their respective [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] values.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) → (nSi_1 / nSi_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ).

But I don't know the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Hmm, but perhaps that's not necessary because when I take the ratio of [X/H], the H cancels out? Or maybe not.

Wait, [X/H] is log10(nX/nH). So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = ?

Wait, how do I find [Si/H]_2?

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [Mg/Si] is the ratio of Mg to Si. So if [Mg/Si] is higher than the Sun's by 0.3, then in Star_2, Mg is more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun. So, if [Mg/H] in Star_2 is same as Sun, but [Mg/Si] is higher, then [Si/H] must be lower than the Sun's.

So [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 =0 -0.3 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Wait, but what about the Sun's [Si/H]?

Ah! Wait, the initial data doesn't give [Si/H]_sun, but perhaps it's the same as the Sun's [Si/H], which I can compute from the given data.

Wait, no, the problem gives for the Sun:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → [Fe/H]_sun=7.5.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun=7.

But I don't have [Si/H]_sun. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute it from the given data, but I don't see how. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to realize that [Si/Fe]_sun is [Si/H]_sun - [Fe/H]_sun.

But without knowing [Si/H]_sun, I can't compute that. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to proceed without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], but that seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2 without knowing the absolute abundances.

Wait, the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2 is (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of H in each star. Unless each star has the same H abundance, but I don't think that's a safe assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but the problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed by expressing each star's Si abundance relative to the Sun.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1 = nH_1 * 10^0.3.

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → nSi_2 = nH_2 * 10^-0.3.

So the ratio (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) = 10^(0.3 +0.3) )=10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option A is ~3.9.

So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 3.9.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Did I miss something here?

Wait, let me double-check. 

For Star_1: [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, which is log10(nSi_1/nH_1) =0.3 → nSi_1 =nH_1 *10^0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → log10(nSi_2/nH_2) =-0.3 → nSi_2 =nH_2 *10^-0.3.

Thus, the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) = (nSi_1 * nH_2) / (nH_1 *nSi_2) ) = (10^0.3 * nH_2) / (nH_1 *10^-0.3 ) )= (10^0.6) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ).

But wait, I don't know the ratio of nH_2 to nH_1. How?

Ah, here's a problem. Because the ratio depends on the hydrogen scaling between the two stars, which I don't have any information about. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same overall metallicity, but I don't know.

Wait, no, because Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1=0 and Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0. So perhaps their H is the same as the Sun's, but that's not necessarily true.

Wait, let me think again. The [X/H] is defined as 12 + log10(nX/nH), so if [X/H] is the same, the ratio nX/nH is the same.

But without knowing the actual nH in each star, I can't compute the absolute abundances. But perhaps the question is only about the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2, regardless of H.

Wait, but that's not possible because the ratio depends on nH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think of another way.

Alternative approach:

Express each element’s abundance relative to the Sun.

Let me denote for Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_sun /nH_1).

Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe is same as Sun in terms of [Fe/H], which implies that nFe_1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH_sun / nH_1).

Similarly, nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_sun /nH_2) → because [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, but I don't know how nH_1 and nH_2 relate to each other. So perhaps I can't proceed this way.

Alternatively, perhaps because I'm only comparing [Si], I can express it relative to H.

So, for each star, the abundance of Si is given by [Si/H], which is 0.3 for Star_1 and -0.3 for Star_2.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) )= (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But wait, that's the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 )/(nSi_2/nH_2) → which is (nSi_1 /nH_1) * (nH_2 /nSi_2 ). But this would be the ratio if I'm looking for (nSi_1 /nSi_2) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ).

But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, I can't get nSi_1/nSi_2.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is actually asking for the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star, so the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but that wouldn't make sense because the ratio is about the abundance, not the logarithm.

Wait, the question says: the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that would be (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ) = (nSi_1 *nH_2 )/(nSi_2 *nH_1 ).

But without knowing nH_2/nH_1, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, which isn't stated, but maybe it's a simplification.

If that's the case, then nH_1 =nH_2 → the ratio becomes (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) )= 10^(0.6)= ~3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't state that the stars have the same H abundance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio of Si in the two stars relative to their own H, and then express the ratio of those values.

In that case, the ratio would be (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 )= (10^0.3 )/(10^-0.3 )=10^0.6≈3.98.

So the answer would be approximately 3.9, which is option A.

But wait, is that right? Because if I take the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2, it's (0.3)/(-0.3)= -1. But that's not the case because the actual abundances are exponential.

Wait, no, the ratio is (10^0.3)/(10^-0.3) )=10^(0.6) as I said before.

So, putting it all together, the ratio is approximately 3.98. So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the definitions of stellar abundance ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0: The iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: Silicon is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times more abundant relative to iron than in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0: Magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3: Magnesium is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times more abundant relative to silicon than in the Sun.

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - [Fe/H]_sun = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5.
   - [Mg/H]_sun = 7 → log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 - 12 = -5.

### Step 1: Determine [Si/H] for Each Star
- For **Star_1**:
  - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.
  - Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. Thus, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3.
  - This implies log10(nSi_1/nH_1) = 0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

- For **Star_2**:
  - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + 0.3.
  - Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun. Thus, [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3.
  - This implies log10(nSi_2/nH_2) = -0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 = 10^-0.3 ≈ 0.5.

### Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2 / n_{\text{H}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_1}.
\]

From the abundances:
- \( n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_1 = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \),
- \( n_{\text{Si}}_2 / n_{\text{H}}_2 = 10^{-0.3} \approx 0.5 \).

Assuming the hydrogen abundance scales similarly in both stars (a reasonable simplification given the lack of explicit data), the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

Answer: A
