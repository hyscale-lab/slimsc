Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope setup. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

So the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam, right? But even after doing that, some gas particles are still present, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculates the mean free path λ1 based on factors like the volume, pressure, and temperature of the sample compartment.

Mean free path, as I remember, is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula I think is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density, and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * p), but maybe that's getting more detailed. Alternatively, the mean free path is also related to pressure and temperature. Oh, right, the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * p), where p is pressure.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure and proportional to the temperature. So if pressure decreases, mean free path increases, and higher temperature would increase it too.

In this case, initially, the mean free path is λ1, calculated when the electron beam isn't active. But when the electron beam is turned on, Mike notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. So why would that happen?

The electron beam emits electrons which are moving at a high speed. The gas molecules in the vacuum chamber are moving at thermal velocities, which are much lower than the electrons. So when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The presence of the electron beam might cause interactions with the gas molecules.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves? Hmm. Oh, wait, the mean free path is about how far a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. But in the presence of the electron beam, perhaps the electrons are causing additional scattering or ionization of the gas molecules.

Wait, but the question says Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering with gas molecules. So when the electron beam is on, the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules. So the gas molecules are now undergoing more collisions—either because electrons are making them move differently or because the electrons are causing some sort of excitation that leads to more collisions between gas molecules.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, leading to more interactions. Or maybe the electrons are physically colliding with the gas molecules, thereby altering their movement. But wait, gas molecules are neutral, so unless they're ionized, it's harder for electrons to interact with them directly. But in a vacuum, there's a possibility of electron-molecule interactions, maybe through scattering or charging.

Wait, but the mean free path λ is for the gas molecules (like how far they go before colliding with each other). So if the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are getting bombarded by the electrons, causing more frequent interactions, but wait, the mean free path for the gas molecules would depend on their own collisions, not on the electrons. Unless the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move more, or change their velocity distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being heated. If the temperature increases, the mean free path would increase because λ is proportional to temperature (since higher temperatures mean higher velocities, so molecules move faster, so the average distance between collisions is longer). But in the question, the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So that shouldn't change λ.

Wait, but the temperature is the same as before. So any change in λ must be due to other factors. So why would the mean free path change?

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. The electrons could be causing the gas molecules to become ionized or charged. If the gas molecules become charged, they might interact more with the walls of the sample compartment or with each other. But if they become charged, that could increase the effective cross-section for collisions. Because charged particles attract or repel each other more, so the collision cross-section σ increases. If σ increases, then the mean free path λ decreases, since λ is inversely proportional to σ.

Wait, let's think about that. Mean free path λ = 1/(n σ √2). So if σ goes up, λ goes down. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C says λ2 < λ1.

But wait, why would σ increase? Because the gas molecules are getting charged, perhaps due to the electron beam. Charged particles have higher cross-sections for collisions because they can interact over longer distances. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may acquire charges, leading to larger σ, thus shorter λ. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Alternatively, is there another possibility? Could the electron beam cause the gas molecules to move faster, leading to more collisions? Well, but the temperature is the same, so the thermal velocity shouldn't change. Unless the beam is heating the gas, but the question says temperature remains the same.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be knocked out of the compartment, effectively reducing the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. But Mike's observation was that the mean free path changed, but the pressure is the same because the system is under vacuum. Hmm. Or perhaps the pressure changed because the electron beam affected the gas, but the problem says the pressure is still under 1e-9 Torr, so maybe it's not that.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being ionized, leading to more frequent collisions because ions have different cross-sections. Alternatively, the gas might become partially ionized, which could change the effective pressure or the mean free path. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be scattered more, leading to more frequent collisions. But wait, the mean free path is about the gas molecules colliding with each other, not with the electrons. So if the electrons are just passing by, not actually colliding with the gas molecules, then wouldn't the gas molecules' mean free path remain the same?

Wait, but the question says that Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas. So perhaps the electron beam induces some effect that affects the gas molecules' movement.

Wait a moment. Oh, right, in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules might be more likely to scatter electrons, which could influence their trajectories. But for the gas molecules, their own collisions (with other gas molecules) would still depend on their own velocity and the pressure.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces some electric fields, which could cause the gas molecules to move in a certain way, which might alter their effective density. But if the volume is the same and pressure is same, the number density n would be same, so λ would be same.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about it differently.

In the initial state (electron beam off), the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path changes to λ2.

If the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move more, but the temperature is the same, that doesn't change their thermal velocities. So their own collision rate shouldn't change, so λ1 would equal λ2.

Wait, but that's option B, which says λ2 equals λ1. But Mike observed a change, so that would indicate a discrepancy, implying that B is not the correct option. But the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1, so option B is not correct.

Wait, but what if the presence of the electron beam causes some gas molecules to be removed from the compartment? For example, if the beam is causing the gas to be pumped out more quickly, then the pressure would decrease, leading to an increase in the mean free path. But the question says that the pressure is still less than 1e-9 Torr, so maybe the pressure didn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam increases the temperature, but the question states that the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more energetic, which affects their movement. But if the temperature is the same, the average kinetic energy is the same, so their velocities don't change.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path also depends on the effective cross-section. If the electron beam somehow changes the cross-section, perhaps by ionizing the gas, then the cross-section would increase, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, let's think about that. Suppose the gas is hydrogen. If the electron beam ionizes some of the H2 molecules into H+ ions (protons), then the H+ ions have a higher charge, so their effective cross-section for collisions would be larger. So when the electron beam is on, more gas molecules are ionized, leading to a higher σ. So λ = 1/(n σ √2). So with higher σ, λ decreases.

Thus, λ2 would be less than λ1, so option C.

But wait, what if the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move apart, effectively reducing the number density n? But if the pressure is the same, n is the same. Because n is proportional to pressure divided by (k*T), and pressure and temperature are the same, n is same.

So, the only way λ can change is if σ changes. So when the electron beam is on, if the gas is ionized, σ increases, λ decreases.

Therefore, λ2 < λ1.

So the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves understanding the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path as λ1 based on factors such as pressure, temperature, and volume. However, upon turning on the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. The task is to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.

The mean free path, λ, is inversely proportional to the product of the number density (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), i.e., \( \lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma \sqrt{2}} \). Since the pressure and temperature remain constant, the number density \( n \) does not change. Therefore, any variation in λ must be due to a change in the collision cross-section \( \sigma \).

When the electron beam is active, it can ionize the gas molecules. Ionized gas molecules acquire charges, which increase their effective collision cross-section \( \sigma \). This is because charged particles interact more strongly with each other, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions. As a result, the mean free path \( \lambda \) decreases because \( \lambda \) is inversely proportional to \( \sigma \). Thus, \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

The observation that \( \lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1 \) rules out the possibility of no change (option B). The decrease in \( \lambda \) due to increased \( \sigma \) supports the conclusion that \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \), making option C the correct choice.
