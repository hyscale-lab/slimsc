Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some transfection techniques. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the molecular biology details, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question describes an experiment where a researcher is looking at a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate. So, they've probably used some sort of reporter system to track where these proteins are expressed.

The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? So, they've got two ORFs here: the ligand is at the 5' end, and the receptor at the 3'. Each is fused to a fluorescent marker. So ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, and the receptor has eGFP at the C-terminus.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA stands for chicken beta-actin, which is a strong promoter. So the ligand should be expressed from that. The receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Oh, right, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which means the two ORFs can be co-expressed but independently. So the ligand is under CBA promoter, and the receptor is under IRES.

Wait, but here's the thing. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, the idea is that without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the fluorescent proteins from being expressed. Because when you have the ORF followed by a stop and then another gene, unless the stop is removed, the second gene won't be expressed. Oh wait, no, in this case, perhaps the stop is in between the ORF and the fluorescent marker. So, without Cre, the stop would prevent the fluorescent proteins from being made.

But using Cre would recombine the loxP sites. Wait, loxP is a site recognized by Cre, which causes recombination. So, if the ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, which would prevent the mCherry from being expressed unless Cre is present to excise the stop. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, so perhaps the ligand and receptor are expressed as separate proteins. The stop cassettes are between the ORF and the fluorescent markers. So, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry, but without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly for the receptor.

When Cre is introduced, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed. But wait, another thought: sometimes, IRES elements are used to have two separate proteins expressed from a single mRNA. So the first ORF is under the CBA promoter, and the second (receptor) is under the IRES, which is a weaker promoter but allows for its own translation.

Now, the researcher made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest derivatives. So when the offspring are born, they have the Cre active in those cells where the SOX10 is active.

They visualize the mice under a confocal microscope, looking for green signal (eGFP). But they didn't see any. So why is that?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act locally. If they're paracrine, perhaps the ligand acts on nearby cells, so the receptor might not be expressed in the same cells as the ligand. But I'm not sure how this relates to the expression of GFP. If the Cre is active, the eGFP should be expressed, right? Unless the expression is not happening because of the construct.

B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So, it's not being transported to the cell surface, thus not fluorescent. But how would that happen? The eGFP is at the C-terminus, so maybe the protein is not processed correctly. But the question says the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So when they did Western blot, I'm not sure if they saw the eGFP. Wait, the question says they used the antibodies to test construct expression on Western blot. So if the eGFP wasn't expressed, that would have shown up as a problem earlier. But perhaps the Western blot used a different approach, but the fact that the eGFP wasn't expressed in the mouse suggests that the construct wasn't properly processed. But the question is about why there's no green signal, so maybe the problem is with the construct's expression.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so it should be expressed regardless of enhancers. Unless the enhancer is needed for expression in a specific tissue. But the mouse model was made in a wt background, so maybe the construct doesn't have the necessary regulatory elements for expression in neural crest cells. But the vector uses strong promoters, so perhaps this isn't the issue.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, right! The stop cassettes can affect the reading frame. Let's think: the construct is ligand ORF followed by stop in loxP, then mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with IRES, then stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no. The vector is bicistronic, so the two ORFs are in separate cassettes.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when Cre is introduced, it excises the stops, but if the lox sites are in the wrong configuration, it might cause issues. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites. Cre can recognize loxP, and sometimes lox2272 is a variant. Wait, lox2272 is a site that is recognized by Cre but with a different recombination outcome. I think lox2272 is a 'floxed' site that can be used for conditional expression. But in this vector, the ligand has a stop between it and mCherry, which is flanked by loxP sites. The receptor has a stop between it and eGFP, flanked by lox2272 sites.

So when Cre is introduced, it would excise the loxP-stop in the ligand's cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed. And for the receptor, would the Cre with lox2272 work? Wait, does Cre recognize lox2272? Or does it require a different recombinase? Because I remember that lox2272 is a site that is recognized by Cre, but in a way that it can also distinguish between different sites. Wait, but if the Cre is expressed, it should recognize both loxP and lox2272 sites and excise the stops.

Wait, but in the construct, the ligand is in front of a loxP-stop, and the receptor has lox2272-stop. So when Cre is active, both stops would be excised, and both mCherry and eGFP would be expressed. But in the experiment, the eGFP is not being expressed. So why?

Wait, in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous. They crossed them to SOX10-Cre, which is under the control of the SOX10 promoter, so Cre is only expressed in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, Cre should excise the stops, leading to expression of mCherry (from the ligand) and eGFP (from the receptor). But they see no green signal. So maybe the receptor and eGFP are not being co-expressed.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, how could that happen? Oh, because in the original construct, if the stop is flanked by lox sites, and when Cre excises it, the reading frame of the ORF must be preserved. If the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed.

Wait, but the construct is designed such that the receptor ORF is followed by a stop cassette. So when Cre excises the stop, the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor ORF. If the stop is in frame, then perhaps the eGFP is added without a frame shift. But if the stop is not in frame, excising it might cause a frame shift, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but the stop is in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ORF is followed by a stop codon, then the lox sites. So the stop is in frame, so when Cre excises the lox sites and the stop, the ORF of the receptor is correctly in frame with eGFP. So that should allow eGFP to be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in the middle of the coding sequence, but that's unlikely because the stop would terminate translation. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not working. Because the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor. Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So when the mRNA is made, the ribosome reads the ligand ORF, stops at the stop, then the IRES allows another ribosome to read the receptor ORF.

But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed. So for the ligand, the ORF is followed directly by mCherry, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. For the receptor, the ORF is followed directly by eGFP.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that when Cre is introduced, the loxP and lox2272 sites are in different locations, but the vector has the two stops in different sites. So, perhaps the Cre isn't excising the stop for the receptor. Or maybe the Cre isn't active in the right cells.

Wait, but the Cre is under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, Cre should be active, and the stops should be excised, allowing the eGFP and mCherry to be expressed.

So why is there no green signal? Let's see the options again.

Option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are in a way that when Cre excises, the reading frame is disrupted. Oh, wait, because loxP is used for the ligand's stop and lox2272 for the receptor's stop. So when Cre recombines, it removes the stop for the ligand, but for the receptor, maybe the lox2272 is a different site that doesn't allow proper recombination.

Wait, I think loxP and lox2272 are different sites. Cre recognizes both, but the way they recombine might differ. I think lox2272 is a site that doesn't allow Cre to recombine in the same way as loxP. Oh wait, lox2272 is designed to be a 'floxed' site that only Cre can recognize. But when you have loxP and lox2272, Cre can actually mediate recombination between them, but the product is a site called lox2272-P. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses two different lox sites, which might not be compatible. So the Cre might not be able to excise both stops.

Wait, in the vector, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP sites, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272 sites. So when Cre is introduced, it would excise the loxP sites around the ligand's stop, but maybe not the lox2272 sites around the receptor's stop. Because maybe Cre cannot recognize lox2272 as efficiently as loxP. Or perhaps the lox2272 site isn't efficiently excised by Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that both lox sites are in the same orientation. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The ligand has a stop cassette with loxP on both ends. The receptor has a stop cassette with lox2272 on both ends. So when Cre is expressed, it should recognize the loxP sites and excise the ligand's stop. Similarly, it should recognize the lox2272 sites and excise the receptor's stop. So both stops should be removed, allowing expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But maybe the lox sites are in a way that when Cre recombines, it doesn't remove the stops correctly. For example, if the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, the stop might not be excised.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes were not correctly placed in the vector. Like, for the ligand, the stop is between the ORF and mCherry, and for the receptor, the stop is between the ORF and eGFP. So when Cre excises, the ORF and the fluorescent protein should be in frame.

But maybe the construct isn't in the correct reading frame. Wait, that's option D. The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when Cre removes the stop, the ORF of the receptor is followed by eGFP, but if the stop was in frame, removing it would make the receptor's coding sequence followed by eGFP's in the same frame. But if the stop wasn't in frame, then the eGFP might be out of frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but the stop is in the loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the stop is placed in frame after the receptor's ORF. So when Cre excises the lox sites and the stop, the receptor's ORF is in frame with the eGFP. So that's correct.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working properly. Because the receptor is under the IRES, which is supposed to allow its own translation. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed at all, regardless of the stop cassettes.

Wait, but the IRES is upstream of the receptor. If the IRES isn't working, then the receptor's ORF wouldn't be translated. But if the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, perhaps the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

Wait, but the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed in the offspring, so the issue is with the receptor's expression.

Alternatively, maybe the vector wasn't correctly designed. For instance, the stop cassette for the receptor isn't correctly placed so that when Cre is introduced, it doesn't allow the eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, another angle: The vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning it's designed to express two proteins from a single mRNA. The first ORF is under the CBA promoter, the second under the IRES. So, the mRNA is made from the CBA promoter, and the IRES allows ribosomes to translate the second ORF.

But the presence of the stop cassettes complicates this. So, without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the fluorescent proteins from being expressed because the stop codon is in between the ORF and the fluorescent marker. But with Cre, the stops are removed, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, they're using a lox-Cre system. So when the Cre is introduced (via the SOX10-Cre mice), the stops should be excised. So, in the neural crest cells, which express SOX10 and thus Cre, the stops should be gone, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But why isn't eGFP being expressed? The Western blot part was with primary astrocyte culture, but the question says that the blot used total proteins. Wait, the question says that the researcher tested the construct expression on Western blot after transfection to primary astrocytes. But the mouse model is a separate experiment.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the vector isn't correctly expressed in the cells. For example, the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't being expressed. Or the CBA promoter isn't working, but that seems less likely because it's a strong promoter.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are preventing the expression of the eGFP. But the Cre should have removed the stops.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the vector is designed such that the lox sites are in a way that when Cre is introduced, the stops are not removed. Alternatively, maybe the stops were not flanked by lox sites correctly, so Cre can't excise them.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being translated because the stop cassette wasn't excised, so the stop is still present. But why would that happen if Cre is active?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 site isn't efficiently recognized by Cre. I remember that lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, which Cre can still recognize, but sometimes the recombination efficiency is lower. Or perhaps the vector uses a site that Cre can't efficiently recombine, leaving the stop intact.

So, in that case, the receptor's stop isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the construct would have the ligand's stop excised, allowing mCherry, but the receptor's stop remains, so no eGFP.

If that's the case, then option D isn't the issue. The issue is that the stop isn't excised because Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites.

But the options don't mention that. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's look again at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Which would cause the eGFP not to be expressed, leading to no green signal. But I thought the stop is in frame, so when it's removed, the frame is preserved.

Hmm. Another angle: The vector is designed as ligand- stop (loxP) - mCherry, and receptor - stop (lox2272) - eGFP. So, when Cre is introduced, it excises the stop from the ligand, but not the receptor's, because the lox sites are different. So, the ligand's mCherry is expressed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't.

But why would the Cre not excise the lox2272 site? I thought Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272 sites.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 site is a 'floxed' site that Cre can only excise when there's another lox2272 site nearby, but if it's paired with a loxP, perhaps it doesn't recombine. I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the vector has two different stop cassettes with different lox sites, and the Cre is only able to excise one of them. So, the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But then why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop is still there between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor's ORF would terminate at the stop, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But in that case, option C is about the enhancer being missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which should be sufficient.

Wait, but the question is about why the eGFP isn't being expressed. So, the possible reasons are either the construct isn't working, the stops aren't being excised, or the proteins aren't being processed.

Wait, another thought: the vector might have the ligand and receptor in the same transcriptional unit, but with the stops in between. So, when Cre excises, both are expressed. But perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. Because if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor's ORF isn't translated, regardless of the stop.

But then, why would the mCherry be expressed? Because the ligand is under CBA, so it's translated, and the stop is excised, allowing the mCherry to be expressed. So in the mouse model, the ligand's mCherry would be expressed in neural crest cells, but the receptor's eGFP wouldn't.

But the question says that the eGFP isn't observed. So, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the stop is flanked by lox sites, so even if the IRES works, without excising the stop, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but the IRES is for the receptor. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So, the ligand's mRNA is made, the receptor's mRNA is made from the same transcript via the IRES. So, without the stop, the eGFP would be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not functional, so the receptor is not being expressed. But the ligand is being expressed. So, the mCherry would be expressed in the same cells as the ligand, but the eGFP wouldn't be.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse wasn't expressing eGFP, but perhaps the mCherry is expressed. But the question doesn't mention seeing red.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the vector doesn't allow both proteins to be expressed. But the setup is for them to be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the IRES is in the wrong place. For example, the IRES is after the ligand's ORF, which might prevent the receptor's expression. Or perhaps it's a question of the vector's design.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is in the wrong orientation. Oh, that's another possibility. If the IRES is in the wrong direction, then the receptor's ORF wouldn't be translated. But the question states that the IRES is upstream of the receptor, which suggests it's correctly placed.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about each option again and see which makes the most sense.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So, ligand is secreted by one cell and acts on another. But the question is about the same cell expressing both. If they are paracrine, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere, but that doesn't directly explain why the eGFP isn't expressed in the same cells.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So, perhaps the protein isn't transported to the cell membrane, so it's not fluorescent. But the Western blot would probably show the eGFP as a band. Since the question says actin loading is proportional, the blot was successful, but maybe the eGFP isn't detected. Alternatively, if the protein is retained in the Golgi, it might not be detected on the Western blot if the antibody can't access it. But I'm not sure if this is the case here.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, so it shouldn't need an enhancer. The receptor is under IRES, which is internal ribosome entry, so perhaps it doesn't require a strong enhancer.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So, when the stop is excised, the reading frame is incorrect, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional eGFP. But if the stop was in frame, excising it would make the reading frame correct. Unless the cassette was not in frame.

Wait, perhaps the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop in a frame that, when excised, puts mCherry in frame. Similarly, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop in frame with eGFP. So, both should be correctly in frame.

Wait, another possibility: the vector's design has the ligand's ORF followed by a stop, then mCherry. The stop is flanked by loxP sites. So, when Cre is introduced, the stop is excised, and the ligand's ORF is directly followed by mCherry. So, mCherry would be expressed in frame. Similarly, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop flanked by lox2272, which when excised, would allow eGFP to be expressed in frame. So, assuming everything is correct, both should be expressed.

But if the lox2272 sites aren't excised by Cre, the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 sites are in the opposite orientation relative to the loxP sites, so Cre can't excise them. Or perhaps the vector uses a different strain of Cre that doesn't recognize lox2272 as efficiently as loxP.

Alternatively, maybe the lox sites are in a way that their recombination leads to the eGFP being out of frame.

Wait, another thought: loxP and lox2272 are different sites in terms of their sequences, so Cre might not be able to efficiently recombine between them. So, if the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP sites and the receptor's by lox2272, Cre might only excise the loxP sites, leaving the lox2272 sites intact. So, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

If that's the case, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop wasn't excised. But why would that happen? Because Cre only excises loxP sites and not lox2272. But I thought Cre can recognize both, but perhaps with lower efficiency for lox2272.

So, in the mouse model, only the ligand's stop is excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. So, the researcher would see red (mCherry) but not green (eGFP).

Wait, but the question says they didn't see any green signal. So, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the stop isn't excised.

But looking at the options, none directly address the issue of Cre not excising the lox2272 sites.

Wait, another angle: the vector uses a bicistronic design, with the ligand ORF first, then the receptor ORF. The ligand is under CBA, the receptor under IRES. The stops are in between the ORFs and the fluorescent markers. Now, the problem could be that the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed, regardless of the stops.

If the IRES isn't working, then the receptor's ORF isn't translated, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the reason for no green signal is because the receptor isn't expressed.

But why would that be the case? Because the IRES isn't working. So, the answer would be option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. But wait, the ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, not an enhancer. So, the enhancer might be needed for the receptor's expression, but the IRES is supposed to drive its own translation.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional in the construct, leading to the receptor not being expressed. But the options don't mention anything about IRES functionality.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because the stop is flanked by lox sites, but when it's excised, the reading frame is incorrect, leading to a frame shift and no eGFP expression.

Wait, but I thought that the stop was in frame. So, when the stop is removed, the reading frame is preserved. So, the eGFP would be in frame. So, unless the stop was in a different frame, which would cause a frame shift, but the stop was designed to be in frame. So perhaps option D isn't the issue.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

The main issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed. Two possibilities: either the stop isn't excised, or the eGFP isn't in frame.

If the stop isn't excised, then the eGFP isn't expressed. Why wouldn't the stop be excised? Because the lox sites aren't recognized.

If the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre, the stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed. But in that case, the answer would be that the lox sites aren't recognized, leading to the stop remaining. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly designed. For example, the ligand and receptor are in the same transcriptional unit, but the stops are in between. So, when Cre excises, perhaps the receptor's ORF is followed by eGFP, but in the wrong frame.

So, it's either the stop isn't excised (so option B or C) or the frame is wrong (option D). Since the question's options don't directly address the lox site recognition, perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame, leading to no eGFP expression.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the IRES isn't functional, leading to no eGFP expression. But the options don't mention IRES.

Wait, the question says that the construct is a bicistronic vector with the ligand ORF at 5' and receptor at 3', with IRES upstream of the receptor. So, the mRNA is made, and the IRES allows the receptor's ORF to be translated. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor's ORF isn't translated, so no eGFP.

So, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working, which is a regulatory issue. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: enhancer missing. But the IRES is a regulatory element, not an enhancer.

Another thought: the ligand and receptor are under different regulatory elements. The ligand is under CBA, which is strong, and the receptor is under IRES. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the receptor's ORF isn't translated.

But again, the options don't directly address this.

Given the options, the best fit seems to be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So, when Cre excises the stop, the frame is wrong, and eGFP isn't expressed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP. Stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP, respectively, in the absence of Cre. Upon crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies that the ligand acts on neighboring cells, but this does not explain why eGFP is not expressed in the same cells where Cre is active (neural crest cells). This option does not address the lack of eGFP expression.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface and would not fluoresce. However, this would not prevent the eGFP protein from being expressed and detected in a Western blot. Since the question does not mention any issues with Western blot detection, this is unlikely to be the cause.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which should ensure sufficient expression. The receptor is under the IRES element, which allows independent translation. While the IRES might not function optimally, the question does not provide evidence that the enhancer or IRES is the issue. This option does not directly explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The stop cassette flanking the receptor ORF is designed to be in frame, allowing proper translation of eGFP after Cre excision. However, if the stop cassette is not in frame, excising it could cause a frame shift, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional eGFP. This would result in no green signal, making this the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP after Cre excision of the stop cassette.

**Answer: D**
