Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then finding the average value of an operator. Alright, I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the state given is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, wait, I remember that when a state is proportional to something, it means it's a scalar multiple. So to find the actual state, I need to normalize it. Right, because probabilities should sum to 1.

So let me write this out. Let me denote |alpha> as c1|up> + c2|down>, where c1 is (1+i) and c2 is (2 - i). To normalize, I need to compute the norm squared of this state. The norm is the inner product of the state with itself.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So |c1| is the magnitude of (1+i), which is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2). So |c1|^2 is (sqrt(2))^2=2.

Similarly, c2 is (2 - i), so the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). So |c2|^2 is 5.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. No, no, actually, the inner product for c1 is (1+i)(1 -i) multiplied by the inner product of |up> with itself, which is 1. Similarly for c2.

Wait, no. To compute |c1|^2, it's (1+i)*(1-i) = (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 1 -i +i -i^2. The i terms cancel, and -i^2 is -(-1)= +1. So 1+1=2. So |c1|^2 is 2.

Similarly, |c2|^2 is (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i^2. The 2i and -2i cancel, and -i^2 is +1. So 4 +1=5. So |c2|^2 is 5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Alright, so |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, but normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij. The matrix is defined as A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down, which are two states.

So the operator matrix would be:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Because for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1, it's hbar/2. The diagonals (i=j) are zero.

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

Hmm, what kind of operator is this? Oh, wait, the Pauli matrices. Well, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix is similar but scaled by hbar/2.

So the operator can be written as (hbar/2) * X, where X is the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, but let me think about the eigenstates of this operator. Because the measurement probabilities depend on the eigenstates of the operator. So the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state |alpha>.

So I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, its eigenstates are the same as those of X.

The eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1, with eigenvectors (1,0) and (0,1) rotated by 90 degrees, or wait, no. Wait, the eigenvectors for X are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, wait, let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Let's see: A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy:

det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[-λ    hbar/2     ]
[ hbar/2  -λ      ]

The determinant is λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 =0 → λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ= ± hbar/2.

Oh, wait, so the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for each eigenvalue can be found. Let's take λ = hbar/2.

Then, (A - (hbar/2) I ) |v> =0.

Matrix:

[-hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  -hbar/2 ]

So the equations are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2=0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). So normalized, it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2.

Matrix:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  hbar/2 ]

Equations:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2=0 → v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

Eigenvector: (1, -1), normalized: (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of operator A are:

|+A> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-A> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, we need to find the inner products of |alpha> with |+A> and |-A>.

Let me compute them.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, compute the inner product < +A | alpha >.

|+A> is [ |up> + |down> ] / sqrt(2).

So, < +A | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, let me write it out:

< +A | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( (1-i)(1+i) )/(sqrt(7)) ) + ( (1)(2 - i) + (i)(2 -i) )/(sqrt(7)) ) ]? Wait, no, perhaps I should compute each term.

Wait, better to compute component-wise.

The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, wait. Because when you take the inner product, you have <up| multiplied by (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down| multiplied by (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So, < +A | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i) (1 + i) / sqrt(7) + (1) (2 - i) / sqrt(7) ]

Wait, no, actually:

Wait, let me clarify. The inner product < +A | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| (1+i)/sqrt(7) > + <down| (2 - i)/sqrt(7) > ]

Because |+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i) * (1+i) )/(sqrt(7)) ) + (1) * (2 -i) )/(sqrt(7)) ) ]

Wait, no, more accurately:

Each term is < up | (1+i)/sqrt(7) | up > + < down | (2 - i)/sqrt(7) | down >, but wait, no. Wait, no—when you take the inner product of |+A> and |alpha>, it's:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

Because |+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

So combine the terms:

[(1+i) + (2 - i)] / sqrt(7) → 1+i +2 -i = 3 → numerator is 3, denominator sqrt(7). Multiply by 1/sqrt(2): (3)/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

So < +A | alpha > = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, the inner product squared is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14. So the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is 9/14.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate this part.

Wait, let's compute the inner product step by step.

The state |+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

The state |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i)(1 + i) + (1)(2 - i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is:

<+A | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) * |alpha>

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

<up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

<down|alpha> is (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So adding these:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + 2 + i -i = 3.

So <+A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (3)/sqrt(7) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability is | <+A| alpha> |^2 = (3^2)/(14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64 when rounded.

Now, the other inner product is < -A | alpha >.

| -A > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 -i)(1+i) - (1)(2 - i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, same as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i )= (-1) + 2i.

So:

( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) → (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (14) ) = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. But 9 +5 is 14, so they add up to 1. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is close to 0.36.

So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36. That matches option A's first two numbers.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

The average value is the expectation value <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Because A is the operator.

We can compute this in two ways. Either expand the matrix product and compute the expectation, or use the fact that the eigenstates are |+A> and |-A>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So:

<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2) )

Which simplifies to:

(9hbar/(28)) - (5hbar/(28)) ) = (4 hbar)/(28) ) = hbar/(7).

So the average value is hbar/7.

Which matches option A's third value, which is hbar/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

So answer A.

Wait, but I thought option D had 0.61, 0.29. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the inner product calculation.

Wait, another approach: compute |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

We have |alpha> = a |+A> + b | -A>,

so |alpha> = [ <+A | alpha> ] |+A> + [ <−A | alpha> ] |−A>.

We found a = 3/sqrt(14), and b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but when calculating the probability, it's |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So |a|^2 is (3^2)/(14) )=9/14.

|b|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14.

Yes, so 9/14 and 5/14.

9/14 is approximately 0.642857 (≈0.64), and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571 (≈0.36).

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option D has probabilities 0.61 and 0.29. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization factor.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the normalization of |alpha>.

Original state: (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 = (1+1) + (4 + 1) )= 2 +5=7.

So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is correctly normalized as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product with |+A>?

Wait, let's compute it again.

< +A | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

<up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

<down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, sum is (1+i + 2 -i ) =3.

Divide by sqrt(7), multiply by 1/sqrt(2) → 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) )=3/sqrt(14).

So the square is 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Yes, that's correct.

So the average value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9 -5]/(28) hbar =4/(28) hbar = hbar/7.

So option A's third part is correct.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and finding the average value of \( A \) for a given quantum state \( |\alpha\rangle \). The state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), and the operator \( A \) has a matrix representation with diagonal elements \( 0 \) and off-diagonal elements \( \hbar/2 \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+A\rangle = (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle)/\sqrt{2} \) and \( |-A\rangle = (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle)/\sqrt{2} \), with eigenvalues \( +\hbar/2 \) and \( -\hbar/2 \), respectively.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, calculate the squared norm:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate probabilities of measuring \( +\hbar/2 \) and \( -\hbar/2 \)
The probabilities correspond to the squared magnitudes of the inner products of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with the eigenstates \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \).

#### Probability of \( +\hbar/2 \):
\[
\langle +A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]
Substitute \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \):
\[
\langle +A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+\hbar/2) = \left| \langle +A | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

#### Probability of \( -\hbar/2 \):
\[
\langle -A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]
Substitute \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \):
\[
\langle -A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-\hbar/2) = \left| \langle -A | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the average value of \( A \)
The average value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+\hbar/2) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\hbar/2) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute \( P(+\hbar/2) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-\hbar/2) = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities of measuring \( +\hbar/2 \) and \( -\hbar/2 \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). This matches **Option A**.
