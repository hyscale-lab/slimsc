Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the orbital parameters and the sizes of the star and planet.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, both have circular orbits. Wait, the host stars: the one with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so it's bigger, but wait, no, the problem says they have the same radii. Interesting.

So the goal is to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I think the probability of transit depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, as well as the orbital distance. The formula I vaguely remember is something like P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), considering that the orbital plane is edge-on. Oh, right, the probability is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because the planet has to pass in front, so the chance is that the distance (semi-major axis) is much larger than the star's size. 

Wait, the formula I think is: P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (R_star / a) )) ? Or maybe it's just R_star/(2a) multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, I think the probability is approximately (R_star)/(a), but scaled by some function based on the planet's size. Oh wait, the actual formula for the probability that a planet transits is given by (R*/a) where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But that's an approximation. Wait, more accurately, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by some factors. Alternatively, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_planet / M_star)^2))), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think about the geometry.

The transit happens when the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on relative to us. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle to cause a transit, relative to all possible angles. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R*)/(a) multiplied by (1/(R* + R_p)) )? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, let me think again. The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p sin i)/(M_* + M_p)) )) but since both planets have the same mass and their host stars have similar masses, perhaps the sin i term averages out. Alternatively, I think the main factors are the size of the star, the distance of the planet, and the size of the planet. But in this question, the planet radius isn't given, but the mass is. Since the masses of the planets are the same, but the stars have different masses, the relation between the planet's size and the star's size depends on their densities. Oh wait, the problem only gives the masses and radii of the stars, not the planets. Hmm, but the transit probability actually depends on the planet's radius relative to the star. Oh, but without knowing the planet sizes, but given that both planets have the same mass, we can't directly know their radii unless we have more info. Oh wait, but the question doesn't mention the planet radii. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, the question is about the probability to transit, which depends on the orbital distance and the relative sizes.

Wait, perhaps the key variables are the star's radius and the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (1/(1 + (R_planet / R_star)) ), but again, I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, the probability for a transit is given by (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_*) ) ), but I'm not confident about that. Maybe another approach.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (1 + (M_p / M_* )) / (1 + M_p / M_* )^2 )? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing up some factors.

Wait, perhaps the probability is simply (R_star / a), assuming that the planet's orbit is random. Because the planet must pass through a small region in front of the star, which is a circle with radius R_star. The area where the transit can occur is a circle with radius R_star, and the total possible area (the star's disk) is π(R_* + R_p)^2, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, for a circular orbit, the probability that we see a transit is approximately (R_* / a), where a is the semi-major axis, assuming that the orbital inclination is random. So, P ~ R*/a.

But wait, another factor is the impact parameter, which depends on the alignment. But the maximum probability is when the orbit is edge-on, which is when the planet transits. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis.

Wait, I think I should get back to the basics. The transit occurs when the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability of this alignment is determined by the ratio of the size of the area where this can happen to the total possible area.

The area where a transit can happen is a circle with radius R_star (the star's radius). The total possible area (the cross-section of the star's orbit) is π a^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not right. The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a. The area where a transit can occur is the area of the star's disk, π R_*, because the planet must cross in front of the star. So the probability is the ratio of the area where transit occurs (π R_*^2) to the area of the planet's orbit (π a^2), but that can't be right because a is much larger than R_*, so the probability would be (R_*)^2 / a^2, which is very small, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, no. The probability isn't about areas but about the angular size. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet's path must pass in front of the star, which requires that the orbital plane is edge-on. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis times some factor.

Wait, I think the standard formula for the transit probability is P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but considering that a >> R_*, we can approximate it as P ≈ (R_* / a). But again, without knowing R_p, the planet's radius, we can't be certain. Oh, but wait, the question doesn't provide planet radii, so perhaps the planet sizes are the same? Or it's irrelevant because the probability is more determined by the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the question says both planets are Earth-like. So perhaps we can assume that their radii are similar to Earth's, which is much smaller than their host stars. So R_p << R_*, so R_p can be neglected. Therefore, the transit probability is approximately R_* / a.

So, in this scenario, the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) for each planet.

Now, let's compute (R_*/a) for both Planet_1 and Planet_2.

We need to find for each planet: (R_* / a).

But wait, a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. So a^3 = (G (M_*) P^2 )/(4 π^2 ), so a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

But perhaps we can relate a_1 and a_2.

Given that Planet_1 has an orbital period P1 = (1/3) P2.

The host of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 M2, and the host of Planet_2 has mass M2.

We can compute a1 and a2.

a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So a_1 = [ (G M1 (P1)^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a_2 = [ (G M2 (P2)^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

We can express a_1 in terms of a_2.

Since P1 = (1/3) P2, so P1^2 = (1/9) P2^2.

M1 = 2 M2.

So a_1 = [ (G * 2 M2 * (P2^2 /9) ) / (4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

a_2 = [ (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So a_1 = [ (2/9) * (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Taking the ratio a_1 / a_2:

[ (2/9) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^1/3 / (9)^1/3 ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606

Alternatively, exact calculation. Let's compute it:

a_1 = [ (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) * [ G/(4 π^2) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 M2 P2^2 ) /9 ]^(1/3 ) * [G/(4 π^2)]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9)^(1/3) ) ] * [M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 ) * [G/(4 π^2)]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a_2 is [ M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 ) * [G/(4 π^2)]^(1/3 )

So a_1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a_2

(2/9) is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606.

So a_1 ≈ 0.606 a_2.

Now, the transit probability is R_* / a.

For Planet_1: (R1 / a1 )

For Planet_2: (R2 / a2 )

But both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2. So R is same.

So, (R / a1 ) = R / (0.606 a2 ) = (1/0.606) * (R / a2 )

Which is approximately 1.65 * (R/a2 )

So, the probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Wait, because (R/a1) = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2 )

Since (R/a2) is the probability for Planet_2, Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times higher.

So, Planet_1 has a higher probability, and the factor is about 1.65 times.

Looking at the options, option C says:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

Alternatively, let me make sure I didn't mix up the factors.

Wait, let's re-calculate. Let's compute a_1 and a_2.

Given that M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So a_1 is proportional to [ M1 * P^2 ]^(1/3 )

a_1 = (2 M2 )^(1/3) * ( (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3 )

= (2)^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) * (P2^2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3 )

= (2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3)) ) * (M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 )

a_2 is (M2 P2^2)^(1/3 )

So the ratio a_1 / a_2 = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3 )

Compute 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

3^(2/3) = (3^(1/3))^2 ≈ (1.442)^2 ≈ 2.08.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 is about 0.606 a_2.

Thus, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R / a_1) = R/(0.606 a_2 ) = 1/0.606 * (R/a_2 ) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a_2 )

Which is the probability for Planet_2.

So Planet_1 has 1.65 times the probability of Planet_2.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

Yes, that's correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same mass and their host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \), which depends on the orbital period and the mass of the host star.

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period and Mass
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_* \) as:

\[
a \propto \left( M_* \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \).
- Planet_2 has \( M_{*,2} \) and \( P_2 \).

Substituting these values, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_{*,1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes
The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately:

\[
\left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

### Step 3: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting compared to Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1 due to its ~1.65 times higher transit probability.
