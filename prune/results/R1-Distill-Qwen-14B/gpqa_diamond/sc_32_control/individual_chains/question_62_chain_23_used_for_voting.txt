Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I need to pick the correct sequence of reagents from the four options provided.

Hmm, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a group that's cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl. Also, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at the same carbon as the cyclohexyl group. So, it's like a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a branch: cyclohexyl and a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, no, wait—the formula is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh, wait, the numbering might be such that the aldehyde is on the same carbon as the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (position 1) has three substituents: a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and an aldehyde group (CHO). Wait, that can't be right because a carbon can't have three substituents plus be part of the ring. Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons (position 1) is attached to a group that's cyclohexyl, and a hydroxymethyl group. And that same position also has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the cyclohexane is attached to a chain that has both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl groups. Or maybe it's that the cyclohexane has a substituent, which is a CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, perhaps 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde means that the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group that's attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl. And that same CH2 is connected to a carbonyl group (the aldehyde). So the structure would be cyclohexane with a substituent like CH2(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl and also a CHO group. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's that the substituent is a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexane, but that's getting me more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a carbon that's also attached to a hydroxymethyl group and the aldehyde group. So, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is connected to a CH2 group, which has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent. And that same CH2 has a formyl (CHO) group. Wait, that might not be possible because a carbon can only have four bonds. So, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group. That would require the CH2 to have four bonds: cyclohexane ring, cyclohexyl, OH, and CHO. But that's four bonds, which would make it a quaternary carbon. I'm not sure if that's correct, but perhaps that's the structure.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's think: the main ring is cyclohexane. One carbon in the ring has a substituent which is a CH2 group. That CH2 is attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a formyl group. So, the substituent is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)(CHO). But wait, that's four bonds. Oh, that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So maybe I got the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH group attached to the ring, which has a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde. Wait, that's three substituents plus the ring—so four bonds. So that would make the substituent a CH group, but that's a secondary carbon. Hmm, maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the ring, which is then connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And the same CH2 is attached to an aldehyde. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. But wait, that's four substituents on the CH2, which isn't possible because CH2 can only have two substituents (like two bonds from the CH2 group). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps I should focus on the reaction steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, ethynyl is a triple bond between two carbons. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no. Wait, ethynyl is a vinyl group with triple bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane attached to an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or perhaps cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-C≡CH? No, ethynyl is just -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane attached to a triple bond. So, cyclohexane with a substituent CH2-C≡CH? Or wait, ethynyl is the group -C≡C-CH2-? No, wait, ethynyl is a carbon-carbon triple bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a substituent that's a triple bond, like CH2-C≡CH attached to the ring? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached to one of its carbons. So, cyclohexane has a substituent -C≡CH, making it cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or maybe cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-C≡CH? No, ethynyl is just the group -C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane attached to a -C≡CH group. So, the molecule would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, but ethynyl is a substituent where the triple bond starts at the ring. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, the ethynyl group is CH2-C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH substituent. So, the structure is cyclohexane attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a C≡CH.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is cyclohexane with a triple bond, so it's like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, the starting molecule is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group.

Now, the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the starting material undergoes some reactions to add groups and form the aldehyde.

Let me think about the possible reaction steps. The options involve several reagents, including NaNH2, H2/Pd, Li/NH3, O3, HgSO4, etc.

Looking at the options, they all start with NaNH2 and something else. For example, option C starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Option D starts with NaNH2 and methanol. So, maybe the first step is a deprotonation or some kind of substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 (sodium amide) is a strong base, often used for deprotonating compounds. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, perhaps the first step is deprotonating a compound and then methylating. But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, maybe the first step is adding a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form an alkyne. Wait, but the starting material already has an alkyne group (ethynyl). Hmm, maybe the first step is using a strong base like NaNH2 to deprotonate something. But where?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a sp-hybridized carbon. Deprotonating may not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the first step is adding a methyl group using methyl chloride as an alkylating agent. But how?

Wait, perhaps the first step is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Birch reduction. Wait, NaNH2 is used in some reductions, but not Birch. Birch uses Li/NH3. So, maybe option B has Li/NH3 as the second step.

Wait, let me think about the possible transformations needed.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group to another ring. Perhaps the starting material undergoes some kind of cyclopropanation or cycloaddition, but that's probably not here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is functionalized. For example, adding groups to the triple bond.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane's triple bond could be used in a series of reactions. One common approach is to add a hydroxyl group via hydration. But the target has an aldehyde group, which suggests oxidation.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (step 1) → Intermediate 1
2. Intermediate 1 → (step 2) → Intermediate 2
3. Intermediate 2 → (step 3) → Intermediate 3
4. Intermediate 3 → (step 4) → Target compound

So, what functional groups are in the target? There's an aldehyde (CHO), a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is part of the main ring. Maybe the starting material's triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then further modified.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone. Then, perhaps some kind of alkylation occurs, followed by oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about each step.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Step 1 in option C is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, maybe methylating the alkyne. But how? NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate the alkyne. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So perhaps deprotonation of the alkyne's terminal hydrogen, followed by alkylation to form a gem-dimethyl group.

Wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating with NaNH2 (a strong base) would give the acetylide ion. Then, reacting with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. So, CH2-C≡CH → (NaNH2) → CH2-C≡C⁻ → (CH3Cl) → CH2-C(CH3)≡C⁻? Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the alkyne is deprotonated to form the acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to form CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, that would be a substitution on the alkyne. So, the triple bond would become a single bond with two methyl groups? Or maybe it's adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is an alkylation of the cyclohexane. But the starting material doesn't have a leaving group on the cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: the first step is a deprotonation of the alkyne to form the acetylide, which is then quenched with methyl chloride. So, perhaps the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-Me. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group adds to the acetylide, giving a gem-dimethyl group. So, the triple bond would become CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide is treated with methyl chloride, leading to substitution at the alkyne position. So, the triple bond (CH2-C≡CH) becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. But that would be 1-propyne, which doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form the acetylide, which is then treated with another compound. But perhaps the first step isn’t about the alkyne but about the ring. But the ring is cyclohexane, which is quite stable and doesn't easily deprotonate under such conditions.

Wait, maybe the first step is using NaNH2 as a base to deprotonate a more acidic hydrogen elsewhere. But in ethynylcyclohexane, the only acidic protons would be on the alkyne. The alkyne's terminal hydrogen is somewhat acidic, with a pKa around 25. Sodium amide has a strong enough base to deprotonate it (since NaNH2 has a very strong base, NH2⁻, which can deprotonate things with pKa up to around 40 or so).

So, step 1 in option C is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride (an alkylating agent) would react with the acetylide. So, the reaction would be:

CH2-C≡CH → (NaNH2) → CH2-C≡C⁻Na⁺ 
Then, CH3Cl would react: CH2-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH3Cl → CH2-C(CH3)≡C⁻ + NaCl.

Wait, but that would give CH2-C(CH3)≡C⁻, which would then protonate to CH2-C(CH3)≡CH. But that's a gem-dichloride? No, no, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no, the acetylide is CH2-C≡C⁻, and when it reacts with methyl chloride (R-X), it would substitute the X, giving CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, the triple bond would now be between two CH2 groups? No, wait, the starting material is CH2-C≡CH. Adding a methyl group to the triple bond via alkylation would give CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, the molecule would be CH2-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-propyne, but attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But I don't think that's the right direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group to the alkyne via a different mechanism. But perhaps I'm getting stuck here and should think about the overall goal.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests that the starting alkyne (sp-hybridized) needs to be oxidized to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps in one of the steps, the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

Another common approach is the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. But that's usually done with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (like in the oxymercuration of alkynes, but for alkenes, it's mercury-based). Alternatively, the alkyne can be converted to a diketone via ozonolysis, but that's for alkenes, not alkynes. Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes; for alkynes, it can lead to different products.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think about the steps. So, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, which can then undergo further reactions, like oxidation or alkylation.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond, so perhaps the triple bond is used to introduce a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation of the alkyne, followed by hydrogenation, then ozonolysis, etc.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl and aldehyde group. Maybe the aldehyde comes from an oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps a secondary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a hydroxyl group to the alkyne position.
2. Oxidize that to a carbonyl group.
3. Maybe introduce another substituent.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options:

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

So, steps 1: deprotonate alkyne to form acetylide, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group. So, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's 1-propyne. Then step 2 is H2 with Pd catalyst. That would hydrogenate the triple bond. So, H2/Pd would add hydrogen across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically add two Hs to each carbon, converting triple to single. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that structure doesn't make sense because it would be a single bond. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the triple bond is between the two CH2 groups. So, after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the molecule becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's a four-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is usually for breaking double bonds. But if the molecule after step 2 is a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do much. Unless I'm misunderstanding the step.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrogenation step. Maybe the hydrogenation is partial, but usually, H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis of a double bond. But if the triple bond was hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond. So, maybe that's not the right approach.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li, liquid NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe deprotonating and then quenching with methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but perhaps it's an acidic workup. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, which uses Li and NH3. So, after step 1, maybe we have an acetylide, and then step 2 is Birch reduction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then step 2 is using Li and liquid NH3 (Birch conditions) to reduce the triple bond. Birch reduction typically reduces aromatic rings, but maybe it can also reduce triple bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol or something else.

Another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)(CHO) group. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The first step converts the triple bond into a carbonyl group. How? One method is via Oxymercuration, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, treatment with HgSO4 and H2SO4 can oxidize the alkyne to a ketone.

Wait, but alkyne oxidation can lead to a diketone. For example, ozonolysis of an alkyne gives diketones, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is treated with a strong oxidizing agent to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. But I'm not sure about the conditions. Maybe via acid-catalyzed hydration, which would produce a ketone. For example, H2SO4 and HgSO4 is a catalyst for hydration of alkynes to ketones.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane is treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (hydration catalyst), which would convert the triple bond into a ketone. So, the product would be cyclohexane with a ketone group, perhaps cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Or maybe cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. Wait, no, the product of hydration of an alkyne is a ketone. So, the triple bond (CH2-C≡CH) would become CH2-C(OH)–CH2–, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. Upon hydration, it would become CH2-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? No, wait, that's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be RCHO. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting it right.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is at the end. So, CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Upon hydration, the triple bond becomes a ketone, so it would be CH2-C(O)-CH3. So, the molecule would be cyclohexane with a substituent CH2-C(O)-CH3, which is a ketone. So, now it's cyclohexanecarbonylpropane or something.

But how does that lead to the target, which has an aldehyde group?

Wait, perhaps after forming the ketone, it needs to be oxidized further. But ketones are generally resistant to oxidation. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But that would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted into a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. That would require removing a carbon, which might not be feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about each option in turn and see which sequence makes sense.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, step 3 is written twice. Probably a typo. So, steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride.
2. Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd.
3. Ba(OH)2.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

But I'm not sure how these steps would lead to the target.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li, liquid NH3
3. O3, H2O
4. NH4OH

So, steps 1 and 2 involve deprotonation and maybe alkylation, then Li and NH3 (Birch conditions), which usually is for ring-opening of aromatic compounds. But the starting material isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

So, step 3 is ozonolysis, which is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. But after step 2, which is hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so no double bonds. So, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Unless perhaps in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation typically adds H2 across triple bonds, turning them into single bonds. Partial hydrogenation (like with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst) gives cis double bonds. But Pd usually fully hydrogenates. So, after step 2, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so no double bond exists, making ozonolysis ineffective.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li, liquid NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe deprotonating the alkyne, then quenching with methanol, which would methylate the acetylide. So, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol to form CH2-C≡C-CH2-OH. Wait, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne, forming an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol in a substitution reaction. So, the acetylide attacks the methyl group from methanol, giving CH2-C≡C-CH2-OH. But I'm not sure about that. Then step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is Birch conditions. But the starting material after step 1 is a non-aromatic alkyne, so I'm not sure what Birch would do.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction of the alkyne. Wait, but Li and NH3 are used for Birch reduction, which isn't typically used for alkynes but for aromatic rings.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Alternative approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group all attached to the same carbon on the cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a hydroxyl group to the ethynyl group.
2. Converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone).
3. Modifying the structure to add the cyclohexyl group and hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Wait, another thought. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the starting material's triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group (like a ketone), then a Grignard reagent is added to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I don't see Grignard reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then some kind of addition reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group. For that, perhaps using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water (hydration). So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, but hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone. Unless the alkyne is terminal, like HC≡C-R. Then, hydration would give R-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone. But in our case, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, hydration would give CH2-C(OH)-CH3, which would be a ketone attached to cyclohexane. So, the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a substituent CH2-C(O)CH3, which is a ketone.

But the target has an aldehyde group, not a ketone. So perhaps after forming the ketone, it's reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. Wait, but secondary alcohols oxidize to ketones, not aldehydes. So that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted into a primary alcohol, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde. But that would require breaking a carbon-carbon bond, which is unlikely under normal conditions.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, perhaps the substituent on the cyclohexane is a CH2 group that has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group, and the same carbon has an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde. But that would require the substituent to have three bonds, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and the same CH2 is attached to an aldehyde group. But that would make the substituent CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl)(CHO), which is four bonds, which isn't possible. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH group attached to three groups: a hydroxyl, a cyclohexyl, and an aldehyde. But again, that's four bonds. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which also has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group. So, the structure is cyclohexane attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group. But that's four bonds on the CH2, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is a CH group attached to a cyclohexane, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group, and that CH is attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is a CH group attached to three groups: cyclohexane (ring), cyclohexyl, OH, and CHO. That would require the CH group to have four substituents, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group. The CH2 is attached to the ring, a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group. But that would make the CH2 have four substituents, which is again impossible.

I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reagents and see which option makes sense.

Option C, for example, includes ozonolysis (O3) and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. But after step 2 in option C, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, so no double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, maybe option C isn't the right sequence.

Option B includes O3 and H2O. So, if a double bond is present after step 2, ozonolysis would cleave it. But step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is Birch conditions. Birch reduces aromatic rings to dienes. So, if the starting material after step 1 is a benzene ring with substituents, but our starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which isn't aromatic. So, perhaps Birch isn't applicable here.

Option D includes O3. So, if after step 2, a double bond is present, then O3 would cleave it. So, what would step 2 be? Step 2 in D is Li and liquid NH3. So, perhaps step 1 is forming an acetylide, step 2 is Birch-like conditions to form a diene, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to map each option.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (geminal dimethyl)
2. H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
3. Ozonolysis → since there's no double bond, maybe this step doesn't do anything. So, perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → acetylide forms, then reacts with methanol. Quenching with methanol would give CH2-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol to form CH2-C≡C-CH2-OH. Not sure.

2. Li and liquid NH3 → Birch reduction, but the molecule after step 1 isn't aromatic. So, maybe Li and NH3 would deprotonate something else. Or perhaps it's used for deprotonation of the alkyne again, but I'm not certain.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves any double bonds. So, if step 2 created a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps.

But I'm not seeing a clear path here.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 (ethyl group added)
2. Li and NH3 → Birch conditions, but the molecule isn't aromatic. Maybe this step doesn't do anything useful.
3. O3/ H2O → cleaves double bonds, but if no double bond, nothing happens.
4. NH4OH → workup.

Not seeing it.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3
2. H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe a strong base for elimination, but the structure after step 2 is a straight chain, so elimination would form a double bond.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration catalyst. If there's a double bond, it would hydrate to a diol or a ketone.

Wait, maybe after step 3, a double bond is formed. Let's think:

After step 2, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a four-carbon chain). Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it causes elimination, removing a water and forming a double bond. So, the four-carbon chain would lose a water molecule, forming a double bond. But where? The chain is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. To form a double bond, perhaps between the second and third carbons, giving CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, after step 2, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. If step 3 is Ba(OH)2, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination. But in that case, we need a quaternary ammonium salt, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause an E2 elimination, removing H2O and forming a double bond. But for that, we need a β-hydrogen. The structure after step 2 is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, any elimination would require adjacent Hs. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, then eliminating H2O would require removing H from CH2 and OH from adjacent, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is hydration of a triple bond, but step 2 has already hydrogenated it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's think of another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached. So, perhaps the starting material undergoes a ring expansion or some cycloaddition to form the cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, another approach: The target is a cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH group attached to a cyclohexyl, OH, and CHO. So, perhaps the substituent is formed by adding groups to the starting alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then the carbonyl is subjected to some kind of addition reaction. For example, after forming a ketone, adding a Grignard reagent to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized.

But the options don't include Grignard reagents. So, perhaps it's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a few steps. Let's think about the reagents.

If we have ethynylcyclohexane and want to make a aldehyde, perhaps the triple bond is first converted to a carbonyl group, then reduced to an aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the alkyne can be converted to a carbonyl via oxidation. For example, using O3 (ozone) followed by reductive workup. Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives diketones, but I'm not certain.

Wait, ozonolysis of an alkyne would give something like O=C-R-C=O. So, perhaps if the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH, ozonolysis would give two ketone groups: CH3-C(=O)-O and O-C(=O)-CH3, but that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups. But in that case, the product would be two carbonyls. But the target has a single aldehyde.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct answer by elimination.

Looking again at the reagents:

In the target, we have an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. To form an aldehyde, the alcohol must be primary.

Which of the options includes steps that would form a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to aldehyde?

Looking at option C:

Step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination. Alternatively, it can be used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, but I'm not sure.

Option D, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild acid for workup after ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Convert the alkyne to a carbonyl group.
2. Reduce the carbonyl to a primary alcohol.
3. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.
But I don't see an oxidation step in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via another method.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the CH2 group is part of a Grignard addition. But the options don't include Grignard reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a geminal diol, then treated to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 to form acetylide.
2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-CH3.
3. Hydrogenation → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
4. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so nothing happens. So, option C is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenation to a single bond, and then ozonolysis isn't used. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on process of elimination.

The target has an aldehyde group, which suggests oxidation. Which options include an oxidation step? Let's see:

Option A: step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → this is a typical condition for hydrating a carbonyl, but if the triple bond is hydrogenated, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydration.

Option C: step 3 is ozonolysis, which might form carbonyl groups if there's a double bond.

Wait, but after step 2 in option C, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond. So, no double bond. So ozonolysis in step 3 would do nothing.

Option D: step 3 is ozonolysis. So, perhaps the molecule after step 2 has a double bond.

Wait, what would step 2 in option D do? Step 2 is Li and liquid NH3 (Birch conditions). Birch is used to reduce aromatic rings to dienes, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which isn't aromatic. So, maybe step 2 doesn't do anything. Unless the alkyne is somehow converted into an aromatic ring, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. Wait, but H2 and Pd usually hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, not cis alkenes.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that H2 with a different catalyst (like Lindlar's) would hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. But option C uses H2/Pd, which would fully hydrogenate to a single bond.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the target and which reagent would form the aldehyde.

Looking again at the target: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which also has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the ring, which has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group. So, that would require the CH2 group to have three substituents, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the structure is (cyclohexyl)(CH2OH)(CHO) attached to the cyclohexane. But that's four bonds, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is further attached to a CHO group. So, perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)(CHO)CH(OH)-cyclohexane. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH group attached to the ring, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group. But that would require four bonds, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH2 group, which has a cyclohexyl group attached, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group attached to the same carbon. But that's four bonds, so impossible. So, perhaps the structure is such that the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH group, which also has a hydroxyl and aldehyde group.

I'm really stuck on the structure. Maybe I should instead think about the reagents and the possible transformations.

The correct answer probably involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group, then adding substituents. So, perhaps the first step is hydration of the alkyne to a ketone, then some alkylation to add a hydroxymethyl group, followed by oxidation of the ketone to aldehyde.

Wait, but the options don't include HgSO4 and H2SO4 in the first step. Option A's step 4 is H2SO4 and HgSO4. So, perhaps step 4 is the hydration of a triple bond to a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → triple bond becomes single bond, CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ba(OH)2 → elimination to form a double bond.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of the triple bond to a carbonyl? But the triple bond is already hydrogenated.

No, after step 2, it's a single bond, so step 4 wouldn't hydrate anything.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is eliminating to form a double bond, and step 4 hydrates that double bond to a carbonyl.

Wait, that could make sense. Let's outline:

Option A:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-CH3 (gem-dimethyl).
2. H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
3. Ba(OH)2 → elimination reaction, removing H2O and forming a double bond. So, CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, the structure after step 2 is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the ring. To eliminate, we'd need adjacent Hs. Maybe it forms CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 attached to the ring.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydrate the double bond to a diol or a ketone. For a double bond in CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, hydration would typically give a secondary alcohol, like CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a secondary alcohol, which doesn't oxidize to an aldehyde.

So, that doesn't lead to an aldehyde.

Hmm, this is getting too time-consuming. I think the correct answer is option C. Let me see why.

Option C's steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → NaNH2 and methyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → reduces to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
3. Ozonolysis → But no double bonds, so no cleavage. So, this step would do nothing.
4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps eliminates to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 2 in option C. Maybe step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond. Some catalysts, like Lindlar's, hydrogenate alkynes to cis alkenes. But Pd usually fully hydrogenates.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option C is a partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene, which then undergoes ozonolysis in step 3. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, if step 2 in option C is H2/Pd, which fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, then ozonolysis wouldn't find any double bonds. So, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps option C has a typo, and the hydrogenation uses Lindlar's catalyst, which would give a cis double bond. But the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is usually for full hydrogenation.

Hmm.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. The correct sequence likely involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group, then adding substituents. The steps that include hydration (like HgSO4 and H2SO4) would form the carbonyl. Looking back, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration conditions. So, if the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and then a hydroxymethyl group is added via some kind of addition reaction, like hydroboration or something else. But the options don't have those reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a reduction to form a secondary alcohol, followed by oxidation to an aldehyde. But oxidation of secondary alcohols doesn't form aldehydes.

I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and an aldehyde group (CHO) attached to the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This likely forms a gem-dimethyl group by deprotonating the alkyne and alkylating it.
2. **H2/Pd**: Full hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a saturated chain.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base that could induce elimination, potentially forming a double bond.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Hydration conditions that could convert a double bond into a carbonyl group.

However, after step 2, the triple bond is fully hydrogenated to a single bond, leaving no double bond for ozonolysis in step 3. Step 4 would not effectively form the desired aldehyde group.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: This would likely form a gem-diethyl group by deprotonating the alkyne and alkylating it.
2. **Li, liquid NH3**: Birch reduction conditions, typically used for aromatic systems, but the starting material is not aromatic.
3. **O3, H2O**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild acid for workup, but this step does not contribute to forming the target structure.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it, forming a gem-dimethyl group.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Full hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a saturated chain.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but no double bond is present after step 2, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base that could induce elimination, but this step does not align with forming the target structure.

This sequence does not successfully produce the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and quenches it with methanol, potentially forming a hydroxymethyl group.
2. **Li, liquid NH3**: Birch reduction conditions, but the starting material is not aromatic, making this step unclear.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild acid for workup, but this step does not contribute to forming the target structure.

This sequence also does not lead to the desired product.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences explicitly and correctly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the most plausible choice, as it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary functional groups, even though some steps are not fully aligned with the target structure.

Answer: C
