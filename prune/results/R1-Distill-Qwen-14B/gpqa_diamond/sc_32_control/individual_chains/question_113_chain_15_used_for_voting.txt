Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the problem says that the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, it's a very broad peak, which makes me think of something with hydrogen bonding, maybe a hydroxyl group. But there are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Oh, those are likely carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a ketone or aldehyde, but wait, no, wait—wait, 1700 could also be an ester or a carbonyl. The 1650 is lower, so maybe conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond, probably in a conjugated system maybe.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. I remember that the molecular ion at 45 could correspond to something like (CH3)2O (which is 46, wait no, that's 46). Alternatively, maybe a ketene? Or perhaps a fragment from a larger molecule breaking into a smaller one. Wait, 45 is the mass of (CH2O), which is formaldehyde, but that doesn't make much sense here. Or maybe it's a different fragment. Let's think: 45 is equal to the molecular weight of CH3CO (which is 43, no). Oh wait, 45 is (CH3)2O is 46. Maybe it's the loss of something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the fragment from a ketone. Or maybe a CO group? Hmm, not sure yet.

Now, looking at the molecular formulas provided: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the possible functional groups and structures vary.

Let me think about the IR first. A broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H. So the compound has either an alcohol group or maybe a carboxylic acid. But in carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is very strong and broad, around 2500-3300, which fits. But the presence of both 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 could indicate conjugated carbonyl groups. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but the 1650 might be something else. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an α,β-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups, like in a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, but let's think of possible structures. If it's a benzene ring, then the 1650 could be the C=C stretching in the ring. Because aromatic C=C stretches are usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. 1650 is a bit higher—that could be where a conjugated carbonyl is. So maybe it's an aromatic ester or ketone.

But let's also think about the NMR. There are vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the molecule has a double bond. Let's imagine a structure with a benzene ring and a conjugated carbonyl group, like an aromatic ester. For example, methyl benzoate has a carbonyl at around 1700, and the aromatic protons would be deshielded. But wait, methyl benzoate's molecular formula is C8H8O2. But our options have C6H... So perhaps a smaller molecule. Wait, maybe it's something like a benzaldehyde derivative? No, because benzaldehyde would have a carbonyl at around 1700 and no O-H.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak, which suggests an O-H group. So maybe it's a phenol? But phenol's O-H is broad and strong, around 3000-3500. But phenol has a C6H5OH structure. The molecular formula would be C6H6O. But none of the options fit that. Hmm.

Alternative approach: let's consider the possible formulas and their possible structures.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

We have to choose between these four.

Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

For each formula:

A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1.

So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond.

B) C6H10O: DoU = (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So two DoU—could be two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

C) C6H10O2: DoU = (14 -10)/2 =2. So two DoU.

D) C6H12O: DoU= (14-12)/2=1.

So, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies at least one double bond or a ring with unsaturation. So looking at the options, B and C have two DoU each, so possibly a ring plus a double bond, or two rings.

The IR shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, likely. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with C=C.

If the compound has a carbonyl and a ring, maybe it's an aromatic ester or ketone.

If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the ester group would also have an O-H (if a carboxylic acid was part of it, but no, esters are O-H free. Wait, wait, if it's an ester, then the IR wouldn't have a broad O-H peak. Oh, but the IR does have that. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid has the O-H and a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait. Another structure with O-H is an alcohol. But the IR has a broad peak, which could be from an alcohol. But then where is the carbonyl?

Hmm. Let me think again. Let's consider each option and what the data might imply.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So maybe a ring or a double bond. If it's a six-membered ring with an ester group. But with O-H? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone) but that would have a carbonyl but no O-H. So perhaps it's a diol? No, but that might not fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe an ester and a ring. Wait, if it's a six-membered ring with an ester group, but then where is the O-H? Maybe it's a di-substituted ester with an O-H elsewhere. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is 2. So maybe a benzene ring (which has 3 DoU—each ring is 1 DoU, each double bond is 1). Wait, benzene is 3 DoU. But this compound has DoU of 2. So maybe a five-membered ring with a double bond, or a six-membered ring with a double bond.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopentane with a double bond. But if it's an alcohol, then O-H would be present, which could explain the IR. But where would the 1700 and 1650 peaks come from? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol. So a molecule with both a ketone and an alcoholic O-H. But would that fit the NMR? The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So maybe a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group. Because benzene (3 DoU) plus a carbonyl (another DoU) would sum to 4, but the DoU is 2—so that can't be. Wait, maybe a cyclohexene ring (1 DoU from ring, 1 from double bond, totaling 2) and an ester group. But wait, O2 in the formula would imply two oxygen atoms. For example, something like cyclohexene with an ester substituent. Alternatively, maybe a cyclohexanol with a ketone group? But that would add up to more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a molecule with a conjugated carbonyl and an O-H group. Like a phenolic structure with a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think of it this way. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H (like an alcohol or phenol) and two carbonyl peaks.

Wait, two carbonyl peaks? 1700 and 1650. Hmm, that's unusual. Usually, a single carbonyl peak. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. So maybe a structure like cinnamaldehyde or something similar. But would that have an O-H group?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would require two ester groups, and the O count would be higher. Wait, the formula for option C is C6H10O2. So O2. So maybe two ester groups? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a ketone with an alcohol group. But then the IR would have a strong peak for the carbonyl and a broad O-H from the alcohol. But in the IR, there are two peaks—1700 and 1650. So perhaps another carbonyl group, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has an ester group (O2) and a ring. Let me think: for example, methyl cyclohexanoate. The ester group would give the 1700 peak. But where does the 1650 come from? Maybe conjugation with a double bond. Wait, if the cyclohexane has a double bond, then it's cyclohexene, and the ester carbonyl would be at 1700, but maybe the conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650. But would that show as a vinyl hydrogen in the NMR? Yes, because the double bond would have protons.

So, the structure could be something like methyl cyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylate? Wait, but that would have a higher molecular formula. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

Wait, but what about the molecular formula? Let's calculate the molecular weight for each option.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45 is interesting. Let me think about possible fragments.

45 is the molecular ion for something like CH3COOH (46?), no. Wait, 45 is (CH2O), which is formaldehyde (HCHO). But that's 30. Wait, wait, molecular weight of HCHO is 30 (H=1, C=12, O=16: 1+12+16=30+1=31? No, wait, HCHO has formula CH2O, which is 30. So m/z 30 would be that. But the fragment is at 45. So 45 could be something else.

Wait, 45 could be a ketene ion (CH2CO+, which is 45: 12+2 +12 +16=45+?) Wait, 12 (C) + 2*(H) + 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 42? No, wait, no. Wait, wait.

Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone) but that has a molecular weight of 58 (CH3)2CO: 2*(12+3) +12 +16= 2*15 +28= 30+28=58. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a fragment from a larger molecule. For example, if the molecule breaks into a smaller part with a molecular weight of 45. Let's think about possible groups that would have a fragment of 45.

Another approach: the molecular formula has to fit with the possible structure. Let's go back to the options.

Option C is C6H10O2. So the degrees of unsaturation are 2. If there's a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), that doesn't fit. So perhaps it's a cyclopropane or another structure. Wait, maybe a double bond and a ring. For example, a cyclopentene ring (double bond and ring, DoU=2). But then where are the oxygen atoms? The formula has two O's. So maybe an ester group attached to a cyclopentene ring. Let's imagine something like cyclopentene with an ester substituent.

Wait, but let me think about the possible structures. Another possibility is a diol with a carbonyl group, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, the compound could have an ester group and an alcohol group. So, for example, a compound with a structure like an ester functional group and an alcoholic hydroxyl group. But that would have O2, which matches option C.

Wait, but if the compound has both an ester (O2) and an alcohol (O1), that would sum to O3, but the formula has O2. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe it's a hemiacetal or something similar, but that seems complicated.

Let me think about the mass spectrum again. The fragment at m/z 45. Another possibility is that it's a butyraldehyde fragment or something. Wait, but butyraldehyde is C4H8O, which has a molecular weight of 72 (12*4 +8 +16=48+8+16=72). So a fragment of 45 would be part of that.

Alternatively, 45 could be a cleavage product that includes a carbonyl group. For example, maybe the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, leading to a fragment with the carbonyl and some hydrocarbons. So perhaps the fragment is something like (CH2)2CO, which is 45 (assuming (CH2)2CO: 12*3 + 2*5 +16= 36+10+16=62? No, wait, (CH2)2CO is CH2CH2CO, which is C3H4O. Molecular weight would be 3*12 +4*1 +16=36 +4 +16=56. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion peak at 45 could correspond to (CH3)CO+ (which is 45: 12 + 3*1 + 12 +16 = 43? Wait, 12 (C) +3 (CH3) + another C (12) + O (16) = 43. No, 12+3=15; 15+12=27; 27+16=43. So that's 43, not 45. So perhaps a different fragment.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone fragment. For example, the structure might break to form a ketone group. So, a fragment with a carbonyl group and some hydrogens.

Alternatively, if the compound is a diester, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Another angle: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So there is a double bond with hydrogens attached. So the structure has a CH2=CH group, perhaps.

Let me think of a possible structure that fits all the data.

IR: O-H (broad), two carbonyls at 1700 and 1650.

NMR: vinyl hydrogens.

Mass: m/z 45.

So, perhaps it's an ester with a vinyl group. Let's consider something like methyl vinyl benzoate? Wait, but that's more than C6.

Alternatively, perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For example, a compound like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a simple ester with a double bond. Like methyl propenoate. But that would have a formula of C4H6O2. Hmm, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, another approach: molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72 +12 +32=116.

B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10*1)+16=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. So if the molecular weight is, say, 114, the fragment at 45 would be about 40% of the molecular weight. That's possible. For example, in a molecule that breaks into a smaller fragment and the rest.

So, for option C, the molecular weight is 114. If a fragment of 45 is present, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts: 45 and the rest (69). Hmm.

Alternatively, the molecular weight of the unknown is higher than the options given? No, the options are the only possibilities.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2, which could be something like methyl cyclohex-2-enoate. Let's calculate that: the formula is C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12=72, 10 H is 10, 2 O is 32. Total 114. The molecular ion (M) would be at 114. So the fragments would be part of that.

If the molecule breaks to form a fragment with 45, that's about 45/114 ~ 40% of the molecular weight. So perhaps the molecule undergoes a cleavage that produces a 45 m/z fragment.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a more stable radical, like a ketene fragment.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. Two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Could that be an ester (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650), or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which can have two absorption peaks.

If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like something with a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl, then the carbonyl may appear around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650. But wait, in such cases, the carbonyl is typically around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might have a lower wavenumber, perhaps around 1650. So that fits.

So, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an O-H group. But wait, where would the O-H come from? Because the ester itself doesn't have an O-H group. Oh wait, but if it's a diol ester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a different functional group, like an alcohol, but the ester would have the carbonyl at 1700.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an O-H, so maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. But then, the ester would not be present—wait, a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, which matches. But then, the 1650 peak—if it's a conjugated system, perhaps an aromatic ring, but the options don't have enough carbon atoms for an aromatic ring. Wait, the formula is C6H10O2. So, if it's a six-carbon compound, perhaps with a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require O2, which matches option C.

But wait, a six-membered ring with a ketone and an alcohol group. But that would give two carbonyl peaks? I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. But that would have O in the ring, but I'm not sure about the O count. A lactone would have an ester group (O), but the structure would have an oxygen in the ring. Wait, a lactone's formula would have O2, which matches option C.

If the compound is a lactone, then the IR would show a carbonyl around 1700. But where would the 1650 peak come from? Lactones don't typically have peaks at 1650 unless there's some conjugation.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an ester and a conjugated double bond. For example, a molecule with an ester group and a double bond, leading to two peaks in IR.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try another angle: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule must have a double bond where the protons are attached. So maybe the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that would be methyl acrylate, which has the formula C4H6O2. That doesn't match our options. So perhaps a larger molecule.

Wait, the options are all C6. So perhaps the molecule is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a six-carbon chain. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. But that's seven carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring structure with a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. So, for example, the ester is attached to one of the carbons in the ring, and the ring has a double bond (so it's a cyclohexene). The ester would give the 1700 peak, and the conjugated double bond (maybe the ring) could give the 1650 peak.

In that case, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Because cyclohexene is C6H10, and adding an ester group (like O and another O from the ester) would make it C6H10O2. So option C.

But wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding an ester group (O2) would make it C6H10O2. So yes, that fits option C.

So the structure would be something like cyclohexene with an ester substituent. For example, perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached, like cyclohex-2-enyl acetate or something similar. But the specific substituent isn't as important as the functionality.

Now, the NMR would show vinyl protons, which are the protons on the double bond. So that fits.

The IR would show the ester carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond (the cyclohexene's double bond) might show a peak around 1650. That makes sense.

The O-H peak in IR is confusing. Wait, in this structure, I don't see an O-H group. So why is there a broad peak at 3000? Hmm, that's a problem. Because in the structure I'm thinking of (cyclohexene with an ester), there's no O-H. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. So let's go back. The IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an O-H group. So the compound must have an O-H group. Thus, the structure must include that. So perhaps it's a diol ester, but that would have more O's. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. For example, something like CH2OHCH2COOCH2CH3. But that's a bit made-up.

Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a broad peak, which could be from a carbonyl group if it's an amide, but the options don't have N, so it's not that. So O-H is more likely.

If the compound has both an ester (O2) and an O-H group, that would require O3, which isn't present in any of the options except perhaps none. Wait, no, because the options have up to O2.

So maybe the structure has a ketone and an O-H. So option A is C6H12O2. That would have two O's. So perhaps a structure with a ketone and an O-H group.

But then, the IR would show the O-H as a broad peak (alcohol) and the ketone at 1700. But why is there a peak at 1650? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with an O-H group. But then the aromatic ring would have a C=C peak around 1650.

Wait, but earlier the DoU for option C is 2, which doesn't fit a benzene ring (which has 3 DoU). So perhaps it's a conjugated diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with a substituent that has an O-H group. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, another angle: the O-H in IR could be from a phenol group. Then, the compound would have a benzene ring. But for benzene, the DoU is 3 (three double bonds in the ring). So for the options, let's see:

Option C: DoU 2. So benzene (3 DoU) plus another one (from a carbonyl) would sum to 4, but the DoU is 2, so that can't fit.

So that's not possible. So the O-H isn't from a phenol group.

Therefore, the O-H must be from an alcohol group. So the compound has an alcohol (O-H) and a carbonyl group (probably ester or ketone). But then why two carbonyl peaks?

Wait, maybe the molecule has two different carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone. But that would require more oxygen atoms. Let's consider the formula.

If the formula has two carbonyl groups (like ester and ketone), then O would be in the formula accordingly. For example, O3. But our options don't have O3. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the mass spectrum again.

The fragment at m/z 45. Let me calculate the possible formulas that could give 45.

Possible fragments could be:

- CH3COOH: molecular weight is 60. No, but m/z 45 is lower.

Wait, another possible fragment is the CH3CO+ ion, which has a mass of 43 (12+2*1 +12 +16=43). Not 45.

Wait, 45 would be the mass of C3H7O. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. For example, the fragment could be COCH2CH2..., but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is C3H5O2. Let me calculate: 3*12 +5 +32=36+5+32=73. No, that's too big.

Hmm. Another possibility: the fragment is CH2CH2CO+. That would be 45? Let me compute: CH2CH2CO is CH2CH2CO, which is C3H4O. Molecular weight is 3*12 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. Still not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a different approach. The molecular formula of the unknown is one of the four options. So perhaps the molecular ion (M) is at a certain mass, and the fragment at 45 is a part of it.

For example, take option C: molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight 114. If the molecule breaks into two parts, one with 45 and the other with 69 (since 45+69=114), that could explain the fragment.

Hmm. What would 69 correspond to? 69 is the molecular weight of, say, something like C4H8O (if C4H8O is 64, no), or C3H12O (unlikely). Alternatively, 69 is the molecular weight of something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone, like (CH3)2CO, which is 58, but that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule loses a larger fragment, leaving behind a smaller one.

Wait, another thought: in mass spectrometry, the base peak is often a fragment that is stable, like a tertiary carbocation or something. So the fragment at 45 could be a stable carbocation. Let me think about possible structures.

45 could be (CH3)2CHCO, but that is 45? Let's calculate: (CH2)2CHCO is C4H7O+. Wait, molecular weight would be 4*12 +7 +16=48+7+16=71. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2O), which is formaldehyde, but that's 30.

Alternatively, maybe a CH2 group attached to something else. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, could the fragment be a tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, not 45.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

I'll make a table.

Option | Formula | DoU | Possible Functional Groups

A) C6H12O2: DoU=1. Could be a ring or a double bond. If a ring, maybe a six-membered ring with an ester group (O2). But where's the O-H? If it's an ester, no O-H. So perhaps a lactone (cyclic ester) which would have O2. Then, the IR would have a carbonyl at ~1700. But where's the O-H? Lactones don't have O-H unless they're open. Hmm.

B) C6H10O: DoU=2. Could be a ring plus a double bond. If it's a cyclohexene with an alcohol group. The IR would show O-H (alcohol) and a carbonyl? No, because this option only has O1. So no, that can't explain the 1700 peak.

C) C6H10O2: DoU=2. Could be a ring plus a double bond or two double bonds. Maybe a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. The ester would give the 1700 peak. But where's the O-H? Hmm. Unless it's a diol ester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but not sure.

D) C6H12O: DoU=1. Could be a ring or a double bond. If a ring, maybe a cyclohexanol. The IR would show O-H (alcohol) and no carbonyl (since this option only has O1). But the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, so this can't be.

So, from this analysis, the only option that includes an O-H group and some carbonyl groups is option C (C6H10O2), but I'm not entirely sure how the O-H comes into play here.

Wait, another thought—maybe the O-H is part of an acidic proton, like in a ketone's alpha proton. No, that's not an O-H.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol group, and the carbonyl is from an ester group. So the structure would have both an ester and an alcohol. But then the O count would be O3, which none of the options have. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a diester with an O-H group. But again, that would require more O's.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should go with the best fit.

The IR shows O-H (broad) and two carbonyls. The only way to have two carbonyls is if the molecule has two different carbonyl groups, but that would require more O's than available. Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are from the same carbonyl group in different environments, but I can't think of a scenario for that.

Alternatively, the 1650 peak is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring. But earlier analysis suggests that the DoU doesn't fit for a benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the 1650 peak is from a conjugated double bond, like an alkene. The 1700 peak is a carbonyl. So the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond. Plus an O-H.

So, thinking of a molecule with a conjugated diene and a carbonyl, along with an O-H. But the options don't have enough O's for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a hemiacetal or another structure where O is shared.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol substituent. That would require O2. For example, cyclohexanone with an adjacent OH group. But that would have the ketone carbonyl at 1700, and perhaps an O-H from the alcohol. But why the 1650 peak? The cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond, though. Wait, but if it's a cyclic ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone, then the DoU would be 2 (ring plus ketone). So the molecular formula would fit option C: C6H10O2.

In that structure, the IR would show the O-H (from the alcohol?) but wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O. So the formula would be C6H10O, which is option B. But option B only has O1, so that can't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the possible structures and their spectral data.

If the structure is an ester with a vinyl group, such as methyl vinyl acetate. But that's more than C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative, but that's not fitting.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an adjacent double bond. The lactone would have a carbonyl around 1700, and the double bond would show a peak around 1650. The O-H would be from the lactone ring opening, but no, lactones don't have O-H.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like cyclopentanone with an ester substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of an enol tautomer. But that's stretching it.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a broad O-H peak suggests that the compound is either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid. But the other IR peaks suggest the presence of two carbonyl groups.

But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H is very broad. The carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700. So where would the 1650 peak come from? Maybe a conjugated double bond.

So, for example, the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid. Let's say something like CH2=CHCOOH. The formula would be C3H4O2. But our options are C6, so perhaps a longer chain.

For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. That would be C6H10O2. The formula matches option C.

So, the structure would be an acrylic acid derivative, with a CH2=CH- group and a COOH group. The IR would show the O-H from the carboxylic acid (broad), the carbonyl from the acid at ~1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) at ~1650. The NMR would show the vinyl hydrogens from the CH2=CH- group. The mass spectrum would have a fragment at m/z 45, which could come from the CH2=CHCOOH breaking down.

What's the molecular formula of CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH? Let's calculate:

Each CH2 group is (CH2)n, COOH is (COOH). So:

CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH is C6H10O2. Yes, that matches option C.

So, the IR would show the O-H (carboxylic acid) as a broad peak, the carbonyl (COOH) around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (CH2=CH) at 1650. The NMR would have peaks for the vinyl protons (the CH2=CH group). The mass spectrum has a fragment at 45, perhaps from the loss of a part of the molecule.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data: FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the correct molecular formula from the given options: C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typical of a carbonyl group (C=O), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic C=C stretch.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (protons on a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a stable fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to a common fragment like CH₃CO⁺ (acetone ion) or a related structure.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This could correspond to a ring or a double bond but does not account for the observed O-H and two carbonyl peaks.
   - **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2. This could correspond to a ring plus a double bond or two double bonds but lacks sufficient oxygen to explain the two carbonyl peaks.
   - **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2. This could correspond to a conjugated system, such as a carbonyl group and a double bond. It also matches the molecular formula of a compound like CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂COOH (a substituted acrylic acid), which has an O-H group (carboxylic acid), a carbonyl group, and a conjugated double bond.
   - **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1. This could correspond to a ring or a double bond but does not account for the observed O-H and two carbonyl peaks.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have an O-H group (from the broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹), a carbonyl group (from the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak), and a conjugated double bond (from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak). The molecular formula C₆H₁₀O₂ (option C) fits all the spectral data, including the presence of a conjugated system (e.g., a substituted acrylic acid). The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 can also be explained by the proposed structure.
