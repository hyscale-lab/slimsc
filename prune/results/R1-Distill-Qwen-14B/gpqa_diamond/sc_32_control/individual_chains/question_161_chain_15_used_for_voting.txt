Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm... let me try to break this down.

Alright, so Mike is working on a high-res TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to remove as many gas molecules as possible to improve imaging because the electron beam shouldn't scatter too much off the remaining gas. But some gas particles are still there, and the mass spec detected them. 

Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as lambda1. The mean free path, I remember, is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Oh right, the formula for mean free path is lambda = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*pi*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So when the pressure is lower, the mean free path increases because molecules don't collide as often.

But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now lambda2, and it's different from lambda1. The temperature is the same, so T isn't the issue. Hmm, why would the mean free path change?

Wait, when the electron beam is on, electrons are moving through the chamber. The electrons would interact with the gas molecules. Could that affect the mean free path? I think the mean free path depends on the collisions between gas molecules themselves, right? Or does it also consider collisions with other objects, like the electron beam?

Wait, no. In the usual mean free path calculation, it's about collisions between gas molecules. But in this scenario, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are energetic. They can cause additional ionization or scattering of the gas molecules. Oh wait, but the gas molecules are neutral, right? So the electron beam would cause them to ionize if the electrons have enough energy. Or maybe the electrons are just scattering the gas molecules, causing them to move more, or altering their paths.

Wait, but the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. If the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize or to move, would that change the effective pressure? Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces some effect on the gas, like heating or dissociating molecules, but the problem says the temperature remained the same. So maybe not temperature.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be knocked out of the chamber or to be accelerated, which could affect the pressure. Or perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be ionized, leading to charged particles. Charged particles would behave differently because they might be attracted to the charged parts of the microscope or accelerate in the beam's electric fields. 

Wait, but in that case, the ionized gas molecules would have a different mean free path because they might be moving faster or in different directions. But if they become charged, they could get pulled into the walls of the chamber, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the space. That would lower the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. So lambda would increase, right? Because when pressure P decreases, lambda increases.

Wait, but the initial lambda1 was calculated when the system was at ultra-high vacuum. When the beam is on, if some gas molecules are removed (because they're ionized and stuck to the walls), the pressure in the chamber would go down. So the new pressure is lower than what was there before. Since lambda is proportional to 1/P, a lower P would mean a larger lambda. So lambda2 would be larger than lambda1. So lambda2 > lambda1.

But wait, the options don't have that directly. Let me look again. The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
B) λ2 = λ1, so Mike's observation is wrong.
C) λ2 < λ1
D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Wait, so the question is, why would lambda2 differ from lambda1? Because when the electron beam is on, more gas particles are being removed from the system. So the pressure decreases, so lambda increases.

So lambda2 would be larger than lambda1. But looking at the options, the only option where lambda2 is larger is option A and D (since D is between lambda1 and 1.22*lambda1). But option A is lambda2 >= 1.22*lambda1. Hmm.

Wait, what determines the mean free path? The formula is lambda = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*pi*d^2*P). So if the pressure drops when the beam is on, then lambda increases. So lambda2 is larger than lambda1. So which options say that lambda2 is bigger?

Option A says lambda2 is >= 1.22 times lambda1. Option D says lambda2 is bigger than lambda1 but less than 1.22 times. So which is correct?

Wait, why would lambda2 be more than lambda1? Because the pressure is lower, so lambda increases.

But how much does the pressure change? The initial pressure was already super low, so maybe the effect is minimal. But Mike's observation is that the mean free path changed, so lambda2 is different.

Wait, let's think about the processes. When the electron beam is on, it can cause gas molecules to be ionized. Ionized gas molecules (ions) are more likely to be attracted to the walls, which are probably grounded or have a potential. So the ions would be pulled towards the walls, effectively removing them from the vacuum chamber. This reduces the number of neutral gas particles in the chamber, which reduces the pressure. So P decreases, so lambda increases. So lambda2 is larger than lambda1.

But why would the mean free path change? Because the presence of the electron beam is causing the gas to be depleted.

But wait, the mean free path is determined by the gas's own collisions. If the pressure drops, the mean free path would increase. So when Mike starts the electron beam, the pressure effectively drops, leading to a longer mean free path.

But in the initial state (without the beam), the pressure was P, leading to lambda1. When the beam is on, P drops, so lambda2 is bigger than lambda1.

So the correct conclusion is that lambda2 > lambda1. Now, looking back at the options, which ones have lambda2 larger than lambda1?

Option A: lambda2 >= 1.22 * lambda1
Option C: lambda2 < lambda1 (no)
Option B: same as lambda1
Option D: lambda2 is between lambda1 and 1.22 lambda1.

But why would the change be less than 1.22 times? Is there a reason?

Wait, the mean free path formula is lambda = k*T/(sqrt(2) * pi * d^2 * P). So lambda is inversely proportional to P.

If the pressure drops by a factor x, then lambda increases by x.

So, for example, if the original pressure was P, and now it's P', then lambda2 = (P / P') * lambda1.

But how much does P' decrease?

When the electron beam is on, the ionization rate increases. So the rate at which gas molecules are removed from the chamber depends on the beam's intensity. But in the problem statement, Mike found that the mean free path changed, so perhaps the pressure drops significantly.

But without specific numbers, I need to think about the options.

The question says that before the beam is on, the mean free path is lambda1. When the beam is on, it's lambda2, and the question is whether lambda2 is larger or smaller than lambda1.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, but if the pressure is already super low, the mean free path might be dominated by other factors. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes more scattering events, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Because the mean free path is about the average distance between collisions of the gas molecules themselves. So if the beam isn't affecting the gas molecules' own collisions, but perhaps causing them to leave the chamber, the pressure would drop, so lambda increases.

So lambda2 must be larger than lambda1.

Looking at the options, the only ones where lambda2 > lambda1 are options A and D.

Why would the change be exactly 1.22 times? Hmm, perhaps because when the electron beam is on, the pressure drops by a factor that makes lambda2 about 1.22 times lambda1. But I don't know why 1.22 specifically.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path isn't solely dependent on pressure but also on the cross-section. But that's already in the formula.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is present, it might cause the gas molecules to be more energetic, perhaps increasing their speed. Since mean free path depends on velocity, but the formula already includes temperature (k*T). So if temperature is same, velocity is same. So that shouldn't change.

Hmm, maybe the presence of the electron beam leads to additional gas molecule loss, but the effect on pressure isn't enough to make lambda2 more than 1.22 times lambda1. So lambda2 is between lambda1 and 1.22 lambda1, which is option D.

Wait, but without knowing the exact change in pressure, it's hard to say. The problem states that Mike accurately determined lambda1 based on sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. But when the beam is on, the pressure changes because some gas is removed, which affects lambda.

So the only way lambda2 is greater than lambda1 is if the pressure decreases. So why would the options have it as either A or D?

Wait, maybe the electron beam's presence affects the gas in a way that the mean free path isn't just about molecule-molecule collisions. Oh, wait! Maybe when the electron beam is on, the electrons are more likely to scatter off the gas molecules, which changes the effective mean free path. But wait, in that case, the mean free path would decrease because more scattering events occur. Hmm, but that's not what I thought earlier.

Wait, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another. If the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be scattered more (like by the electrons), that would increase the rate of collisions, thus decreasing the mean free path. So lambda2 would be less than lambda1.

Ah, wait, that's a different scenario. So if the electron beam causes more collisions between the gas molecules and electrons, that would make the gas molecules collide more, thereby reducing their mean free path.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The mean free path is about the distance between two gas molecule collisions. If the electrons in the beam are causing the gas molecules to scatter (like electron-molecule collisions), that adds more scattering events. But wait, that's an additional collision source beyond gas-gas collisions.

So the presence of the electron beam would cause the gas molecules to have more collisions, not just with other gas molecules but with the electrons. So the mean free path would be shorter, because the gas molecules are colliding more frequently—either with each other or with the electrons.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, lambda1 was determined without the electron beam. That calculation probably considered only gas-gas collisions. But when the beam is on, the gas molecules can collide with the electrons as well. So the effective collision rate increases, meaning the mean free path decreases.

So lambda2 would be less than lambda1.

Wait, that makes sense now. Because when the beam is on, the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, leading to more frequent collisions. Thus, the mean free path would be shorter than lambda1.

So in that case, lambda2 < lambda1, which is option C.

But wait, how does the electron's presence affect the gas molecules' collision rate? The gas molecules are in a vacuum, so their main collisions are with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at high speeds. However, for each gas molecule, the probability of it colliding with an electron would depend on the electron flux and the cross-section for electron-molecule scattering.

But in the initial scenario, the gas pressure is already ultra-low, so the gas density is very low. The mean free path is long because the gas molecules don't collide often.

When the electron beam is on, each gas molecule might have a higher chance of scattering off an electron because the electron beam is introducing a lot of moving charges. So the gas molecules will collide more with the electrons, which effectively adds to their collision rate, making their mean free path shorter.

Wait, but how does that affect the overall mean free path? Because the mean free path is determined by the rate of collisions between gas molecules. If the electron beam causes additional collisions (with the electrons), then the gas molecules are colliding more frequently, so the mean free path would be shorter.

So the mean free path would be lambda2 = lambda1 * (1 + (electron collision rate)/(gas collision rate))^-1.

Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the presence of the electron beam adds more ways for the gas molecules to collide (with the beam particles), the mean free path should decrease.

So lambda2 < lambda1. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Initially, I thought the pressure would drop, increasing the mean free path. But now I'm thinking that the electron beam causes more collisions, decreasing the mean free path.

Which effect dominates? Let's think again.

Scenario 1: Electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed (ionized and stuck on walls), which reduces pressure, leading to longer mean free path (lambda2 > lambda1).

Scenario 2: Electron beam causes gas molecules to collide more (with electrons), leading to shorter mean free path (lambda2 < lambda1).

Which effect is more significant?

In an ultra-high vacuum, the gas density is very low. The mean free path lambda1 is already very large because the pressure is so low. If the electron beam is on, the beam's particles (electrons) are moving at a high velocity. The cross-section for electron-molecule scattering is probably small, but the number of electrons is high.

But in a high-resolution TEM, the electron beam has a very low current because high currents would damage the sample or cause other issues. So maybe the number of electrons is not that high.

Alternatively, the molecules in the gas are moving, and each can be hit by an electron, which may ionize them. Once ionized, they stick to the walls, so they're removed from the system. That would lower the pressure, increasing the mean free path.

Wait, but wait. If the gas is almost all gone because of being ionized and stuck to the walls, then the pressure would drop, so lambda increases. But the question says that the mass spectrometer detects gas particles, so the initial pressure is already non-zero but very low. When the beam is on, maybe some of those gas particles are ionized and removed, so P decreases, lambda increases.

So lambda2 should be larger than lambda1.

But earlier, I thought that the electron beam would cause more collisions. But maybe the main effect is that the pressure drops, leading to longer mean free path.

Wait, but in the beginning, the mean free path lambda1 is determined based on the actual pressure. When the electron beam is on, the pressure is effectively lower, so lambda2 = (P_initial / P_beam) * lambda1.

So if P_beam < P_initial, then lambda2 > lambda1.

In this case, the presence of the beam leads to lower pressure, hence longer mean free path.

So the conclusion is lambda2 > lambda1.

Looking back at the options, the only options where lambda2 is larger than lambda1 are A and D.

But why would the mean free path not be significantly larger than lambda1? Because the pressure change might not be that drastic.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't cause a huge change in pressure. Maybe the number of gas molecules removed is small compared to the initial number, leading to a small increase in lambda. So lambda2 would be just a bit larger than lambda1.

But in the options, option D says lambda2 is between lambda1 and 1.22 lambda1. So if the pressure drops but not by a huge factor, that would make sense.

Alternatively, option A says lambda2 is at least 1.22 times lambda1, which would happen if the pressure drops by a factor of about 0.82 (since 1/0.82 ≈ 1.22).

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, it's hard to say whether lambda2 is just a little bigger or more than 1.22 times.

Wait, the question states that the mean free path "was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same." So the change is due to the electron beam.

But another angle: the presence of the electron beam creates an electric field. The gas molecules, if ionized, would be accelerated towards the walls, leading to a lower effective pressure in the compartment. But again, it's unclear by how much.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be heated, but the temperature is stated to be the same, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe the electrons cause the gas to ionize, but ionized gas (plasma) has different behavior. However, in ultra-high vacuum, the ionization would cause the ions to quickly hit the walls and the electrons to maybe get neutralized, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's recap:

If the electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed (ionized and stuck on walls), then the pressure P decreases, so lambda increases. So lambda2 > lambda1.

Therefore, the correct options are A or D. 

But the question is about the conclusion. The possible options for lambda2 are given, and we have to choose which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is that the electron beam causes more scattering, which would decrease the mean free path. But earlier I thought that the main effect is the pressure dropping, increasing lambda.

Wait, another possibility is that the electron beam introduces more gas molecules into the compartment. No, that doesn't make sense. The pumps are already creating ultra-high vacuum, so the presence of the beam wouldn't introduce more gas.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be excited, but that doesn't change the pressure much.

I think the main effect is the beam causing gas molecules to be ionized and removed, leading to lower pressure and thus longer mean free path. So lambda2 would be larger than lambda1.

Looking again at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So if the pressure drops by a factor that makes lambda2 about 1.22 times larger, then option A would be correct. But if it's only slightly bigger, say, 1.1 times, then option D would be correct.

But the problem says that Mike accurately determined lambda1. So when he starts the beam, he observes a different mean free path. But the problem doesn't give any numbers, so I have to choose based on reasoning.

I think the correct answer is that lambda2 is larger than lambda1. So the options are A or D. Without knowing exactly how much, but considering that the presence of the beam would cause a significant change, perhaps lambda2 is larger than lambda1 but not by much, so D could be the answer.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about another approach.

The mean free path formula is lambda = k*T/(sqrt(2)*pi*d^2*P). So if the pressure P drops, lambda increases.

But for the same T and d, lambda is inversely proportional to P. So if after starting the beam, the pressure is lower (P2 < P1), then lambda2 = (P1/P2) * lambda1.

If P2 is less than P1, lambda2 is greater than lambda1.

So the conclusion is lambda2 > lambda1. So the correct options are A or D.

But the question is, which one is correct?

Another angle: the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to be more ionized, which effectively increases the cross-section for collisions. Wait, but that's when considering electron-molecule collisions, but the mean free path for gas molecules is about their own collisions. So maybe the mean free path isn't affected, but the electron beam can cause the gas to be removed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about it differently. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized. Once ionized, they stick to the walls, reducing the number of neutral gas molecules. This reduces the pressure, so the mean free path increases.

So yes, lambda2 > lambda1.

So the options are A or D. But which is correct?

I think in this case, the pressure change is small because the initial pressure is already very low. So the mean free path doesn't increase by much, hence lambda2 is just a bit larger than lambda1, which would put it in option D.

Wait, but the question states that when the beam is on, Mike found the mean free path was no longer equal to lambda1. So the change must be significant enough to be noticed. But without exact data, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't affect the pressure much but affects the effective collision cross-section. For example, when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to scatter electrons, which would increase their effective collision rate, leading to a shorter mean free path. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be electrostatically deflected, leading to more collisions. But that's not directly affecting the pressure.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the problem says the temperature remains the same.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of what's more likely. The primary effect of the electron beam in this scenario is likely to remove gas molecules from the chamber, thus reducing the pressure and increasing the mean free path. So lambda2 > lambda1.

So the options are A or D.

But why would the mean free path not be much larger? Because the initial pressure is already extremely low. For example, if the initial pressure was 1e-9 Torr, and the beam causes it to drop to 8e-10 Torr, then lambda would increase by a factor of 1e-9 / 8e-10 = 1.25, which is just over 1.22. So in that case, option A would be correct.

Alternatively, if the pressure drops to 9e-10 Torr, lambda increases by a factor of about 1.11, which would fall under option D.

But without knowing the exact pressure change, it's hard to say. But given that the question says that some gas particles remained, and the presence of the beam changes the mean free path, perhaps the pressure change is such that lambda2 is larger than lambda1, but not by more than 1.22 times.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the presence of the beam causes the mean free path to decrease, making lambda2 < lambda1, which would be option C.

But I think the correct reasoning is that the pressure decreases, so lambda increases. So the answer should be either A or D.

Wait, another point: the mean free path also depends on the number density of the gas, n. n is proportional to P. So when P drops, n drops, so the mean free path increases.

The initial mean free path was calculated under the existing pressure, so when the beam is on and P drops, the mean free path increases.

Thus, the conclusion is that lambda2 is greater than lambda1.

So among the options, it's either A or D.

But if the pressure drops by a factor of 0.82 (so 1/0.82 ≈ 1.22), then lambda2 would be 1.22 times lambda1. So if the pressure drops by that factor, option A is correct.

Alternatively, if the pressure drops by a smaller factor, then lambda2 is between lambda1 and 1.22*lambda1.

But without knowing the exact factor, the question probably expects us to recognize that lambda2 is longer than lambda1, which would suggest that the correct options are A or D.

But wait, another thought: in a vacuum, the mean free path is determined by the gas density. If the electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed, the density decreases, and the mean free path increases. But the initial pressure was already very low, so the mean free path was large. The beam's presence might not cause a huge change, so the mean free path might not increase by much. So lambda2 is just a bit larger than lambda1, which points to option D.

Another way to think about it: if the pressure drops by x, then lambda increases by 1/x.

If the pressure is initially P, and drops to P', then lambda2 = lambda1 * (P / P').

Assuming that the pressure drops by about 20%, then lambda2 would be 1.25 times lambda1. So option A's 1.22 is close to that.

But in reality, the pressure might not drop by that much because the vacuum was already ultra-high. So perhaps the mean free path only increases by a small amount, making option D correct.

But the problem says that upon initiating the beam, the mean free path changes. So the change is significant enough, meaning that lambda2 is definitely larger than lambda1. So the options are A or D.

I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, no. Earlier analysis suggests that the pressure drops, so lambda increases. So option C is wrong.

Now, after all this, I think the correct conclusion is lambda2 > lambda1, so either A or D.

But since the problem statement doesn't give exact numbers, I have to choose based on the options. Since the options don't provide a clear indication, perhaps the answer is A: lambda2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 times lambda1.

But why 1.22? 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (sqrt(2)) ), no, wait: sqrt(2) is about 1.414. Hmm, perhaps it's a factor from some other calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that lambda2 is less than lambda1, which would make option C the correct choice. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the mean free path represents in electron microscopy. In electron microscopy, the mean free path is critical because if the electrons are scattered more, the resolution is worse. If the gas particles are causing more scattering, the mean free path for electrons would be shorter. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, though.

Wait, the question says that Mike measured the mean free path of the gas molecules as lambda1, but when the beam is on, the gas molecules' mean free path is lambda2.

Wait, but why would the electron beam affect the gas molecules' mean free path? The gas's mean free path depends on their own collisions. If the beam doesn't affect their density or pressure, then lambda remains the same. But if the beam causes ionization and removal, then the pressure drops, lambda increases.

So in that case, lambda2 is larger. So the correct conclusion is that lambda2 is larger than lambda1.

Thus, the options are A or D.

But the problem gives these options, and I can't be certain of the exact multiplier. Since the problem states that the mean free path was detected to change, it's likely that lambda2 is greater than lambda1. So, the correct answer must be either A or D.

But without more data, I can't choose between them. Since the problem doesn't indicate a specific multiplier, and the options don't include a 'lambda2 > lambda1' option, I think the intended answer is that lambda2 is larger than lambda1, so it's either A or D.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1 → incorrect

C) λ2 < λ1 → incorrect

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So the options are between A and D.

Given that the initial pressure is already extremely low, the presence of the beam may not cause a drastic change in pressure, so lambda2 is only modestly larger than lambda1, which would put it in option D.

Alternatively, the factor of 1.22 comes from the fact that when the pressure is reduced by 1/0.82, lambda increases by 1.22. But without knowing, it's hard.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is option C: lambda2 < lambda1. But I'm not entirely confident, given the earlier reasoning. Alternatively, given that the pressure drops, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no, earlier reasoning says the pressure drops, so lambda increases. So the correct answer is lambda2 > lambda1. So either A or D.

But the question says the mean free path was no longer equal to lambda1, which suggests a change. So the options are A or D.

But since the initial pressure was already ultra-low, the pressure drop caused by the beam might not be that significant, so lambda2 is just a bit bigger. So option D.

Wait, but the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path; the electron beam's presence may not directly affect their pressure but could affect how the mean free path is measured.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more mobile, but that doesn't affect lambda.

Hmm, I'm stuck. But given the options and the reasoning, I think the correct conclusion is that lambda2 is larger than lambda1. So the answer is either A or D.

Looking at the options, if the pressure drops by a certain amount, the mean free path increases. Since the initial pressure is already very low, the change can't be too big, so lambda2 is just a bit larger than lambda1. Hence, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) under two conditions: when the electron beam is off (λ₁) and when the electron beam is on (λ₂). The key factors influencing the mean free path are pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter, as described by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is temperature, \(d\) is molecular diameter, and \(P\) is pressure. The mean free path increases as pressure decreases.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State (λ₁):**  
   When the electron beam is off, the vacuum pumps maintain an ultra-high vacuum (\(< 10^{-9}\) Torr). Mike calculates the mean free path as λ₁ based on the existing pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter.

2. **State with Electron Beam On (λ₂):**  
   When the electron beam is turned on, several effects could influence the gas molecules:
   - **Pressure Drop:** The electron beam can ionize gas molecules, causing them to stick to the walls of the sample compartment. This reduces the effective pressure (\(P\)), which increases the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).
   - **Additional Collisions:** The electron beam may also cause gas molecules to collide with electrons, potentially increasing the collision rate and reducing the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).

3. **Temperature Constraint:**  
   The problem specifies that the temperature remains constant, so it does not directly affect the comparison between λ₁ and λ₂.

4. **Key Conclusion:**  
   The primary effect of the electron beam is likely the removal of gas molecules due to ionization, leading to a reduction in pressure and an increase in the mean free path. Thus, λ₂ > λ₁.

5. **Options Analysis:**  
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\)):** This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path, which could occur if the pressure drops by a substantial factor (e.g., a pressure reduction to approximately 82% of the initial pressure).
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\)):** This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the problem statement that λ₂ ≠ λ₁.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)):** This suggests the mean free path decreases, which is inconsistent with the pressure drop caused by ionization and gas removal.
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\)):** This implies a modest increase in the mean free path, consistent with a small pressure drop due to the ultra-high vacuum already being very low.

### Final Conclusion:
Given the ultra-high vacuum and the likely modest pressure drop caused by the electron beam, the mean free path increases slightly, making λ₂ lie between λ₁ and 1.22λ₁. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
