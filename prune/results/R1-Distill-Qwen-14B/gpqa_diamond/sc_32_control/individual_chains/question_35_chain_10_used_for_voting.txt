Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me read the question again and break it down.

So, the operator A_y is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The question is about which statement is correct during this calculation.

First, I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. So, let's write down the matrix A_y.

Wait, c is h/(4π), and S is given. So A_y is c multiplied by S. Let me compute that. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply by c, each element becomes c times the respective element in S.

So A_y would be:
[ [0, c*(-i)], [c*i, 0] ]
Which is [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ]

Now, the eigenvalues are found by solving the determinant of (A_y - λ I) = 0.

Let's set up the matrix (A_y - λ I):
[ [-λ, -i c], [i c, -λ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Let me compute (-i c)(i c). Multiply them: (-i)(i) * c². Since i*(-i) is (i^2) = -1, so (-i)*(i) is - (i²) = -(-1) = 1. So it becomes 1 * c².

So the determinant equation is λ² - ( (1) * c² ) = 0 → λ² = c². Therefore, λ = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are c and -c. Wait, but c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because S is a spin-1/2 operator, so its eigenvalues would be ±(ħ/2). Wait, but in this case, A_y is c·S, so the eigenvalues would be c * (± ħ/2), but wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, S is the Pauli matrices scaled by something? Let me think.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each having eigenvalues ±1. But in this case, S is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps similar to a Pauli matrix.

Wait, the matrix S given is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute S squared. S^2 would be:

(0)(0) + (−i)(i) → for (1,1) element: (0)(0) + (−i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

Similarly, for the (1,2) element: (0)(i) + (−i)(0) = 0.

(2,1): (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

(2,2): (i)(i) + (0)(0) → i^2 = -1.

Wait, wait, no, matrix multiplication for S^2:

First row, first column: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = 1.

First row, second column: (0)(i) + (-i)(0) = 0.

Second row, first column: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

Second row, second column: (i)(i) + (0)(0) = i^2 = -1.

So S^2 = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. That's the same as the identity matrix multiplied by 1, but wait, it's diagonal with 1 and -1.

Wait, but for a spin-1/2 system, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1/2? No, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. Wait, actually, for spin operators, S is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin angular momentum is S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait a second, but in this problem, the operator A_y is given as c·S, with c = h/(4π). Hmm. Let's compute that.

Wait, since h = 2π ħ, so c = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

Then, A_y = c·S = (ħ/2) S.

But S is the matrix given, which I think is (like σ_y), because the Pauli matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σ_y. So A_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y's eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-calculate. Because the original A_y is c·S, and c is h/(4π). Since h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * S, and S is σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y's eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 * 1 = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in the question, the options refer to a being the eigenvalue. So a would be ± ħ/2.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary part of eigenvalue are ±2πh, real ± h/(4π). That can't be right because our eigenvalues are real, not complex.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Again, the eigenvalues are real, so this can't apply. Maybe they're talking about other values, but I think the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, wait. Wait, the eigenvalues of A_y are ± ħ/2. So, which option talks about real eigenvalues?

Looking at the options:

Option C: Eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, the square of the angular momentum operator is A² = A_x² + A_y² + A_z², which for spin-1/2 would have eigenvalues (ħ²)(s(s+1)) where s=1/2. So A² has eigenvalue (3/4) ħ². So if phi is an eigenvector of A_y, then A² phi would be (3/4 ħ²) phi, so yes, phi is also an eigenfunction of A². But what about Az? The eigenfunctions of A_y and Az may not be the same, since they are different components. So for eigenfunctions of A_y, they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because they don't commute. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. Not sure about that. Basis functions usually refer to the basis vectors (like the standard basis). But the eigenfunctions are eigenvectors of Ay, so they form a basis for the space. So in that sense, D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which might be correct. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but looking back, the options are about statements made during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, let me go back to the eigenvalues. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's look at the options again.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. I think that eigenfunctions form an orthogonal basis, but the basis functions are typically in the Hilbert space. Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions are the basis for the space on which A_y acts. So, in that case, D might be correct, but I'm not certain.

But let me think about the correct eigenvalues. I thought they are ± ħ/2. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±1/2, and real ±1. That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues are real.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A^2, which is true because A^2 is a scalar multiple of the identity in spin-1/2 systems, so any state is an eigenstate of A^2. Wait, actually, A^2 is (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2), which for spin-1/2 particles is (3/4) ħ² I, so any vector is an eigenstate of A^2. So if phi is an eigenstate of Ay, then yes, it's also an eigenstate of A², but it's not an eigenstate of Az. So option C seems correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm. The basis functions are usually independent of the operator. Each operator has its own eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis for the space, but whether they are the basis functions of Ay's matrix operator... Not sure. The matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for R² (or C², but perhaps in this case, since spin-1/2, it's a two-dimensional space). So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator's space. So D's statement is correct? Or is it perhaps not correct because the basis functions are usually the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions are just another basis?

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are orthogonal and form a basis, so D would be correct. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but looking back, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. As I said, any state is an eigenstate of A^2, so yes, phi is an eigenstate of A^2. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. The matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are a basis. So D is correct as well. But wait, the basis functions are typically the standard basis vectors; the eigenvectors form a different basis. So I think D is correct, but I'm not 100% confident.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's see the options again.

Option C: ...eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

So between options C and D, which is correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The matrix has eigenvectors as basis, so yes, phi forms a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Let me list the possible eigenvalues and options.

Eigenvalues of Ay: ± ħ/2. So which option refers to this?

Looking at the options, none of the options A or B seem correct because their eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which they don't.

So the only options left are C and D.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² and Ay commute, yes, they share eigenfunctions. But Az and Ay don't commute, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix. The matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are a basis for the space, so D is correct. So both C and D could be correct statements.

But wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, perhaps the basis functions (eigenfunctions) form a basis, but the matrix's basis is not necessarily the eigenfunctions. I think the standard basis is [[1,0]] and [[0,1]], but the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So how correct is D?

Alternatively, the matrix Ay operates on the space, and its eigenfunctions form a basis for that space. So D is correct.

Wait, but both C and D could be correct. But looking back, the question gives four options and asks which is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Let me check the options again.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. No, eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect.

Option A: eigenvalue imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real.

So options C and D are the only possible correct ones.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should consider other aspects.

Another approach: compute the matrix Ay and find the eigenvectors.

Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Let's write it out.

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So Ay = [[0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]

Now, to find eigenvalues, as I did before, the eigenvalues are ± c, which is ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait, wait! Earlier I thought that c is ħ/2 because h = 2π ħ. Let me recompute c.

c = h/(4π) → since h = 2π ħ → c = (2π ħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2.

So, c = ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that A_y = c S = (ħ/2) S. And S has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real.

So looking back at the options, only options C and D are left.

Now, the eigenvectors of Ay would be the eigenfunctions phi. So any phi is a linear combination of these eigenvectors.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. The matrix operator is represented in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors form a different basis. So D's statement is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, regardless of which basis the matrix is represented in.

So both C and D seem correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question is about the calculation process. So the correct statements would be about the properties.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². That is correct because A² is a Casimir operator and commutes with all components.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. That is true because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are exclusive.

Wait, no, the options are independent. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But the options may not allow that.

Wait, let's read the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Which is correct?

I think both are correct. But wait, the question is giving four options, and you have to choose one.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is incorrect, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are not necessarily eigenfunctions of Az, but they are eigenfunctions of A².

So, which of the options is correct?

The question says, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So during the calculation, when I'm finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement holds.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

That is correct because A² and Ay commute (since [A², Ay] = 0), so they share eigenfunctions. But Ay and Az do not commute, so their eigenfunctions do not coincide.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's also correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis. So maybe both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the matrix's basis is the standard basis, not the eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions are a different basis, so D is incorrect.

Alternatively, the basis functions are the eigenfunctions of the operator. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is incorrect. Because the operator's matrix representation is in some basis, but the eigenfunctions are another basis.

So during the calculation, when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but they aren't necessarily the basis functions of the matrix operator, which is represented in another basis (like the computational basis).

So perhaps D is incorrect, and C is correct.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), we compute:

\[
A_y = c \cdot S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i c \\ i c & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The characteristic equation becomes:

\[
\det \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -i c \\ i c & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - (c^2) = 0.
\]

Solving this gives the eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = \pm c.
\]

Since \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
#### **Option A**:
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and there are no imaginary components.

#### **Option B**:
This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and the values given do not match the calculated eigenvalues.

#### **Option C**:
This option asserts that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of the angular momentum operator). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

#### **Option D**:
This option claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space in which \( A_y \) operates, the term "basis functions of the matrix operator" could be interpreted as referring to the standard basis (e.g., the computational basis). Since the eigenfunctions are a different basis, this statement is ambiguous and less precise than Option C.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the commuting operator \( A^2 \), while also correctly noting that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
