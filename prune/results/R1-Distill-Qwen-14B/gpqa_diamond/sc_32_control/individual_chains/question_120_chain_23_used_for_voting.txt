Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space, right? So, same number of stars per volume in every region.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance—closer stars have larger parallaxes. Parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, if a star is closer, its parallax is bigger. 

Wait, the number of stars per unit parallax range. Oh, I remember that the number of stars you can see in a certain direction depends on how far away those stars are. But here it's about the distribution. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the actual density (number per unit volume) is constant. But how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax (p) is 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So when p increases, d decreases. So small p means distant stars.

But we're looking at how the count of stars (per unit parallax) changes. Let's model this. Suppose we have a range of parallaxes from p to p + dp. How many stars are there in that range?

The number of stars depends on the volume of space between p and p + dp. Wait, but since p is related to distance, I should express volume in terms of p. 

The distance d is 1/p. So, for a small change in p, the corresponding change in d is dd = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, because d = 1/p, so derivative is -1/p².

The volume between d and d + dd is the volume of a spherical shell. The volume is 4π r² dr, right? So here, dr = dd, which is -(1/p²) dp. So the volume element dV is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, r is d, so as d goes from d to d + dd, the volume is 4π (d)^2 (dd). But dd is -1/p² dp. Since d = 1/p, then d^2 is 1/p². So substituting:

dV = 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² dp ) ) 

Wait, that's 4π (1/p^4) (-dp). But since we're dealing with the magnitude, dp is positive, so it's 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But we're looking for the number of stars in this volume. Since the density is uniform, the number of stars is density multiplied by dV. Let’s say the density is n stars per cubic parsec. So, number of stars N is n * dV.

So N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So, per unit dp. So N is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because dV is 4π (d^2) dd, and d = 1/p, so d^2 is (1/p)^2, and dd is - (1/p^2) dp.

So dV = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the volume is proportional to 1/p^4.

Since the number of stars is n * dV, which is n * (4π / p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit dp is n * (4π / p^4) *1. So the number per unit plx range is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is the number per unit parallax or per unit range? The question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So, it's the number in each parallax interval. So, for a given p, the number in a small dp is N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So N per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

So yeah, A is the answer.

The question involves determining how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), such that \( p = 1/d \). The goal is to find the relationship between the number of stars in a small range of parallax \( dp \) and \( p \).

To analyze this, consider the volume of a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of the shell is given by \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since \( d = 1/p \), we have \( dd = -1/p^2 dp \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -1/p^2 dp \) into the expression for \( dV \), we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change in \( d \), but since we are interested in the magnitude, we take \( dV = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp \).

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the density of stars (\( n \)) multiplied by the volume (\( dV \)). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dp \)) is:

\[
N \propto n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{p^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim 1/p^4 \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
