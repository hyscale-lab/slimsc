Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and then determine which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, let me think. Angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. For spin-1/2 particles like the muon, the spin matrices are known. The Pauli matrices, perhaps? But wait, the matrix S given here doesn't look exactly like the Pauli matrices I'm familiar with.

Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall:
σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Oh wait, the S matrix given here has the same structure as σ_y. Because the first row is 0 and -i, second row is i and 0. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is σ_y.

So A_y = c * σ_y. And c is h/(4π).

Now, the eigenvalue equation for A_y is A_y φ = a φ. Since A_y is proportional to σ_y, and σ_y is a Hermitian matrix, A_y should be Hermitian as well because c is a real constant. So the eigenvalues a should be real.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. Because for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. So multiplying by c, the eigenvalues a would be c * 1 and c * (-1), so a = ±c.

c is h/(4π). So a = h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. Because the matrix A_y is Hermitian, its eigenvalues must be real.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). But that's impossible because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but eigenvalues are real here, so B is also incorrect because it's suggesting complex eigenvalues.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. The square of angular momentum (A²) would have eigenvalues related to the total angular momentum. Since the particle is spin-1/2, A² should have eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2+1)ħ², where ħ is h/(2π). Wait, but in this problem, the operator is A_y, which is just the y-component. So A^2 would be (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. But wait, each A component would be c times the corresponding Pauli matrix. So A_x would be c σ_x, A_y c σ_y, etc. Then, A² would be (c^2)(σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2). Each Pauli matrix squared is identity matrix, because σ_i^2 = I. So σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z² = 3I. So A² = c² *3 I.

So any eigenvector of A_y is an eigenvector of A², as A² is proportional to identity matrix, which commutes with everything. So if φ is an eigenvector of A_y, then A² φ = (3 c^2) φ. So the statement in option C is "the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az." The first part is correct because A² has the same eigenvectors as the identity matrix. But the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Is that true?

Well, for a spin-1/2 system, any eigenvector of one component of angular momentum (say A_y) is not an eigenvector of another component (like A_z) because they don't commute. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

But wait, let me check the other options first.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, basis functions usually refer to the eigenvectors forming a basis. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenvectors, which are orthogonal and form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct. But does it make sense?

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct. So if both C and D are correct, I have to check. Or perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but I'm not sure if that's what the option is saying. Alternatively, the basis functions of the operator are the eigenvectors, which is correct. So D is a correct statement.

But looking back at the options, let's see which of the four is correct.

So for the eigenvalues, the real parts are ±h/(4π). So option A is wrong because it includes imaginary parts. Option B has eigenvalues as ±1/2 and ±1, which doesn't match because our a is ±h/(4π). So options A and B are out.

Now, between C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As discussed, yes, because A² is the same for all states (since it's 3 c² I), so any state is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue 3 c². So the first part is correct. The second part is also correct because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, so their eigenvectors are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis of the space, which is true. But perhaps the option is a bit ambiguous. But perhaps it's correct.

Wait, let's think more about the statements.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Since A^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix, every vector is an eigenfunction of A^2, regardless of being an eigenfunction of Ay. So any φ is an eigenfunction of A^2. So the first part of C is correct.

The second part of C says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because Az and Ay don't commute. So the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So C's statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I think that means that the operator's basis is built from its eigenvectors. But in a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors do form a basis, but usually, the basis refers to the standard basis (like |+> and |-> for spin-up and spin-down along some axis). So the eigenvectors of Ay may not be the standard basis. But the statement says they are the basis functions of the matrix operator, which might be correct in the sense that the eigenvectors form a basis. So D's statement is correct as well.

Wait, but the options are asking which statement is correct. Are both C and D correct? Or is only one correct?

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. The question is about the calculation process—what statement will you consider correct during the calculation?

So when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of these statements is correct.

So let's think about each option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this wording. Basis functions of the operator? Maybe the operator's matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis. So if you diagonalize Ay, its matrix becomes diagonal, with eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator. So D's statement could be correct.

Now, looking again at the options, both C and D could be correct. But the options are exclusive. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvalues again. The eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, where c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So for option C, the statement says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². A² is (c^2)(σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2) = c^2 * 3 I. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue 3 c². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But the statement says 'can also be' which is correct.

Additionally, the statement says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because [Ay, Az] = iħ (or some multiple) in the angular momentum algebra, so they don't share eigenvectors.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the wording. The basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which are the eigenvectors. So the statement is correct.

Wait, but the problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So if both C and D are correct, but I have to choose, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. The matrix Ay is 2x2. Its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but why is option D correct? Because the operator is represented in some basis, and the eigenfunctions form a basis for that operator. So yes, D is correct.

But the problem is, which of the given options is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is incorrect because the basis functions are not necessarily the same as the eigenfunctions. Because in this case, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the operator's representation in that basis.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the standard basis. The matrix S is given as [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. So the standard basis is |+x> and |–x> maybe? Not sure. Alternatively, the standard basis is computational basis, but the eigenvectors of Ay would be along the y-axis.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

A² has eigenvalue 3 c² for all states, including the eigenfunctions of Ay. So the first part is correct. The second part is correct because Ay and Az don't share eigenvectors. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps the statement is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct as well.

But the options are multiple-choice, so only one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) Im part ±2πh, real ±h/(4π): No, eigenvalues are real.

B) Im part ±1/2, real ±1: No, eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Now, which is correct?

Well, since A² is a multiple of identity, any state is an eigenfunction of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct.

The second part, about not being eigenfunctions of Az, is correct because Az and Ay don't commute. Hence, their eigenvectors are different.

Hence, option C's statement is correct.

Option D's statement is also correct. But the options are presented as four options, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are designed such that only one is correct.

Wait, but the way the problem is set up, I think only one option is correct. So perhaps my analysis of option D is incorrect.

Wait, let's think about the operator Ay. The matrix S is given, which is the Pauli Y matrix. So the operator is A_y = c σ_y.

The eigenfunctions of A_y are the eigenvectors of σ_y. The eigenvectors for σ_y are the states |+y> and |–y>, which are eigenstates for the Y-component.

Now, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So in the basis of |+y> and |–y>, the matrix Ay would be diagonal. So yes, the eigenvectors form a basis, and the operator is diagonal in that basis. So D's statement is correct.

But wait, the standard basis for 2x2 matrices is the computational basis, which is |0> and |1>, or in spin terms, spin-up and spin-down along z-axis. So if the matrix S is given in the standard basis, then the eigenfunctions of Ay would be in a different basis. So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, regardless of the original basis. So D is correct.

But now, if both C and D are correct, that's a problem because the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that option D is correct.

Wait, looking at option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

So the operator's 'basis functions' would be the basis in which the operator is represented. Wait, but the operator is given as a matrix in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions may not be the same as the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So perhaps the statement in D is incorrect.

Wait, no, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So if you have the eigenvectors as your basis, the matrix becomes diagonal. So D's statement is correct.

But wait, the operator is given in the standard basis, which might not be the same as the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator's representation in its eigenbasis. So the statement is correct.

So now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option.

Option C: The statement is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², which is true, and not of Az, which is also true.

Option D: The statement is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator.

So it's possible that both C and D are correct, but looking back at the problem, it's a multiple-choice question, so only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The problem asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is 3c² I, any φ is an eigenfunction of A². So the first part is correct.

The second part: Are the eigenfunctions of Ay eigenfunctions of Az? No, because Az and Ay don't commute. So the second part is correct.

So option C is correct.

What about option D? It says the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Assuming the matrix is represented in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So perhaps in their own basis, the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors. So D's statement is correct.

Hmm, but the options are presented as four, and only one is correct. So I must have made a mistake in thinking.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the matrix operator has eigenvectors that form a basis for the operator. But the operator is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the problem states the matrix operator is given as Ay = c·S, with S given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the standard Pauli Y matrix in the computational basis. The eigenvectors of S (and hence Ay) are |+y> and |–y>, which are orthogonal. So they form a basis for the space.

So D's statement is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's space. So both C and D seem correct, but perhaps the question is only considering one.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² is the same for all, any state is an eigenfunction of A². So the first part of C is correct.

The second part, not being eigenfunctions of Az, is correct. So C is correct.

Option D's statement is also correct. But perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's more about the properties of the eigenfunctions with respect to other operators.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So A_y = c S where c = h/(4π).

The eigenvalues of S are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A_y are c*(±1) = ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real. So any options suggesting complex eigenvalues (A and B) are incorrect.

Which leaves options C and D.

Now, for the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors of S (and hence A_y) are |+y> and |–y>, which are:

|+y> = 1/sqrt(2) [1, -i]^T

|–y> = 1/sqrt(2) [1, i]^T

Now, what about A²?

A² = (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2.

Each A_i is c σ_i, so A_i^2 = c² σ_i² = c² I, because σ_i^2 = I for any Pauli matrix.

So A² = c² (σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z^2) = c² (3I) = 3 c² I.

So any vector is an eigenvector of A² with eigenvalue 3 c². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct.

As for the second part, can the eigenfunctions of Ay also be eigenfunctions of Az? Let's think. Az is c σ_z. The eigenvectors of Az are |+z> and |–z>, which are [1,0]^T and [0,1]^T, normalized.

The eigenvectors of Ay are |+y> and |–y>, which are different from |+z> and |–z>. So the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az because [Ay, Az] = iħ (something), non-zero. So the second part of option C is correct.

Thus, option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( S \) (and hence \( A_y \)) are the eigenstates of the Y-component of angular momentum, \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \), which are orthogonal.
   - These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). 
     - \( A^2 = A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2 \). Since each \( A_i = c \cdot \sigma_i \) and \( \sigma_i^2 = I \), \( A^2 = 3c^2 I \). Thus, any state is an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \), making the first part correct.
     - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes the second part correct as well.
     - Therefore, Option C is correct.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, the wording is ambiguous. The operator \( A_y \) is represented in the standard basis, and its eigenfunctions are not necessarily the same as the standard basis. Thus, this statement is less precise and not necessarily correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the properties of the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) with respect to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
