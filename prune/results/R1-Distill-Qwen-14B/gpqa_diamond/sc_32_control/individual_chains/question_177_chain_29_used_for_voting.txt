Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me see what I remember about this.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, does mass matter here? Because I'm thinking that luminosity relates more to radius and temperature, not mass. Unless maybe it's a red giant or something, but I don't think so in this context.

Next, the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength for a black body, right? So according to Wien's Law, lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. If lambda is the same for both, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, T1 equals T2. That's important because the luminosity formula uses temperature.

The formula for luminosity I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Since both stars have the same temperature, T1 equals T2, so T cancels out in the ratio.

Now, let's think about their luminosities. L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, that becomes (R1/R2)². So R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1/L2 is 2.25. Wait, but why are the options including numbers around 2.23, 2.32, etc.?

Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again. Oh, wait! There's more information. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700. So perhaps this is about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths?

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So in the rest frame of each star, their peak wavelengths are the same, but when observed, due to Doppler shift, would that affect anything? Hmm, wait. Because the observed wavelength could be different if the star is moving towards or away from us. Oh, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Does that mean the observed wavelengths are the same, or the rest wavelengths are the same?

Wait, the problem statement says: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, the observed wavelength would be different than its rest wavelength. But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are same for both. So their rest wavelengths would be different because of their velocities? Hmm, maybe I need to factor in the Doppler effect.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me re-express this. The peak emission wavelength (lambda_max) for a black body is given by Wien's law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be different due to Doppler shift. But the question says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So for each star, their rest frame lambda_max is related to their actual T, but the observed lambda_max (what we measure) is the same for both.

Wait, okay, perhaps I should think about the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift formula relates the observed wavelength (lambda) to the rest wavelength (lambda_0) and the radial velocity (v). The formula is approximately lambda = lambda_0 * (1 + v/c), assuming v is much less than c. But wait, direction matters. If a star is moving towards us, v is negative, so the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, v is positive, so longer (red shift).

In this problem, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, the problem states that the observed lambda_max are the same for both stars. So the observed lambda_max is the same, but their rest lambda_max must be different because Star_2 is moving.

Wait, but let me think. If Star_2 is moving, then the observed lambda_max for Star_2 would be different from its rest lambda_max. So that would imply that when we observe both stars, their observed lambda_max is the same, but their actual (rest) lambda_max must be different.

Wait, but how does that tie into their temperatures? Because from the problem, I thought that the rest lambda_max for both stars are the same, but that can't be because their temperatures are the same. Wait, no, wait. Because if their rest lambda_max are the same, then their temperatures would be the same. But if one is moving, the observed lambda would change. Alternatively, perhaps their rest lambda_max differ because their temperatures are different, but the Doppler shift makes the observed lambda_max same.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to model it.

Let me denote:

For Star_1:

v1 = 0 km/s. So observed lambda_max1 = rest lambda_max1.

For Star_2:

v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so positive velocity, so observed lambda_max2 = rest lambda_max2 * (1 + v2/c) [approximation for small v].

And the problem states that observed lambda_max1 = observed lambda_max2.

So, lambda1_obs = lambda_rest1 = lambda1 (since v1=0)

lambda2_obs = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c) 

But lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T, so lambda_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Which implies,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

But wait, wait. Wait, let's think again. If Star_2 is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so lambda2_obs is longer. But the problem says both observed lambda_max are same. So if Star_1's lambda_rest is same as its observed, and Star_2's lambda_rest is shorter, but because it's moving away, the observed is longer. So the observed would match.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently.

Let me denote:

lambda1_obs = lambda_rest1 = lambda1.

lambda2_obs = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So, lambda1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But lambda_rest2 = b / T2.

Similarly, lambda_rest1 = b / T1.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c) 

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Which can be rearranged to T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Wait, that makes T1 less than T2 if v2 is positive. So Star_1 is cooler than Star_2 in rest frame.

But earlier, I thought that the rest lambda_max for both stars are same, but that's not the case. The observed lambda_max are same, but their rest lambda_max could be different because of Doppler shift.

So if T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c), then T1 is less than T2.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about the rest wavelengths. It just says that the observed are same. So their rest temperatures must differ based on their velocities.

Wait, but the problem states that when the astronomers looked at the stars, the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest were the same. So the observed lambda_max is same for both. So the stars' rest lambda_max would be different because of their velocities.

So, Luminosity depends on R squared times T^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 * T1^4) / (R2^2 * T2^4)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1^2 = (2.25) R2^2.

So the ratio becomes (2.25) * (T1^4)/(T2^4)

But from earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c)

So (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c)^4

Putting it all together, L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v2/c)^4]

Wait, but what is v2/c?

v2 is 700 km/s.

Hmm, c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s.

So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333...

Approximately 0.02333, or 2.333% of the speed of light.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.02333.

So (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ (1.02333)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

(1.02333)^2 = approx 1.02333 * 1.02333.

Compute 1.02333 * 1.02333:

Let me compute 1.02333 squared.

= (1 + 0.02333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.02333 + (0.02333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472.

Then, (1.02333)^4 = (1.0472)^2.

Compute 1.0472^2:

= (1 + 0.0472)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0472 + (0.0472)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0944 + 0.002228 ≈ 1.0966.

So (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ ~1.0966.

So (1/(1.0966)) ≈ 0.912.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.912 ≈ 2.052.

Wait, wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are ~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute (1.02333)^4 more accurately.

Let me do a step-by-step calculation.

1.02333 to the power of 4.

First, let's compute 1.02333^2:

1.02333 * 1.02333.

Compute 1 * 1.02333 = 1.02333.

0.02333 * 1.02333 ≈ 0.02388.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator-like approach.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.02333^2.

1.02333 × 1.02333

= (1 + 0.02333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.02333 + (0.02333)^2

= 1 + 0.04666 + (0.000544)

= 1.047204.

Then, 1.047204^2.

Compute:

1.047204 × 1.047204.

Let me do it step by step.

1.047204 × 1.047204.

Break it into (1 + 0.047204)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.047204 + (0.047204)^2.

= 1 + 0.094408 + 0.002228.

= 1.096636.

So 1.047204 squared is approximately 1.096636.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.096636.

Thus, 1 / (1.096636) ≈ 0.912.

So 2.25 * 0.912 = ?

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025; 2.25 * 0.012 = 0.027. So total 2.025 + 0.027 = 2.052.

Wait, that's about 2.05. But the options are higher than 2.2. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Doppler shift formula differently. Because the observed wavelength is longer for Star_2 (if it's moving away), but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So maybe the rest wavelengths are different, but the observed are same.

Wait, let's re-express the Doppler shift.

The general Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, that's the relativistic formula. But since v is much less than c, perhaps we can approximate it.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler effect for wavelength when the source is moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c). So for small v, this approximation holds.

But if the star is moving towards us, it's 1 - v/c. But since Star_1 is at rest, and Star_2 is moving away (v=700 km/s), the observed lambda for Star_2 is longer.

So the observed lambda_max for Star_2 is lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

The observed lambda_max for Star_1 is lambda_rest1.

But the problem says that these observed lambdas are the same. So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T. So,

lambda_rest1 = (b / T1)

lambda_rest2 = (b / T2)

Thus,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So T1 is less than T2.

But wait, the problem states that the luminosities are computed assuming the stars are black bodies. So when they compute L1 and L2, they're using their rest temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I was correct initially. So L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2 / R2^2 = (2.25).

And T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So T1^4 = T2^4 / (1 + v2/c)^4.

Putting it all together,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [T2^4 / ( (1 + v2/c)^4 T2^4 ) ] 

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, no. Because T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c), so T1^4 = T2^4 / (1 + v2/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * [ (T2^4) / ( (1 + v2/c)^4 T2^4 ) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

L1 is (R1^2 * T1^4) 

L2 is (R2^2 * T2^4)

So,

(L1/L2) = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4)

R1^2 / R2^2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = ( (T2/(1 + v2/c) )^4 ) / T2^4 

= (T2^4 / ( (1 + v2/c)^4 )) ) / T2^4 

= 1/( (1 + v2/c)^4 )

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v2/c)^4 ]

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because T1 is T2 / (1 + v2/c), so T1^4 is [T2/(1 +v2/c)]^4. So (T1^4)/(T2^4) = [T2^4/(1 + v2/c)^4 ] / T2^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/(1 + v2/c)^4 )

Which is the same as 2.25 divided by (1 + v2/c)^4.

Wait, but earlier I computed (1 + v2/c)^4 as approximately 1.0966. So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05. That's about 2.05, but the options don't have anything near 2.05. The options are all around 2.23-2.35.

Hmm. That suggests I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift formula is the other way around. Let me double-check the Doppler shift formula.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But that's the exact formula. For small v, this approximates to lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, but sometimes when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the formula is (1 + v/c). So if the star is moving away, v is positive, so lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c).

But in our case, Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer than its rest. Star_1 has no velocity, so observed is same as rest.

Since the observed lambda for both is same, we can write:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T. So,

lambda_rest1 = (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Which implies T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 is less than T2.

Alternatively, solving for T2, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Hmm, but when I plug this into the luminosity ratio, perhaps I should re-express L2 in terms of T1.

Wait, let's try that.

L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4

But T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

So,

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma (T1 (1 + v2/c))^4 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4

So,

L1 / L2 = [ R1^2 T1^4 ] / [ R2^2 * T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4 ]

The T1^4 terms cancel, so,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) / (1 + v2/c)^4 

Which is (2.25) / (1 + v2/c)^4

But earlier, (1 + v2/c) is 1 + 700/(3e5) ≈ 1.023333.

So (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So (2.25)/(1.0966) ≈ 2.052.

But the options are all around 2.2 or higher. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler formula. Let's think: If a star is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer, so lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its rest. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths of both are same. So for Star_1, lambda_obs = lambda_rest1. For Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_rest2*(1 + v/c). But lambda_obs is same for both, so lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2*(1 + v/c)

Which implies,

lambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 = (1 + v/c)

But lambda_rest is inversely proportional to T. So,

lambda_rest1 = b / T1

lambda_rest2 = b / T2

So,

(b/T1) / (b/T2) )= T2 / T1 = (1 + v/c)

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)

Wait, this is the same as before. So earlier calculation must be correct.

But then why the luminosity ratio is 2.05, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift direction. What if Star_2 is moving towards us? Then the observed wavelength would be shorter.

Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s.

Wait, radial velocity of 700 km/s could be either towards or away. The problem doesn't specify the direction, just the magnitude. So I assumed it's moving away, but perhaps it's moving towards us. That would change the calculation.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then the observed wavelength is shorter. So,

lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 - v/c) 

But the observed lambda for Star_1 is lambda_rest1. So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 - v/c)

So,

lambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 = (1 - v/c)

Which, as before,

lambda_rest1 = (b / T1 )

lambda_rest2 = (b / T2 )

So,

(T2 / T1 ) = (1 - v/c )

Thus,

T1 = T2 (1 - v/c )

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, v is positive, and (1 - v/c) would be less than 1. So T1 = T2 * (something less than 1), so T1 < T2.

But then, the luminosity ratio would be:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= (2.25) * [ (T1/T2)^4 ]

= 2.25 * [ (1 - v/c )^4 ]

So,

v is 700 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So,

(1 - v/c ) = 0.997666...

(1 - v/c )^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.997666^4.

Compute 0.997666^2 first.

0.997666 * 0.997666.

≈ (1 - 0.002334)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2

≈ 1 - 0.004668 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99533744.

Then, square that again.

(0.99533744)^2 ≈ ?

Again,

(1 - 0.00466256)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00466256) + (0.00466256)^2

≈ 1 - 0.00932512 + 0.00002175 ≈ 0.99069663.

So,

(1 - v/c )^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking back at the options:

Option D) ~2.23.

So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why did I get a different result when I assumed Star_2 was moving away versus moving towards? Because the direction affects the Doppler shift, which in turn affects the temperature relation, and thus the luminosity ratio.

So the key is that the radial velocity is 700 km/s, but the problem doesn't specify direction. So I have to consider whether moving towards or away would make the observed lambda same.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's possible that Star_2 is moving towards us, leading to a smaller T1 and thus a lower L1, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, let's think.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed lambda is shorter for Star_2. Star_1 is at rest, so its observed lambda is same as rest. So if both observed lambdas are same, then Star_2 must have a smaller rest lambda.

But wait, let me get back. So when Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed lambda is shorter than its rest. But the problem says that the observed lambda is same as Star_1's observed. So Star_1's observed lambda is same as its rest.

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 (1 - v/c )

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 (1 - v/c )

Thus,

lambda_rest1 < lambda_rest2.

Which implies T1 > T2, because lambda is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, no. Because if lambda_rest1 is smaller, then T1 is larger.

Because lambda_rest = b / T. So if lambda_rest1 is smaller than lambda_rest2, then T1 is larger than T2.

Wait, so when Star_2 is moving towards us (v is positive), then:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 (1 - v/c )

Since (1 - v/c ) is less than 1, lambda_rest1 < lambda_rest2.

Thus, T1 = b / lambda_rest1 = b/(lambda_rest2 (1 - v/c )) = (b / lambda_rest2 ) * (1/(1 - v/c )) = T2 * (1/(1 - v/c )).

So T1 = T2 (1/(1 - v/c )).

Which is T1 = T2 (1 + v/c + (v/c)^2 + ... ) approximately 1 + v/c for small v.

So T1 is larger than T2.

So, moving towards us, T1 is larger.

Then, the luminosity ratio would be:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (2.25) * (1/(1 - v/c ))^4.

Wait, no.

Wait, let me make it clear.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then:

lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 (1 - v/c )

But lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

Since lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 (1 - v/c )

Which gives,

lambda_rest1 = (1 - v/c ) lambda_rest2.

But since lambda_rest = b/T,

b/T1 = (1 - v/c ) (b/T2 )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 - v/c )

So,

T1 = T2 ( 1 + v/c + (v/c)^2 + ... ) ≈ T2 (1 + v/c )

So,

T1 is larger than T2.

Thus, for L1/L2:

= (R1^2 T1^4 )/(R2^2 T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (T1/T2)^4 

= 2.25 * (1/(1 - v/c ))^4

Because T1 = T2 / (1 - v/c )

Wait, no. Let me compute T1/T2.

From earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 - v/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1/(1 - v/c )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 - v/c )^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1 - v/c )^4 ]

v =700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s → v/c=700/3e5 = 0.002333.

So,

1 - v/c ≈ 0.997666.

(1 - v/c )^4 ≈ (0.997666)^4.

What's 0.997666^4?

Compute 0.997666^2 ≈ 0.99533.

Then, 0.99533^2 ≈ 0.99069.

So,

1/(0.99069) ≈ 1.00945.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00945 ≈ 2.27.

But the options don't have 2.27. The closest option is B) ~2.32 or C) ~2.35.

Wait, perhaps my approximation is too rough. Let me compute (1 - v/c )^4 more accurately.

v/c = 0.002333333.

Compute (1 - v/c ) = 0.9976666667.

Compute (0.9976666667)^4:

First, (0.9976666667)^2 ≈ 0.995337778.

Then, 0.995337778^2: Let's compute accurately.

0.995337778 * 0.995337778.

Multiply 0.995337778 by 0.995337778.

0.995337778 * 0.995337778 = ?

Let me compute:

= (1 - 0.004662222) * (1 - 0.004662222)

= 1 - 2*0.004662222 + (0.004662222)^2

= 1 - 0.009324444 + (0.00002174)

= 0.990675556.

So, (0.9976666667)^4 ≈ 0.990675556.

So,

1/(0.990675556) ≈ 1.00946.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00946 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00946 ≈ 2.2722.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.27, which is still not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.27 is closest to either B or D. But perhaps my calculation isn't precise enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the Doppler formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the exact Doppler shift formula, not the approximation.

The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

where beta = v/c.

But perhaps I should use this instead.

So,

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

In this case, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then beta is positive.

So,

lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Star_1 is at rest, so lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

And the problem states that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

Thus,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But beta = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) )

= lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) )

Compute (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99534.

So sqrt(0.99534) ≈ 0.99766.

So,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * 0.99766.

Thus,

lambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 = 0.99766.

Which implies,

T1 = T2 * (lambda_rest2 / lambda_rest1 ) = T2 / 0.99766 ≈ T2 * 1.00235.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 * 1.00235.

So,

T1/T2 ≈ 1.00235.

Now, compute L1/L2.

L1/L2 = ( R1^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1.00235)^4.

Compute (1.00235)^4.

Approximate:

(1.00235)^2 ≈ 1.00470.

(1.00470)^2 ≈ 1.00945.

So,

(1.00235)^4 ≈ 1.00945.

Thus,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00945 ≈ 2.272.

Again, about 2.27. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem didn't consider the direction of the velocity. But given that the radial velocity is 700 km/s, to get the observed wavelengths same, Star_2 must be moving towards us, because if it's moving away, the observed lambda would be longer, requiring a different relation.

Wait, but the other possibility is that I'm miscalculating the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't involve Doppler shift at all. But that can't be, because the observed lambda is given as same, which implies Doppler shift must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed peak wavelengths are same, which includes the Doppler effect. So when they say the stars appear brightest at same wavelength, that's what we observe. So their rest wavelengths must differ based on their velocities.

But I'm stuck between two possible scenarios: Star_2 moving towards us or away. But only the towards case gives a higher L1/L2 ratio close to 2.27, which is not an option. The option closest is B) ~2.32.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute (1.023333)^4 accurately.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I confused the direction. Let me get this straight.

If Star_2 is moving away, then:

lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v/c )

And lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

So, lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 (1 + v/c )

Thus,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

Which makes T1 less than T2.

Then,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (T1/T2)^4 ] = 2.25 * (1/(1 + v/c)^4 )

v/c = 0.00233333.

(1 + v/c )^4.

Compute it accurately.

(1.00233333)^4.

= (1.00233333)^2 * (1.00233333)^2.

First, compute (1.00233333)^2.

= 1 + 2(0.00233333) + (0.00233333)^2

= 1 + 0.00466666 + 0.000005444

= 1.0046721.

Now, square this result:

(1.0046721)^2.

= 1 + 2*(0.0046721) + (0.0046721)^2

≈ 1 + 0.0093442 + 0.00002182

≈ 1.009366.

So,

(1 + v/c )^4 ≈ 1.009366.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23. That's option D.

Wait, but that's when Star_2 is moving away. Because earlier, when considering Star_2 moving away, the L1/L2 ratio was 2.05, but that's under the assumption that the Doppler shift is (1 + v/c). However, when using the exact Doppler formula, which for small v is approximately the same, I get 2.23 when Star_2 is moving away.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda is longer, so lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 (1 + v/c ), but lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

Thus,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 (1 + v/c )

Which gives T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c ), so T1 < T2.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/(1 + v/c )^4 ) ≈ 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.228, which is about 2.23.

Which is option D.

Wait, but this doesn't align with what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, when Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, so lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 (1 + v/c ). For the observed lambdas to be same as Star_1's, lambda_rest1 must be less than lambda_rest2.

Because lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1, and lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 (1 + v/c ), and both lambdas are same.

Thus,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 (1 + v/c )

Which implies,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

Thus, T1 < T2.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) = 2.25 * (1/(1 + v/c )^4 )

Which is 2.25 / (1 + 4*(v/c) + ... )

Wait, but earlier when I computed (1 + v/c )^4, I get approximately 1.009366.

So, 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.228.

Which is option D.

That makes sense.

So, the correct answer is option D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature of the star. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Substituting this into the ratio:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning their observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are equal. Using Wien's law, the rest-frame peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star 1, \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \) since its radial velocity is \( 0 \, \text{km/s} \). For Star 2, \( \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2 / c) \), where \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) is the radial velocity and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) is the speed of light.

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2 / c)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T \):

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_2}{c}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2 / c}
\]

### Step 3: Substituting into the luminosity ratio
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{1}{1 + v_2 / c} \right)^4
\]

Thus, the luminosity ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{1 + v_2 / c} \right)^4
\]

### Step 4: Calculating \( v_2 / c \)
\[
v_2 / c = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} = 0.002333
\]

### Step 5: Approximating \( (1 + v_2 / c)^4 \)
Using the binomial expansion for small \( v_2 / c \):

\[
(1 + v_2 / c)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot (v_2 / c) + 6 \cdot (v_2 / c)^2 + 4 \cdot (v_2 / c)^3 + (v_2 / c)^4
\]

Substituting \( v_2 / c = 0.002333 \):

\[
(1 + v_2 / c)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + 6(0.002333)^2 + 4(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4
\]

\[
(1 + v_2 / c)^4 \approx 1 + 0.009332 + 0.000030 + 0.0000002 + 0.0000000001
\]

\[
(1 + v_2 / c)^4 \approx 1.009362
\]

### Step 6: Final calculation
Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.009362} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.99067 \approx 2.228
\]

### Step 7: Comparing with options
The closest option to \( 2.228 \) is:

**D) ~2.23**
