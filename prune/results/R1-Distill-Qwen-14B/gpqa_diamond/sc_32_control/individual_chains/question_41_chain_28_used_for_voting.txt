Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me read the question again. A light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium can change from the usual c/n. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here. Let me think.

I think this might involve the concept of relative velocity. So, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So I guess I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So the lab frame would perceive the light as moving at v_light plus v? Wait, no, because velocities don't just add up that way when you're dealing with light. Oh right, because the speed of light is a constant, but wait, that's in a vacuum. Here, the light is in the moving medium, so maybe it's different.

Wait, no, the problem states that the speed of light in the vacuum is c=1. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which is 1/n. But when the glass is moving, do we have to use some sort of velocity addition formula? Like the relativistic addition formula?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because the glass is moving at velocity v, which I assume is much less than c, so maybe non-relativistic velocities are okay here. But I'm not certain. Let me think.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. The glass is moving towards the observer at v. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, in classical mechanics, if you have a light source moving towards you at speed v, the light's speed isn't just c + v. Because that would exceed the speed of light, which is impossible. But in reality, in the lab frame, the light's speed remains c, according to special relativity. But wait, that's when the source is in a vacuum, right? Here, the light is passing through a moving medium.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the lab frame as S and the glass's rest frame as S'. In S', the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n (since c=1). The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame S, so the S' frame is moving at velocity v relative to S.

Wait, no. Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light is moving through the glass at speed 1/n relative to the glass. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be (1/n) + v? But that would be a problem if v is significant because the speed of light can't exceed c.

Wait, but the options don't have anything like c here. Or maybe this approach is wrong. Because maybe the speed doesn't just add linearly.

Another thought: when the medium is moving, the refractive index might change the way the light propagates. Or perhaps the effective speed of light in the lab frame is affected by the velocity of the medium.

Wait, I remember the formula for the speed of light in a moving medium. Oh right, in the context of the Doppler effect, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think there's a formula in special relativity for the velocity of light in a moving medium. Let me try to recall.

In a medium moving with velocity u relative to the lab frame, the speed of light in the lab frame is not simply c/n plus u. Instead, the speed of light in the medium is affected by the motion of the medium. So perhaps we can model it using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the relativistic velocity addition formula says that if an object is moving at velocity u in frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the same axis, then the velocity u' in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

Wait, but in this case, the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and in the medium's frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v (towards the observer) in the lab frame. The light is moving through the glass at speed v_light = 1/n in the glass's frame. So, to find the lab frame's perception, we can use the velocity addition formula.

In the glass's frame S', the light's velocity is u' = 1/n. The glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame S. So, applying the velocity addition formula to find the lab frame's measurement (u) of the light's speed.

The formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait, because S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, and in S', the light is moving at u' = 1/n.

Wait, but wait: in the glass's frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass is moving towards the lab. So for the lab frame, which is the rest frame, the light's speed is u, and the glass is moving at v towards the observer.

Wait, so let me plug in u' = 1/n and v is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is v. Then:

u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / c² ]

But since c=1, this simplifies to denominator 1 + v/(n) = (n + v)/n.

So numerator: (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator: (n + v)/n.

So u = [(1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v), which is what I just derived.

But wait, I thought the speed of light should be c=1. But according to this calculation, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v). Hmm, but this is only valid if v is much smaller than c, which it is, because the glass is moving at v, and v << c=1.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So according to this, the observed speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let's see what happens in some limits.

If v=0, the speed should be 1/n, which matches. If n=1, the speed is (1+v)/(1 +v)=1, which makes sense because the medium is vacuum, and moving at v, but light speed remains 1.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the glass is moving at v, and if n=1, the speed would be 1. That's correct.

Wait, but what if v is positive, meaning moving toward the observer? Let me think about another scenario. Suppose n=2 and v=0.5. Then the speed would be (1 + 2 *0.5)/(2 +0.5)= (2)/(2.5)= 0.8. Which is less than c=1, correct.

Alternatively, in the glass frame, the speed is 1/2. The glass is moving towards the observer at 0.5. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is (0.5 +0.5)/(1 + (0.5)(0.5)) )? Wait no, that's not the formula. No, I should use the velocity addition formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light. So when you apply the velocity addition, the formula would be u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ).

But u' in the S' (glass) frame is the speed of light, which is 1/n. So the formula holds.

So the conclusion is that the speed is (1 + n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the speed of light should always be c (1) in a vacuum regardless of the source's motion. But in this case, the light is moving through a moving medium. So maybe the speed can be different because it's not a vacuum.

So the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Light in the Glass's Rest Frame**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass and \( c = 1 \) in vacuum.

2. **Glass Moving in the Lab Frame**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame.

3. **Simplifying the Formula**: Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Verification of Limits**:
   - If \( v = 0 \), the speed reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct for light in a stationary medium.
   - If \( n = 1 \), the speed becomes \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), consistent with the speed of light in a vacuum.
   - For other values of \( n \) and \( v \), the derived formula remains valid and consistent with the relativistic framework.

5. **Conclusion**: The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
