Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what particles the boson X can decay into, kinematically speaking. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I think this describes an interaction between the boson X and some fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into. Remember, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the combined mass of the fermions must be less than the boson's mass. Also, the fermions must be allowed by conservation laws—like charge and other quantum numbers.

First, let's list the known fermions and their masses. I'll try to remember their approximate masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but with a lot of uncertainty, but for decay purposes, it's much lighter)
- Down quark (d): similar to u, maybe 0.005 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV (so much heavier than X's 6 GeV)

So the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. For it to decay into a pair of fermions f and f̄, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV. Let's see each possibility.

Looking at the options, let's see what each option includes.

Option A: b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, e+e−.

Wait, but the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV each. So two b's would sum to 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b̄ because 6 GeV isn't enough. So option A is not correct because it includes b b̄.

Hmm, so options that have b b̄ are probably incorrect, like A and D.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Let's check the masses. Each c quark is ~1.5 GeV, so two would be 3 GeV, which is under 6. So that's allowed. s quark is ~0.1 GeV each, so two would be 0.2 GeV, way under. u and d even lighter. The tau is 1.777 each, so two taus would be about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6. For leptons: muons are 0.1 each, two muons 0.2; electrons are negligible. So all these combinations are allowed.

Option C: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, mu, e. Wait, top quark is way too heavy—each is 173 GeV, so two tops would be 346 GeV, way above 6. So X can't decay into t t̄. So option C is out because it includes top.

Option D: includes b b̄, which we determined isn't allowed as 9 GeV is too much. So option D is wrong.

So the only option that doesn't include b b̄ or t t̄ is option B. Let me double-check.

Wait, does X decay into tau pairs? Tau is 1.777 GeV each, so 3.55 GeV total, which is under 6. Yes, that's allowed. What about charm quarks? 1.5 *2=3 GeV, which is fine. So in option B, all the decay channels are allowed.

Another point: the interaction term is given. The Lagrangian has (v + X(y)), implying that the interaction is Yukawa-like. The fermions involved are f and ψ_f. So, the interaction is proportional to λ f ψ̄ f (v + X) ψ_f. So, the fermions involved must be such that they can couple to X.

Wait, but X is a boson—what kind of boson is it? Since the interaction term is similar to Yukawa coupling (mass term plus interaction with X), X must be a scalar boson, probably a spin-0 particle. So, for scalar bosons, the decay into fermion pairs is possible via s-channel.

But regardless of the spin, the kinematic limit is what matters here. So the masses of the fermions must each be less than 3 GeV (since two fermions each can't have mass more than 3 GeV each for 6 GeV total).

Wait, another point: when considering fermion masses, for a pair, each must be less than half the X mass. So 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can pair with another same fermion (so as to have total mass <=6 GeV).

Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, so two can be produced. Bottom is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so can't form a pair. Similarly, top is too heavy for even a single quark.

So checking the options again.

Option B includes c c̄, which is allowed (each 1.5, sum 3 GeV). s s̄: each s is ~0.1 GeV, sum 0.2. u and d even lighter. Tau: each 1.777, sum 3.55. That's under 6. So that's allowed. The leptons (mu, e) are way under. So all the decay channels in B are allowed.

Option A includes b b̄, which is 9 GeV—can't happen. So A is wrong.

Option B doesn't include b b̄ or t t̄, so it's correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the combined mass of the fermions must be less than the boson's mass. Additionally, the fermions must be allowed by conservation laws and the interaction term provided.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy for \( X \))

2. **Kinematic Limit**:
   - The total mass of the fermion pair must be less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means each fermion must have a mass less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Decay Channels**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which requires a total mass of \( 9 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^{+} \tau^{-} \), \( \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \), and \( e^{+} e^{-} \). All these fermion pairs have combined masses less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), making this option correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which requires a total mass of \( 346 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden for the same reason as in Option A. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) are those listed in **Option B**, as all the fermion pairs in this option have combined masses less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
