Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. And it's mentioned that the pion is stationary. The rest masses are provided: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two values, likely the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta. That means the magnitude of their momenta should be the same but directions opposite, so their momenta vectors cancel each other out.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have really tiny (almost zero) mass. Oh wait, no, in this problem, the neutrino is probably considered as having negligible mass, but the problem gives only the rest masses for pion and muon. So I guess the neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the others, so it can be treated as massless? Or do I need to consider it? Hmm, the problem doesn't give a rest mass for the neutrino, so I'll assume it's treated as massless.

Wait, but in reality, neutrinos have some mass, but perhaps for this problem, we can ignore it. So let's go with that assumption.

So the pion is at rest, so the initial energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).

So the energy conservation equation would be:

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu

E_initial is the rest energy of the pion, so 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is (gamma * m_mu * c^2). But since we're dealing in units where c=1, it's just gamma * m_mu. Similarly, E_nu is just the kinetic energy of the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, no. Wait, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, because if m=0, then E = pc. But since the pion is at rest, and the muon and neutrino are moving in opposite directions, their momenta must be equal and opposite.

So let's denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's momentum as p_nu. Since they are in opposite directions, p = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, perhaps the magnitudes are the same, so |p| = |p_nu|.

So, from the momentum conservation, the total initial momentum is zero, so the sum of the final momenta must be zero. Hence, the vector sum of the muon's momentum and the neutrino's momentum is zero. So the muon's momentum is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, for the muon: p_mu = gamma * m_mu * v, and similarly, its energy is gamma * m_mu * c^2. But again, since we’re working in MeV and masses are given in MeV/c², perhaps we can use E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. But with c=1, E² = p² + m².

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu * c. But since c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

But wait, in the muon's case, E_mu² = p² + m_mu², and for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu.

But from momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu. Because the magnitudes are the same. So p_mu = p_nu. Let me write that down.

Let me denote p_mu = p, and p_nu = p (same magnitude, opposite direction, but since we're using magnitudes, it's the same. So E_nu = p.

So, E_mu² = p² + m_mu².

We also have energy conservation: E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_initial is 139.6 MeV.

So substituting E_mu and E_nu:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, that gives an equation in terms of p. Let me square both sides to solve for p, but that might get a bit messy.

Wait, let me denote sqrt(p² + 105.7²) as A. Then the equation is 139.6 = A + p.

But A is sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2). So,

A = 139.6 - p.

Then,

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Squaring both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expand the right-hand side: (139.6)^2 - 2*(139.6)*p + p^2.

So,

p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

The p^2 terms cancel out.

So,

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p.

Let me compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.

139.6^2: Let's compute 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: Let's compute 105^2 = 11025. (105.7)^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6*p.

Rearranging,

2*139.6*p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute the right-hand side: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6).

Compute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 is approximately 279.2*30=8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Hmm, that's less than 8315.67. So maybe 29.8?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 279.2 * 29.8 = 8376 - 279.2*(0.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Hmm, that's close to 8315.67.

So 279.2 * 29.8 = 8320.16, which is a bit larger than 8315.67.

So, let me compute how much less.

8320.16 - 8315.67 = 4.49.

So, 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So, 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784. So approximately 29.784.

Wait, actually, 279.2 * (29.8 - x) = 8315.67.

We have 29.8 gives 8320.16. So 8320.16 - 8315.67 = 4.49.

So, 279.2 * x = 4.49. So x = 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So, p ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, that's the p value. So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Let me compute 29.8 * 279.2.

29.8 * 279.2 = (30 - 0.2) * 279.2 = 30*279.2 - 0.2*279.2 = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16. Yes, right.

So, 8315.67 is 8320.16 minus 4.49, so 29.8 minus (4.49/279.2). Which is 29.8 - approx 0.016, so 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So, now, E_nu = p ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Then, E_mu = 139.6 - p ≈ 139.6 - 29.784 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

But wait, E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

So, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu*c². Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c²,

KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 MeV.

Wait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV.

And the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu = p ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but let me make sure. Since the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero, its energy is entirely kinetic. So its KE is 29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations, because I might have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: Let me compute the equation again.

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu² = p² + (105.7)^2.

E_nu = p.

So,

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p.

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p.

Square both sides:

p² + 105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p².

Simplify:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p.

Compute 139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6.

Let me compute 140*140 = 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So,

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2 is 11172.49, as before.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

So,

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So E_nu is p ≈ 29.784 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV.

E_mu = 139.6 - 29.784 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of muon, so KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7 = 4.116 ≈4.12 MeV.

So the muon's KE is approximately 4.12 MeV, and neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D) is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon, \( \mu^+ \), and a neutrino, \( \nu \), using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses of the pion and muon are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), respectively. The neutrino is assumed to have negligible rest mass.

### Energy Conservation
The total initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
Here, \( E_{\mu} \) is the total energy of the muon (rest energy plus kinetic energy), and \( E_{\nu} \) is the energy of the neutrino (all kinetic, since its rest mass is negligible).

### Momentum Conservation
Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]
Let \( p \) denote the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (equal to the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum). The energy of the neutrino is then:
\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu}^2.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\mu} = 139.6 - p \) (from energy conservation), we solve:
\[
(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 105.7^2.
\]
Substituting \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):
\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 11172.49.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, this is its kinetic energy.

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu} = 139.6 - p \approx 139.6 - 29.784 = 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
