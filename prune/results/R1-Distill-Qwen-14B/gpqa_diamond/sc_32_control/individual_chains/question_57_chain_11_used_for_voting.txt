Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives me phase shifts δ_o to δ_4 as 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. And the problem says to ignore the rest, so I guess we're only considering these five phase shifts. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here because the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momenta l. Each term involves spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ = 0 degrees. 

I remember that when θ is 0 degrees, the direction is along the incident beam. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l) * P_l(cosθ) ]

But wait, when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Oh, right, because the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) equal 1 for any l. So that simplifies things. Then, f(0) becomes:

f(0) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l) ]

Since we're only considering l from 0 to 4, each term is (2l+1) times e^{iδ_l} times sin δ_l.

Wait, but we're asked for the imaginary part of f(θ) along the incident direction. So Im(f(0)) would be the imaginary part of the sum.

Let me break this down. Each term in the sum contributes to the imaginary part. The exponential e^{iδ_l} can be written as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when multiplying by (2l+1) sin δ_l, perhaps we should look at each term's contribution.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The term is (2l+1) * e^{iδ} * sin δ. Let's expand that:

(2l+1) * (cos δ + i sin δ) * sin δ
= (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ]

So each term contributes a real part and an imaginary part. The total imaginary part of f(0) will be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term, multiplied by (1/k). But wait, what is k?

k is the wave number. Since the electrons are 50 MeV, we can find k using the relation E = (ℏ² k² )/(2m), right? But wait, for electrons, their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV/c². But wait, 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, so maybe we can use the relativistic expression. Alternatively, if it's non-relativistic, but 50 MeV is quite high, so perhaps relativistic.

Wait, but for high energies, the mass is negligible compared to the kinetic energy, so maybe k ≈ sqrt(2mE)/ℏ. Wait, no, because E is kinetic. Hmm, perhaps better to think of E as the total energy. Wait, for electrons, the relation between energy and momentum is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think. Since the question gives the energy as 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so m can be approximated as negligible. Then, E ≈ pc. So p = E/(c). Then, k = p/(ℏ). So, k = (E/(c)) / ℏ.

Wait, but E is in MeV, and ℏ in energy units is about 197.33 MeV·fm (since ℏc is about 197.33 MeV·fm). Hmm, maybe that's a better approach.

So let's compute k. E = 50 MeV. So p ≈ E/c because E >> m c². Thus, p = 50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / ℏ. Since ℏ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, but I'm working in MeV units, so ℏ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s is the same as 6.582 × 10^-25 * 1e9 MeV·s = 6.582e-16 MeV·s. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Alternatively, since we're dealing with k in units where ℏ=1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers, since the options are in fm. Let's see. The wave number k is given by k = p/(ℏ). Since p = E/c, and E is 50 MeV, but let's make sure the units are consistent.

Hmm, perhaps using natural units where c=1, and ℏ=1, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation k = sqrt(2mE)/ℏ. But wait, if E is much larger than the rest energy, then m is negligible, so k ≈ sqrt(2mE) / ℏ. But that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy in eV and use appropriate unit conversions. But perhaps there's a simpler approach. Let's see.

Wait, the problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is given by Im(f) = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) sin δ_l. Because earlier expansion: each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by 1. Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, when I expand each term as (2l +1) [cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ], the real part is (2l+1) cos δ sin δ, and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ. So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l. Therefore, the sum of these for l=0 to 4, multiplied by 1/k, gives the imaginary part of f(0).

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * [ (2*0+1) sin² δ0 + (2*1+1) sin² δ1 + (2*2+1) sin² δ2 + ... + (2*4+1) sin² δ4 ]

So I need to compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l, sum them all, then multiply by 1/k.

Now, let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0 +1)=1. δ0=90°, so sin(90)=1. So 1 * 1² =1.

l=1: 3. δ1=67°, sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, square is ~0.8473. 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2:5. δ2=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192, square≈0.6710. 5 * 0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7. δ3=30°, sin(30)=0.5, square is 0.25. 7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4:9. δ4=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495, square≈0.0506. 9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Now sum all these:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 +3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 +1.75=8.6469

8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023.

So the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, multiply this by 1/k. But what's k? Hmm. Let me compute k correctly.

k is the wave number, which is (p)/(ℏ). But p is the momentum. The energy E is 50 MeV. For non-relativistic particles, E = (p² (2m)) / (2ℏ²). But wait, the electron's rest mass is about 0.511 MeV/c², and 50 MeV is much larger, so we're in the ultra-relativistic regime. So E ≈ pc. Therefore, p = E/(c). 

But let's make sure about the units. Let's compute p in MeV/c. So p = 50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / (ℏ) → but we need to make the units work. Since ℏ is in units of MeV·fm (since 1 MeV·fm is ℏc, but wait, no: ℏc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So ℏ is (ℏc)/(c) = (197.33 MeV fm) / (c). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps better to express k in terms of E.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is given by k = (p c )/(ℏ c²) ) * c → wait, I'm getting stuck on units. Let me try another approach.

The momentum p is E/c, in units where c is in m/s, but perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1 and ℏ=1.

Wait, in natural units, c=1 and ℏ=1. Then, E = pc → p=E. So k = p / ℏ = E.

Wait, but in that case, k would have units of E, which is MeV. But we need k in inverse femtometers. Let me think. 

Alternatively, using the formula for k in terms of energy. For an electron, the Compton wavelength is about 2.426 ×10^-12 m, but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, maybe I can find another approach. Let's think about the relation between k and the energy. 

The de Broglie wavelength λ is h/(p), where h is Planck's constant. Using ℏ = h/(2π), so p = h/(λ) → but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps using the relation E = (ℏ k )^2 (2m) / (2) → but since E is way bigger than m c², the non-relativistic approach might not be accurate. Alternatively, in relativistic terms, E² = (pc )² + (m c² )^2 → so p = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 ) / c.

But when E is much larger than m c², p ≈ E/c. So for E = 50 MeV, m c² is about 0.511 MeV, so E >> m c², so p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Now, k = p / ℏ. So let's compute p in units of MeV/c, and then divide by ℏ in MeV·s (but wait, no, units need to make sense for k in inverse meters). Hmm, perhaps I should compute k in terms of 1/fm.

Wait, let's compute k numerically. The momentum p is 50 MeV/c. Planck's constant ℏ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. But wait, that's in GeV units, and our p is in MeV. So let's convert things.

1 GeV = 1e3 MeV. So ℏ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Wait, but p is in MeV/c. So k = p/(ℏ) → wait, but units don't match. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the units in terms of c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength λ is given by h/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426 ×10^-12 m. So 1/(k) would be λ, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of fm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this: in natural units where c=ℏ=1, then p is in units of MeV, and k is p. But then, how to convert k into 1/fm? Because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

Wait, perhaps another approach: 1 fm is 1e-15 m. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The Planck constant ℏ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s, which is 1.0545718e-34 kg·m²/s.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find k in terms of E.

Given E = 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. The rest mass energy of the electron is about 0.511 MeV. So since E >> m c², we can use the approximation p ≈ E / c.

But I'm not sure how to get p into units that can be divided by ℏ to give k in inverse femtometers.

Wait, perhaps I should use the following approach:

E (MeV) = (p c) (MeV) → so p (MeV/c) = E/(c^2) * (MeV/c^2) * c → Hmm, not making sense.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between k and E. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = p c. So p = E / c.

But k is p / ℏ → so k = (E / c) / ℏ.

So k = E/(c ℏ).

But E is in MeV, c in m/s, ℏ in J·s. Let me convert units.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E =50e6 *1.602e-19 J= 8.01e-14 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ℏ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = (8.01e-14 J) / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) )

Calculate denominator: 3e8 *1.0545718e-34 = 3.1637e-26.

So k = (8.01e-14) / (3.1637e-26) ) = approximately 2.532e12 m^-1.

Now, convert meters^-1 to fm^-1. Since 1 m = 1e15 fm, 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1. Wait, no: 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So 1 m^-1 = 1e15 fm^-1.

So k in fm^-1 is 2.532e12 m^-1 * 1e15 fm/m = 2.532e27 fm^-1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I must have made a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, no: 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 fm = 1e-15 m → so 1 m^-1 = 1e15 fm^-1. Because if you invert both sides, (1 m)^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 → 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

Wait, no. Let me think again: 1 m = 1e15 fm → divide both sides by m * fm: 1/(m * fm) = 1e15 / m². Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Let me compute the number of fm in a meter: 1 m =1e15 fm. So 1 m^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1. Oh wait, that makes sense. So 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So if k is 2.532e12 m^-1, then in fm^-1 it's 2.532e12 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.532e-3 fm^-1.

Wait, that seems very small. But let's proceed.

So k ≈ 2.532e-3 fm^-1.

Wait, but looking back, my calculation for k: I have E=50 MeV, which is 8.01e-14 J. Then, k=E/(cℏ) → 8.01e-14 J / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) = 8.01e-14 / (3.1637e-26) ≈ 2.532e12 m^-1.

Which converts to 2.532e12 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.532e-3 fm^-1.

So 1/k is approximately 1 / 2.532e-3 fm^-1 = 395 fm.

Wait, no: 1/k is in fm, because k is 1/fm. So 1/k = (fm).

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

k = E/(c ℏ) = [50 MeV] / (c ℏ).

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion earlier. Let me try another approach.

Let's use the fact that 1 fm = 1e-15 meters. So k in fm^-1 is (p in MeV/c ) * (1 fm) / (ℏ in MeV·fm).

Wait, because ℏ has units of MeV·fm (since ℏc ≈ 197 MeV·fm).

Wait, ℏ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, which is 6.582e-25 * 1e9 MeV·s = 6.582e-16 MeV·s. Hmm, but how to get ℏ in MeV·fm?

Since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So perhaps, ℏc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Because 197.33 MeV·fm is the value of ℏc in those units.

So, ℏ = (ℏc) / c → but I'm not sure.

Wait, if ℏc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, then ℏ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

But c is in fm/s? How?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relation that k = p/(ℏ). Since p = E/c, and E is in MeV, then p is in MeV/c.

So k = (E/c) / ℏ.

But ℏ in units of MeV·fm/(c) ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula for k in terms of the energy, based on the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ = ℏ/(m c). For an electron, m c²=0.511 MeV, so λ ≈ 2.426e-12 m = 2.426 fm.

But perhaps more importantly, the wave number k is related to the energy by k = (p c)/(ℏ c^2) * c → Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

k (in fm^-1) = (E (MeV)) * (1 fm) / (197.33 MeV·fm)

Because ℏc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So, k = E / (ℏc) → since ℏc is 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = E / (197.33 MeV·fm) * (fm^-1) → because E is in MeV.

So for E=50 MeV, k = 50 / 197.33 → approximately 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, that seems more reasonable. So k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Which means 1/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

Wait, but earlier calculation via unit conversion yielded 1/k ≈ 395 fm, which is way too large. So maybe the correct approach is the second one, using k ≈ E/(ℏc). Since ℏc is 197.33 MeV·fm, E=50 MeV → k=50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/k is approximately 3.95 fm.

But wait, let me double-check this formula. Since ℏc has units of MeV·fm, then E (MeV) divided by ℏc gives units of fm^-1. So yes, that makes sense.

So, if E is 50 MeV, then k=50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1. So 1/k ≈ 3.95 fm.

Wait, but earlier approach via unit conversion gave 1/k as about 395 fm. So which is correct?

I think the correct approach is using the formula k = E/(ℏc). Because that's a standard approach in particle physics. So I'll proceed with k=0.253 fm^-1, so 1/k≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but earlier calculation via natural units gave me k=2.53e-3 fm^-1, which would make 1/k about 395 fm. But that's a big discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier unit conversion approach. Because when I computed k as 2.53e-3 fm^-1, that would be 1/k ≈ 395 fm, which is way larger than 3.95 fm as per the second approach.

Hmm. Let me think again: the wave number k is p/(ℏ), where p is the momentum.

But in natural units where c=1 and ℏ=1, p=E, so k = E.

But when we're working in units where c is not 1, then p = E/c. So k = p/(ℏ) = E/(c ℏ).

So, substituting the numbers:

E =50 MeV.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ℏ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But since E is in MeV, which is 1e6 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E=50e6 eV=50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-14 J.

So, p = E / c = (8.01e-14 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 2.67e-22 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p/(ℏ) = (2.67e-22 kg·m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s) → 1 J·s is kg·m²/s² * s = kg·m²/s.

Wait, kg·m/s divided by kg·m²/s = 1/m. So k is 2.67e-22 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.53e12 m^-1.

Which is 2.53e12 m^-1. Now, to convert to fm^-1, note that 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So, 2.53e12 m^-1 = 2.53e12 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-3 fm^-1.

Which is 0.00253 fm^-1. So 1/k is 1/(0.00253 fm^-1) = 395.25 fm.

Hmm, this contradicts the earlier approach using k= E/(ℏc) → 50/197.33≈0.253 fm^-1.

So now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Because the two methods are giving very different results.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because ℏc is 197.33 MeV·fm. So when I use k = E/(ℏc) → for E=50 MeV, k=50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm^-1.

But according to the unit conversion method, it's 0.00253 fm^-1.

Wait, that's a big difference. So perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express k using the relation k = (p c) / (ℏ c^2) → No, let me think: p = E/(c) → k = p/(ℏ) → E/(c ℏ).

So in terms of energy and ℏc, E/(c ℏ) = E/(ℏ c) * (1/c^2) ?

Wait, perhaps I should express this in terms of ℏc.

Since ℏc = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, E is 50 MeV.

So k = E/(ℏ c) → but (E)/(ℏc) → 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) → 50 /197.33 fm^-1 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Ah, so that approach gives k=0.253 fm^-1.

But in the unit conversion approach, I get k=2.53e-3 fm^-1, which is 0.00253 fm^-1, which is way smaller.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use k = (p c)/(ℏ c^2) → that would be p/(ℏ c) → because p c is (E) / (c^2) * c = E/(c).

Wait, p c is (E/c^2) * c → E/(c).

So, p c = E/(c).

So, k = p/(ℏ) = (E/(c^2)) / ℏ → No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relativistic relation:

E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

But since E >> m c^2, p c ≈ E → p ≈ E/(c).

So, k = p/(ℏ) → E/(c ℏ).

So, k = E/(c ℏ).

But how to compute that.

But with E=50 MeV, c=3e8 m/s, ℏ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

E=50e6 eV =50e6 *1.6e-19 J=8e-14 J.

So,

k = (8e-14 J ) / (3e8 m/s * 1.05457e-34 J·s )

= 8e-14 / (3e8 * 1.05457e-34 ) 

= 8e-14 / (3.1637e-26 )

= approximately 2.53e12 m^-1 → as before.

Which is 2.53e12 m^-1 = 2.53e12 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-3 fm^-1.

But that gives k=0.00253 fm^-1, which seems way too small.

But when I use the other approach, k=50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using E in Joules, but perhaps I should have used E in MeV without converting to J.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since ℏc is 197.33 MeV·fm, then:

k= E (MeV) / (ℏ c ) → E=50 MeV → k=50 /197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Yes, this makes sense. So why is the other approach giving a different result?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Because when I convert E from MeV to Joules, I should have considered that ℏc is given in MeV·fm. So perhaps the correct approach is to avoid the unit conversion and use k = E / (ℏc) → which gives k =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So, I'll proceed with k=0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/k ≈3.95 fm.

Wait, but the sum we computed earlier was 9.1023.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum → 9.1023 * (1/k).

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the sum is 9.1023 and the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum.

Wait, no, the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So, 9.1023 * (1/k) → which is 9.1023 * 3.95 fm.

Wait, 9.1023 *3.95 → let me compute that.

9 * 3.95 =35.55

0.1023 *3.95≈0.4032

Total ≈35.953.

So approximately 35.95 fm.

But looking at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, none of these match 35.95 fm. So that can't be right.

Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck the sum.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1 → sin^2(90)=1 → 1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67) → sin(67)=~0.9205 → (0.9205)^2=~0.8473 → 3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55) → sin(55)=~0.8192 → (0.8192)^2≈0.671 → 5*0.671≈3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30) → sin(30)=0.5 → 0.25 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13) → sin(13)=~0.22495 → (0.22495)^2≈0.0506 →9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum=1 +2.5419=3.5419 → +3.355→6.8969 → +1.75=8.6469 →+0.4554=9.1023. Yes, that's correct.

So sum is 9.1023.

So then Im(f) = sum * (1/k) → 9.1023 * (1/k).

But wait, I thought 1/k is about 3.95 fm, but that gives Im(f) ≈9.1023 *3.95≈35.95 fm, which isn't among the options.

So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 1/k.

Let me recheck k.

If k=0.253 fm^-1, then 1/k=3.95 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute 1/k as 197.33 MeV·fm / 50 MeV → 197.33/50=3.9466 fm.

Ah! So 1/k = 3.9466 fm.

So Im(f) = sum * (1/k) →9.1023 *3.9466 → let me compute this.

Compute 9 *3.9466 =35.5194.

0.1023 *3.9466≈0.403.

Total≈35.5194 +0.403≈35.9224 fm.

Still about 35.9 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, the original formula for Im(f) is (1/k) * sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l. So I have that right.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot that in some conventions, the scattering amplitude is multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a factor I'm missing, like a factor of 2.

Wait, let me think again. The formula I used for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). But when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So that's correct.

So where's the mistake?

Wait, the options are in the hundreds of fm. The calculated Im(f) is about 35.9 fm. But the options are in the hundreds, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used 197.33 MeV·fm for ℏc. So 1/k would be (ℏc)/E → (197.33 MeV fm) / (50 MeV) )= 3.9466 fm.

Which is what I had earlier.

So, 9.1023 *3.9466 → about35.9 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the sum? Let me recheck:

l=0: 1 * 1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67) →3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5 * (0.8192)^2=5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum: 1+2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

Yes, correct.

So I'm not seeing where I'm going wrong. The calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, but no, the question says the imaginary part.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, some sources define the scattering amplitude as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, no, I think the standard formula is f(θ)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

So that should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question gives the phase shifts in degrees, but the formula uses radians. Oh! That's a possibility I hadn't considered.

Because in the formula, the phase shifts δ_l are in radians, but the problem gives them in degrees.

So I need to convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin^2 δ_l.

Ah, now that's a crucial point!

I completely forgot to convert degrees to radians. So all my previous calculations are wrong.

So let me redo the sum, converting each δ_l from degrees to radians.

Compute sin^2(δ_l) where δ_l is in radians.

Compute each term again:

l=0: δ0=90 degrees → π/2 radians.

sin(π/2)=1 → sin^2=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1: δ1=67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937) ≈ sin(67°)=0.9205 → sin^2≈0.8473 →3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

Same as before.

l=2: δ2=55 degrees → 0.95993 radians.

sin(0.95993)=0.8192 → sin^2=0.671 →5*0.671=3.355.

Same.

l=3: δ3=30 degrees → π/6=0.5236 radians.

sin(0.5236)=0.5 → sin^2=0.25 →7*0.25=1.75.

Same.

l=4: δ4=13 degrees → ≈0.22689 radians.

sin(0.22689)=0.22495 → same as before, 0.0506 →9*0.0506≈0.4554.

So the sum is still 9.1023.

Wait, so that doesn't change anything. Because the sine of the angle is the same whether in degrees or radians, as long as the input to the function is correct.

Wait, no—wait, no! Because when I compute sin(δ_l), if δ_l is in degrees, I should convert it to radians before computing the sine.

So in the previous calculation, I used degrees, which was wrong.

Wait, no—no, the problem gives the phase shifts in degrees, but when calculating the sine, I should convert each to radians first.

Wait, let me recompute the sines correctly.

Wait, for l=1, δ=67 degrees → in radians, 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

sin(1.16937) ≈0.9205 → same as before.

But let's compute sin(67 degrees) accurately.

Wait, sin(67°) is approximately 0.92050485345.

So, same as before.

So, no change in the sum.

Hmm, so this doesn't explain the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. I've seen another formula where the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ (sinδ_l) / (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ) ] P_l( cosθ ). Or perhaps f is expressed differently.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used e^{2iδ_l} instead.

Wait, let me think again. The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, maybe I got the exponential wrong. Because sometimes the formula uses e^{2iδ_l}.

Wait, let me check: the standard formula is:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part would involve sin(2δ_l) terms.

Wait, that would change everything. Because then, the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l ) * P_l(1) ].

When θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So the term is (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) × sin δ_l ] ?

Wait, no. Let me compute the imaginary part.

e^{i x} = cos x + i sin x.

So e^{2 i δ_l} sin δ_l = (cos 2δ_l + i sin 2δ_l) * sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is sin 2δ_l * sin δ_l.

So the total imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l sin 2δ_l.

Wait, that's different from before. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

If that's correct, then the sum becomes:

sum = Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l sin 2δ_l.

So let me recalculate the sum with this new approach.

Compute each term:

l=0: δ0=90°, sin(90)=1, sin(180)=0 → 1 *0=0.

l=1: δ1=67°. sin(67)≈0.9205, sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193 → 3 *0.9205 *0.7193 ≈3 *0.663 ≈1.989.

l=2: δ2=55°. sin(55)=0.8192, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 →5 *0.8192 *0.9397 ≈5 *0.771 ≈3.855.

l=3: δ3=30°. sin(30)=0.5, sin60=√3/2≈0.8660 →7 *0.5 *0.8660 ≈7 *0.433≈3.031.

l=4: δ4=13°. sin(13)=0.22495, sin(26)=0.4384 →9 *0.22495 *0.4384 ≈9 *0.0986≈0.887.

Now, summing these:

l=0:0.

l=1:1.989 → sum=1.989.

l=2:3.855 → sum=5.844.

l=3:3.031 → sum=8.875.

l=4:0.887 → sum=9.762.

So sum ≈9.762.

Now, 1/k is 3.9466 fm.

So Im(f)=9.762 *3.9466≈38.5 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is also incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, let me think again. The scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

The imaginary part is Im(f) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l * Im(e^{i δ_l}) → which is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l → (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier, giving 35.9 fm.

But options don't have that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, perhaps the actual value of ℏc is 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/k = ℏc / E → 197.33 /50 ≈3.9466 fm.

So, 9.1023 *3.9466≈35.9 fm.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. I found a source that says the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2 δ_l).

Which for our case, gives sum=9.762, leading to Im(f)=9.762 *3.9466≈38.5 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm. Are any of these close to 35.9, 38.5, etc.? No. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the error is that the phase shifts are given as δ_o, δ_1, ..., δ_4, but in reality, the phase shifts start at l=0. So perhaps I should include l=0 to 4, which I did.

Wait, perhaps the formula actually uses the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiplies by 1/k. So that would be sum =9.1023, and 1/k=3.9466 → 9.1023 *3.9466≈35.9 fm.

But that's not matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by 1/k.

Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, it's (2l+1) multiplied by sin δ_l, but perhaps the units are different. Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees, which I forgot to convert to radians when computing the sine.

So, let me recalculate the sum with the correct radians conversion.

Compute each term correctly, converting degrees to radians.

Compute each sin(δ_l):

l=0: 90 degrees → π/2 → sin=1.

l=1:67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians → sin≈0.9205.

l=2:55 degrees → 0.95993 radians → sin≈0.8192.

l=3:30 degrees → π/6 → sin=0.5.

l=4:13 degrees →0.22689 radians → sin≈0.22495.

So the sin^2 values are the same as before. So the sum remains 9.1023.

So, no change.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) times sin(2δ_l).

Wait, if the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), for l=0 to 4.

Let me compute that.

Compute each term:

l=0: sin(180)=0 → 1 *0=0.

l=1: sin(134)= sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193 →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: sin60=0.8660 →7 *0.866≈6.062.

l=4: sin(26)=0.4384 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Im(f)=16.864 *3.9466≈66.4 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) times 2 sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Because sin(2δ)=2 sin δ cos δ.

So sum would be sum (2l+1) * 2 sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Which is 2 * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0:2*1 * sin(90) cos(90)=0 →0.

l=1:3*2 * sin67 cos67 →6 *0.9205 *0.3830≈6 *0.3526≈2.1156.

l=2:5*2 * sin55 cos55 →10 *0.8192 *0.5736≈10 *0.470≈4.70.

l=3:7*2 *sin30 cos30 →14 *0.5 *0.8660≈14 *0.433≈6.062.

l=4:9*2 *sin13 cos13 →18 *0.22495 *0.9744≈18 *0.2193≈3.9474.

Sum:0 +2.1156=2.1156 +4.70=6.8156 +6.062=12.8776 +3.9474=16.825.

Im(f)=16.825 *3.9466≈66.3 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) times sin(δ_l) multiplied by (e^{i δ_l} -1 ).

Because another version of the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Because [e^{i δ_l} -1 ] = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1 → which has imaginary part sin δ_l.

So, Im(f) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, that would change the factor.

In that case, the sum is 9.1023, and 1/(2k) =3.9466 /2≈1.9733 fm.

So Im(f)=9.1023 *1.9733 ≈17.9 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) times tan δ_l.

Wait, because sometimes the scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of tan δ_l.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) times sin δ_l times something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the total cross-section, but the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, not multiplied by anything else, and then multiply by 1/k.

Which is what I did earlier, getting 35.9 fm.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think about the unit conversion again.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is in units of inverse meters, and I'm supposed to convert it to inverse femtometers.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, I found k=0.253 fm^-1. So 1/k=3.95 fm.

But perhaps the problem expects me to use k in units of inverse fm, and so 1/k=3.95 fm.

So Im(f) =9.1023 *3.95≈35.9 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option C) 177.675 fm, which is about 5 times larger than my result.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the sum. Because some sources define the scattering amplitude as f = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2δ_l).

Which for our data gives sum=9.762 as before.

So Im(f)=9.762 * 3.9466/2 →9.762 *1.9733≈19.3 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is different. Let me recompute k.

Wait, from E=50 MeV, what is k?

If E=50 MeV, and assuming it's non-relativistic, then k = sqrt(2mE)/(ℏ).

But for an electron, m=0.511 MeV/c².

So, k = sqrt(2 * m * E) / ℏ.

Wait, but E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV/c².

So,

k = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV) / ℏ.

But the units are a bit tricky. Let me compute this.

First, compute the numerator: sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 ) → sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV^(1/2).

But then, to get k in units of inverse fm, I need to relate MeV^(1/2) to inverse fm.

Hmm, perhaps using the relation that 1 fm = 0.19733 GeV^(-1) → because ℏc ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So, 1 fm ≈ (197.33 MeV )^(-1) → 1 fm^(-1) =197.33 MeV.

So, 7.15 MeV^(1/2) = 7.15 * (MeV)^1/2.

But I'm not sure how to convert that. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ℏ → but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relativistic formula:

E² = (pc )² + (m c² )² → p= sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 ) / c.

So p= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) / c ≈50 /c.

Thus, k = p/ℏ =50/(c ℏ).

But this brings me back to the earlier calculation, giving k=0.00253 fm^-1 → 1/k=395 fm.

Which would make Im(f)=9.1023 *395 ≈3586 fm.

Which is way higher than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the unit conversion. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(θ=0)) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives Im(f)=9.1023 * 3.9466 ≈35.9 fm.

But since the options don't include this, perhaps the question is using a different definition or I've made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in units where the scattering amplitude is multiplied by k. So perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which would give Im(f)=9.1023.

But the options are much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the units for the scattering amplitude are in terms of inverse femtometers, and the options are given in inverse femtometers, but I'm not considering the correct scaling.

Wait, the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m. So 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and 1 fm^-1 is 1e15 m^-1.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) gives a result in (fm)^-1, which when multiplied by 1/k (in fm) gives a result in fm.

Wait, in the formula, Im(f) is in (fm)^-1, since k is in fm^-1.

So, Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/k) → which would be sum (dimensionless) * (fm).

So, our sum is 9.1023, multiplied by (1/k)=3.9466 fm → gives 35.9 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 50 GeV, not MeV? No, the question says 50 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I've been using degrees. But no, earlier calculation showed that even when using radians, the sum didn't change.

Wait, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm.

Because 35.9 is approximately one-tenth of 359, but option B is 355.351, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a factor of 10 somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of 1/k is wrong by a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k. Let me recompute 1/k.

If E=50 MeV, and using ℏc=197.33 MeV·fm.

Then, k=E/(ℏc) →50/197.33≈0.253 fm^-1.

So 1/k=3.95 fm.

So, 9.1023 *3.9466 ≈35.9 fm.

But if instead, 1/k=395 fm, which would be the case if k=0.00253 fm^-1.

Then, 9.1023 *395 ≈3586 fm.

Which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, unless I made a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum again in a different way.

Wait, 9.1023 *3.9466.

Compute 9 *3.9466=35.5194.

0.1023 *3.9466≈0.403.

Total≈35.5194+0.403=35.922.

So, 35.9 fm.

But that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the actual formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without the square.

Wait, let's compute that.

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Im(f)=13.382 *3.9466≈52.7 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm.

Which is approximately 177.7 fm.

But how to get that.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 45.0, and 45 *3.9466≈177.597 fm.

Which is option C.

So perhaps the sum is 45.0.

Wait, how?

Let me think: Perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I didn't account for the conversion correctly.

Wait, let me compute the sum using radians correctly.

Compute each sin δ_l correctly, converting degrees to radians.

l=0:90deg →1.5708 rad → sin=1 →1.

l=1:67deg →1.16937 rad → sin=0.9205 →3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:55deg →0.95993 rad → sin=0.8192 →5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:30deg →0.5236 rad → sin=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:13deg →0.22689 rad → sin=0.22495 →9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Sum=1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

Which gives sum=13.382. So Im(f)=13.382 *3.9466≈52.7 fm.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 45.0, which would give Im(f)=45 *3.9466≈177.597 fm, option C.

So how to get a sum of 45.0?

Let me see:

If I use l=0 to l=4, what's the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, sum is 9.1023 as before.

But if I include higher l's beyond 4, but the question says to ignore the rest beyond l=4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using the sum of (2l+1) multiplied by sin δ_l, not squared.

Which gives sum=13.382.

Then, 13.382 *3.9466≈52.7 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that none of the options match, but the closest is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 45 *3.9466.

So perhaps the correct sum is 45, leading to Im(f)=177.675 fm.

But I don't see how to get a sum of 45.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way, or perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I should compute the sum using radians.

Wait, let me recompute the sum where each δ_l is in radians.

But no, the values are the same as before.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2 δ_l).

Which for our data, sum is9.762.

So Im(f)=9.762 *3.9466≈38.5 fm.

Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) tan δ_l.

In that case, sum would be sum (2l+1) tan δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0: tan(90) → infinity → but this is impossible, so perhaps this term is excluded.

Wait, no, because tan(90) is undefined.

So perhaps l=0 is not included. But the problem gives δ0=90°, so perhaps we should include it.

But tan(90) is infinity, which would make the sum infinite. That can't be right, so perhaps the formula doesn't include the l=0 term.

But the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4, implying that l=0 to 4 are included.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

But I can't see how to arrive at that number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum calculation.

Wait, perhaps the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is 45, leading to Im(f)=45 * 3.9466≈177.597 fm, which is option C.

So perhaps the sum is 45, which would require including more terms or different phase shifts.

But according to the given phase shifts, I can't see how to get a sum of 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the sum of (2l+1) to be 45, but that's not the case because the sum of (2l+1) from l=0 to 4 is 1+3+5+7+9=25.

So 25 * something=45 → something=1.8.

But I don't see where that would come from.

Given all this, I think I'm missing something, but I can't figure it out. Based on the calculations, the only possible conclusion is that the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option C, 177.675 fm.

The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic electron scattering at an energy of \( 50 \, \text{MeV} \), given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived as:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number \( k \):**  
   Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), the wave number is calculated as:
   \[
   k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
   \]
   Thus, \( 1/k \approx 3.95 \, \text{fm} \).

2. **Sum of Terms:**  
   The sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \) is computed for each \( l \):
   - \( l=0: (2(0)+1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
   - \( l=1: (2(1)+1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 2.5419 \)
   - \( l=2: (2(2)+1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 3.355 \)
   - \( l=3: (2(3)+1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 1.75 \)
   - \( l=4: (2(4)+1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 0.4554 \)

   Adding these terms gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023
   \]

3. **Imaginary Part of Scattering Amplitude:**  
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l = 9.1023 \cdot 3.95 \approx 35.9 \, \text{fm}
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options:**  
   The calculated value of \( 35.9 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \( C \) (\( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \)) is approximately \( 5 \times 35.9 \, \text{fm} \). This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the calculation or an issue with the provided options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the closest match to the expected result is option \( C \), which is approximately \( 5 \times \) the computed value. This discrepancy might arise from an unaccounted factor or an error in the problem setup.
