Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a sphere, and inside it, a smaller sphere-shaped hole that's not exactly at the center. Now, they put a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four expressions, A to D, each giving a formula for E. I remember that for conductors, charges reside on the surface, and the charges inside a cavity affect the conductor's surface charge but not the field outside. Oh wait, that's the method of images or something about the shell theorem.

Let me recall: The electric field inside a conductor is zero because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Charges in the cavity would induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor itself was initially uncharged, the inner surface would have an induced charge of -q (because the positive charge in the cavity attracts negative charges to the inner surface). But wait, the total charge of the conductor is zero, so the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So the induced charges must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the inner surface (inside the cavity) has a charge of -q, and the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the sum of the inner and outer surface charges gives the total charge of the conductor, which is zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q, sum to zero.

Wait, no, if the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then the outer surface must have +q to ensure that the net charge on the conductor is zero. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surface charges.

So, when considering a point outside the conductor, the electric field would be due to the outer surface charge. Because the inner charges (the -q and +q) would have their fields cancel outside the conductor. Wait, no. The inner surface has -q, the outer has +q, so the net effect outside would be as if all the charge is on the outer surface. Because the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, more accurately, for a point outside the conductor, the field is due to all the charge outside that point. No, wait, according to Gauss's law, for a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge is the sum of all the charges inside the conductor. So in this case, the conductor has the inner surface (-q) and outer surface (+q), so the total is zero? Wait, but that can't be right because the cavity isn't part of the conductor. The conductor's total charge is the sum of the inner and outer charges. Oh wait, the conductor is neutral, so inner (-q) and outer (+q) sum to zero, which is correct.

Wait no, that can't be right. The conductor is uncharged, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero. But the charge in the cavity is +q. So the inner surface must have -q (to cancel the field inside the conductor), and the outer surface must have +q, making the total charge on the conductor zero. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

Therefore, when considering a point outside the conductor, the electric field is as if the charge +q is located at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric, so the field outside is same as if all charge is at the center.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because the outer surface charge is +q, and the field outside the sphere is as if all charge is concentrated at the center.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²), which would make sense. But wait, there's another consideration: the position of the charge inside the cavity. Because the charge isn't at the center, but at a distance s from the center of the conductor, right? The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, does the position of the charge inside the cavity affect the external field? Because in my earlier reasoning, the external field depends only on the outer surface charge, which is +q, and the distribution is spherically symmetric. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the outer surface's charge distribution adjusts to maintain the symmetry, so the field outside would still be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, no. Because if the charge is off-center, the inner surface charge would redistribute to cancel the field within the conductor. But the outer surface charge would still end up being uniformly distributed because the conductor is neutral, but wait, no: if the conductor is neutral, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, but the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the symmetry. Wait, no, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the outer surface will have a uniform distribution, regardless of the charge inside the cavity as long as it's spherically symmetric.

Wait, no. The charge distribution on the outer surface depends on the external fields, but in this case, since there are no external charges besides those inside the cavity and the conductor itself, the outer surface's charge will distribute in a way that the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but if the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, could that affect the distribution of the outer surface charge? Hmm, no, because the conductor's interior is a Faraday cage. The field inside the conductor is zero, so any asymmetry in the inner charges would influence the surface charge, but the outer surface charge would adjust to make the external field look like a point charge at the center. Because the conductor's outer surface must produce a field that, when added to any internal fields, results in zero inside the conductor.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about it. The cavity has a charge +q, and the inner surface of the conductor has -q. The outer surface has +q. Now, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed because the conductor is neutral and isolated. So regardless of where the +q inside the cavity is placed, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform. Therefore, the external field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Looking at the options, option B matches this. But wait, some of the options involve l, theta, and s. So why are those variables given in the problem then? It seems like perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the point P's position relative to the cavity's center affects the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the cavity affects the field outside, but I thought the conductor's outer surface's charge is what determines the external field. But maybe in this setup, because the conductor isn't a perfect sphere, but has a cavity off-center, the outer charge distribution isn't uniform. Wait, no, the conductor is a sphere, so even if the cavity is off-center, the conductor remains a sphere, so the outer surface charge would distribute uniformly.

Wait, but in reality, if you have a charge inside a cavity that's not at the center, the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge that's not uniform. The inner charge distribution would mirror the charge inside the cavity, but the outer surface would still be uniform because there's symmetry about the conductor's center.

So, in that case, the external field would still only depend on the total outer charge and the distance from the center. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B is this. But wait, option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q / l². Hmm, l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, but the conductor's center is at a distance L from P. If the conductor is a sphere of radius R, and the point P is outside, so L > R. But the charge in the cavity is inside, so why would l matter?

Wait, unless I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge. So, regardless of where the +q is inside the cavity, the outer surface would adjust to make the field outside the same as if all the charge was at the center. So the field at P depends only on L, the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but what if the point P is not aligned along the same axis as the cavity? Because in the problem, the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the centers are separated by s, with angle theta. So l, s, and the distance L are related by the law of cosines: L² = l² + s² - 2 l s cos(theta). But wait, that's only if the point P is in the same plane as the centers and the line connecting the centers. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but if the conductor is a sphere, the field outside should be spherically symmetric. So even if the cavity is off-center, the external field should still depend only on the distance from the conductor's center. Because the outer surface charge is symmetric.

So, the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L², which is option B.

But wait, another possibility: Maybe the cavity's position and the point P's position relative to the cavity affect the field. But I don't think so because, outside the conductor, the field is determined by the outer surface's charge. The conductor's shape (like being a sphere) ensures that the outer field is symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the superposition of the field from the charge in the cavity and the induced charges. But wait, outside the conductor, the induced charges on the outer surface produce a field equivalent to a point charge at the center. The field from the inner charges (cavity's charge and inner induced charge) would cancel inside the conductor, but outside, it's only the outer induced charge that matters.

So, the answer is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field within the conductor). To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$. The outer surface charge distributes uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For points outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Since the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge $+q$ is concentrated at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at a point $P$ outside the conductor depends only on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

3. **Relevance of Variables**:  
   The problem introduces variables such as $l$ (distance from $P$ to the cavity's center), $s$ (distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity), and $\theta$ (angle between $l$ and $s$). However, these variables do not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the field is determined solely by the total outer surface charge and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The electric field at point $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]  
   This matches option **B**.
