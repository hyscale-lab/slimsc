Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.

Alright, let me read the problem again. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I should probably find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh wait, wait. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid before dilution are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, no, wait—wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. When we dilute to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles/volume, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So, yes, 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, when adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

Now, during the titration with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. But since NaOH is a strong base, it will react completely with the acetic acid, which is a weak acid.

First, I'll find the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol (from before). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach equivalence would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. Wait, but wait. No, wait. Let me think again. The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. So the total volume is 40 cm³. So the number of moles is 0.025 * 0.04 L? Wait, no, wait—no, wait. Wait, wait. No, prior step: after dilution, the solution is 0.025 M. So the moles in the diluted solution would be 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Oh, same as before because we diluted the same amount. So, during titration, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So to reach equivalence, we need to add 0.001 mol of NaOH. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But wait, the problem is asking about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. Wait, what's 25% of 10 cm³? That's 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³, the solution is 25% titrated. Alternatively, it's 25% of the way to equivalence.

So, to find pH at 25% titration. Let's think about the state of the solution. At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. So the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be useful here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is acetate and HA is acetic acid.

But first, let's calculate the concentrations. Let me think about the moles after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. Adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH: moles of NaOH added is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction: each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, after adding NaOH, what is the total volume? The initial solution was 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ makes it 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M. The concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.7325. But wait, wait. Let me compute it accurately. Wait, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is approx 4.733.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is -0.4771. So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256, about 4.26. Wait, but let me check the numbers more precisely.

Wait, let me compute the exact ratio. [A-] is 0.00025 mol, [HA] is 0.00075 mol. So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈4.256. So approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem is when 25% of the NaOH is added. So 25% of the volume needed for equivalence. So, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³, which is what I used. So that part is correct.

Now, the second part: what's the pH at equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

So, the concentration of acetate at equivalence is moles of acetate over total volume. At equivalence, all the 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been converted to acetate. The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, which is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

Now, the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.

Let me denote [CH3COO^-] as 0.02 M.

At equilibrium:

CH3COO^- → CH3COOH + OH^-
Initial: 0.02 M
Change: -x       +x        +x
Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since Kb is very small.

So, Kb ≈ x^2 / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

Solving for x:

x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52
Option B: 3.17;6.73
Option D:4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of these. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Kb or the concentration. Let me double-check.

Wait, the moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L), so 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

So for Kb =5.405e-10,

x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) =1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is ~1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) = 4.98. pH=14-4.98=9.02.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume. Let me think again. The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Then, at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. So total volume is 50 cm³. So 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong K value? Let me check. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Maybe I did the calculation correctly, but the options don't have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, another thought. At equivalence, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. The pH can be found using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So another way is to calculate the pH using the concentration and Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should make a more precise calculation of Kb and x.

Let me compute Kb more accurately.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. Let's compute 1/1.85.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405405, so 0.5405405e-9 = 5.405405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405405e-10.

So, let's compute x^2 = Kb * C =5.405405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

sqrt(1.081081e-11) = sqrt(1.081081) * 1e-5.5.

Wait, sqrt(1.081081)= approx 1.04. So yeah, 1.04e-5. So [OH-]=1.04e-5.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5) = log(1/1.04) + 5. Let me compute log(1.04)=0.0170, so log(1/1.04)= -0.0170. So pOH=5 -0.017=4.983.

pH=14 -4.983=9.017.

But the options don't have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the concentration. Let me consider that during the titration, the volumes are additive. So the total volume is 40 + V_NaOH. For equivalence, V_NaOH is 10 cm³, so 50 cm³ total. So 0.05 L. So the acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is in the approach. Another way: perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis more accurately, but given that Kb is 5.4e-10, which is small, the approximation holds.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that [A-] is 0.02 M is correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration part.

Wait, let me think again about the initial dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05*(20/40) = 0.025 M. That's correct.

So, for the 25% titration:

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075. Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH: 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075/0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

[A-] =0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 = 0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.3333)=4.733 + (-0.477)=4.256. So about 4.26.

So the first part is 4.26, and the second part is about 9.02, but the options don't have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the NaOH is 0.1 M, and when you add 2.5 cm³, the volume is 42.5 cm³. But maybe I should compute the actual concentrations more precisely.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the wrong formula for the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't simply acetate; maybe there's another factor.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So sodium acetate is the main component.

Hmm. Let me see the options again.

Option A says pH is 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. That 8.52 is lower than what I calculated, which was around 9.02. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence point using a more precise method. Let me recompute.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.4054e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me let x be the [OH^-] produced.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) ≈x^2 /0.02, since x is very small.

x^2 = Kb * 0.02 =5.4054e-10 *0.02=1.08108e-11.

x= sqrt(1.08108e-11)= approx 1.04e-5. As before.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=4.98. pH=14-4.98=9.02. So why isn't this matching any options?

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the Kb more accurately. Let me compute 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405405.

So Kb=5.405405e-10.

Hmm. So that seems correct.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption about the equivalence point is incorrect. Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the solution after equivalence isn't just acetate. Or perhaps I'm not considering activity coefficients? No, in school problems, we ignore that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the wrong volume for the equivalence point.

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M, so 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³.

So the total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm not considering the dilution correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So new concentration is 0.025 M, as before.

So moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol.

So when you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, you add 0.001 mol of NaOH, which neutralizes the 0.001 mol of acetic acid, giving 0.001 mol of acetate. So the solution is 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³ of solution. So 0.02 M acetate.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the student forgot that at equivalence, the solution is a buffer. No, no, because all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is just acetate in water.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using Kb correctly. Let me compute Kb again:

Ka=1.85e-5, so Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)= (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approx 0.5405e-9=5.405e-10. Correct.

So why the pH is not matching any options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the first part.

Wait, let me look at all the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option D:4.57;6.92.

Hmm. At 25% titration, I got pH 4.26, which matches option A. But the equivalence pH is about 9.02, which isn't in any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the volume at equivalence. Because when you titrate, you add the NaOH to the diluted solution. Wait, the diluted solution is 40 cm³, and the NaOH is being added. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 +10=50 cm³. Correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence contains both acetate and some residual NaOH. No, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So no excess OH- from NaOH.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the equivalence point but the midpoint, but no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point pH. Maybe I should not have used the Kb but the Ka. No, because at equivalence, the solution is a base, so Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH more accurately. Let me compute [OH-] more precisely.

Calculating x^2= Kb*C =5.405405e-10 *0.02=1.081081e-11.

x=sqrt(1.081081e-11)= sqrt(1.081081)*1e-5.5.

Wait, sqrt(1.081081)=1.04 (since 1.04^2=1.0816). So x=1.04e-5. So [OH-]=1.04e-5 M.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)= let me compute it more accurately.

Log(1.04e-5) is log(1.04) + log(1e-5) =0.0170 -5 =-4.983.

So pOH=4.983. pH=14-4.983=9.017.

So pH is about 9.02.

But the options don't offer that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, let me check all steps again.

Ah! Wait a minute. I think I see the mistake. Oh no! The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. But wait, no, because the initial solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So 0.05 * 0.02=0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. That's correct.

But wait, when you titrate, you are adding 25% of the NaOH needed for equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So that's correct.

Now, perhaps the mistake is in the 25% part. Let me think again: at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. But wait, no. The percentage is based on the volume of NaOH added relative to the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So correct.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Moles neutralized: 0.00025. So remaining HA is 0.00075 mol, acetate is 0.00025. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M. Ratio is 0.005882/0.017647=0.3333. So pH=pKa + log(0.3333)=4.733-0.477=4.256. So 4.26. Correct.

So the first part is correct. So the options with 4.26 as the first value are A and D.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So perhaps the equivalence point is 8.52. But according to my calculation, it's around 9.02.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the Ka or Kb value? Let me check.

Ka is given as 1.85x10^-5. So pKa is -log(1.85e-5)=4.733.

Hmm. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence point is not just sodium acetate but perhaps some other factors. No, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the problem statement, the solution is not 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 cm³ of water, but the other way around. No, the problem says we dilute 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So yes.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence point using the exact expression without approximations.

Let me set up the equation without the assumption that x is negligible.

The Kb expression:

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5.4054e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02. But let's see whether x is significant compared to 0.02.

x is about 1e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation holds.

So the previous calculation is correct. So the pH is about 9.02.

But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. The problem says "the resulting solution" after dilution is titrated. So perhaps the NaOH is being added to the diluted solution, but the diluted solution's volume is 40 cm³. Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way the NaOH is being added. No, I think that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is with the equivalence point calculation. Let me think: perhaps the solution at equivalence point isn't just sodium acetate, but perhaps it's a buffer because I'm using a strong base. No, because the NaOH is in excess beyond equivalence, but wait, no, wait. Wait, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so the solution is just acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the Kb using a different approach. Let me compute the pH at equivalence point with more precise steps.

So, for acetate ion:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Initial concentration: 0.02 M.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 -x, x, x.

Kb = x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.4054e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So:

x^2=5.4054e-10 *0.02=1.08108e-11.

x= sqrt(1.08108e-11)=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=4.983.

pH=14-4.983=9.017.

So about 9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the dilution during the titration. Wait, no, because the addition of NaOH changes the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, initial 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³, 0.001/0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. Let me consider the options again. The only option that has 4.26 as the first pH is option A, which says at equivalence point the pH is 8.52. But according to my calculation, it's about 9.02.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pH at equivalence is calculated differently. Let me think, wait, wait, wait! No, wait. No, the acetate comes from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. So when you have the acetate ion in solution, it's a weak base. So the pH should be above 7. So none of the options with a pH at equivalence under 7 could be correct. So the only options with pH over 7 at equivalence are options A and D.

So option A says 8.52, which is lower than my calculated 9.02. Option D says 6.92, which is below 7, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa ≈4.733.

Kw=1e-14, so Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10. Correct.

So, perhaps another error: perhaps I mixed up the moles. Let me think again about the equivalence point.

So, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So, moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Volume is 50 cm³, so concentration is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the volume is 50 mL, which is 0.05 L, so moles are 0.001, which is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the equivalence point but the halfway point. No, the equivalence point is where all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the pH at equivalence is being calculated using the Ka expression, which would be wrong. No, because the solution is basic, so Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact pH using the formula without approximations.

The equation is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.4054e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, the approximation holds, but let's plug in the numbers without it.

x²=5.4054e-10*(0.02 -x).

x² +5.4054e-10 x -1.08108e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=5.4054e-10, c= -1.08108e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.4054e-10)^2 +4*1*1.08108e-11.

= (2.921e-19) + (4.3243e-11) = approx 4.3243e-11.

sqrt(D)= ~6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.4054e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

Taking positive solution: (6.576e-6 -5.4054e-10)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 6.576e-6 is much larger than 5.4054e-10. So x≈(6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from before. So [OH-]=3.288e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6)=5.485.

pH=14-5.485=8.515.

Ah! So the pH is approximately 8.52. That matches option A for equivalence point.

Wait, but why is this different from the previous approximation? Oh, because in the first approach, I assumed x is negligible, but perhaps it's not. Wait, in the first approach, x was 1.04e-5. Which is 0.0104 mM. The initial concentration is 20 mM. So x is 0.05% of the initial concentration. So the assumption holds, but the more precise calculation gives x=3.288e-6, which is 0.03288 mM. So the initial assumption that x is negligible may not hold as well as I thought.

Wait, let me recompute the quadratic equation accurately.

The equation is:

x² + (5.4054e-10) x -1.08108e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -B ± sqrt(B² +4AC) ] / (2A), where A=1, B=5.4054e-10, C=-1.08108e-11.

Compute discriminant D: B² +4AC = (5.4054e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(-1.08108e-11).

Wait, no, wait: 4AC=4*1*(-1.08108e-11)= -4.3243e-11.

Wait, no, the equation is x² + Bx + C =0. So in this case, C is -1.08108e-11. So,

D= B² -4AC = (5.4054e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.08108e-11).

= (2.921e-19) + (4.3243e-11) = 4.3243e-11 + 2.921e-19 ≈4.3243e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.3243e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So,

x= [ -5.4054e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 = [6.5706e-6]/2=3.2853e-6.

So [OH-]=3.2853e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.2853e-6)=5.485 →pH=14-5.485=8.515≈8.52.

Ah, so the correct pH at equivalence is about 8.52. So that's matching option A.

Wait, but why did the initial approximation give a different result? Because when x is not negligible compared to 0.02, the approximation breaks down. But in this case, x is about 3.285e-6, which is 0.0164% of 0.02 M. So the approximation should still hold. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.285e-6 compared to 0.02. 3.285e-6 is 3.285e-6 / 0.02 = 1.6425e-4 →0.0164% of 0.02. So it's negligible. So why is the quadratic solution giving a different result? Because perhaps the initial assumption isn't accurate enough.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the quadratic equation. Let me recompute.

Equation: x² +5.4054e-10 x -1.08108e-11 =0.

Compute discriminant D= (5.4054e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.08108e-11) = ?

Wait, no, wait: the equation is x² + Bx + C =0. Here, C is -1.08108e-11. So,

D= B² -4AC = (5.4054e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.08108e-11).

= (2.921e-19) + (4.3243e-11) = 4.3243e-11 + 2.921e-19.

Which is approximately 4.3243e-11. So sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So,

x= [-5.4054e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Which is (6.576e-6 -5.4054e-10 ) /2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

So this suggests that the pH at equivalence is about 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but why did the initial approximation give a higher pH? Because in the initial approximation, I assumed x is negligible compared to 0.02, which may not be the case when x is of the same order of magnitude as 0.02. Wait, no, x is 3.288e-6 and 0.02 is 2e-2, so x is much smaller.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. But according to the quadratic solution, the pH is 8.52. So the correct option would be A: 4.26;8.52.

But wait, earlier when I approximated x=1.04e-5, I got [OH-]=1.04e-5, which would give a higher pH. But with the quadratic solution, it's 3.288e-6, which is lower, leading to a pH of 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check the Kb expression.

The Kb expression is correct: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

So, the quadratic approach is the correct method, giving pH around 8.52.

So, at 25% titration, pH is 4.26. At equivalence, pH is 8.52. So option A matches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH) diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a 40.00 cm³ solution with a concentration of 0.025 M. The solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, and we calculate the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: pH at 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added. The equivalence point requires neutralizing 0.001 mol of acetic acid (from 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid), which requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Thus, 25% titration corresponds to adding 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

- Moles of NaOH added:  
  \[
  0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of acetic acid remaining:  
  \[
  0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of acetate ion formed:  
  \[
  0.00025 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Total volume after adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}
  \]
- Concentrations:  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right)
  \]
  \[
  \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733
  \]
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256
  \]
Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### **Step 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate in a total volume of 50.00 cm³ (40.00 cm³ of diluted acetic acid + 10.00 cm³ of NaOH).

- Concentration of acetate:  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.020 \, \text{M}
  \]
- The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}
  \]
- The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
  \]
- Let the concentration of OH⁻ at equilibrium be \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] - x}
  \]
  Substituting \( K_b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \) and \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = 0.020 \):  
  \[
  x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.020) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}
  \]
  \[
  x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
  \]
- The concentration of OH⁻ is \( [\text{OH⁻}] = 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \). The pOH is:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485
  \]
- The pH is:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515
  \]
Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.
