Okay, so I've got this science question in front of me. It's about molecular biology, specifically dealing with ligands, receptors, and some genetic constructs. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The person created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors have two coding regions in one construct, each controlled by their own promoter or regulatory elements. Here, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Looking at the regulatory elements: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA stands for Cytomegalovirus-Bastion-Adeno, but more importantly, it's a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate transcript from the ligand, right? So the ligand and receptor are both expressed from the same vector but under different promoters.

Then there are these loxP and lox2272 cassettes with stop signals. The ligand has a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. I remember that Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can excise the DNA between them. So if Cre is present, it can delete the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed. But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so maybe the stops are used to prevent read-through from one gene to another.

They transfected the vector into primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. On Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin, meaning their loading control worked. So the construct is being expressed in the cells. But when they breed mice homozygous for the construct and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal under the microscope. The green would come from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor.

Wait, SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse where Cre is expressed under the control of SOX10, which is a gene active in neural crest cells. So the Cre would be active in those cells. The idea is that the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But why no green signal? The eGFP is on the receptor. So either the receptor isn't being expressed, or it's not getting to the cell surface, or maybe it's not being properly processed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about the expression in the same cells, as the vector is bicistronic. If they are paracrine, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, but I don't see how that would explain no green signal. Unless the ligand is not expressed, but the Western blot showed expression because the antibodies were against overexpressed proteins.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't be visible. But the construct has the receptor at the 3' end with IRES, which should allow proper processing. Also, if the eGFP is not present, perhaps the construct wasn't properly processed. But I'm not certain.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. If the enhancer is missing, maybe expression is low. But the Western blot showed signals, so the proteins are being expressed. Unless the enhancer is required for the proper expression in specific tissues, but the question says the proteins were expressed in astrocyte cultures.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the vector has the receptor ORF fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If the stop codon in the lox2272 cassette is not properly excised, then the eGFP might not be expressed or the receptor might not be correctly processed. Or maybe the fusion is in the wrong reading frame. Wait, if the stop isn't excised, the receptor would not be expressed. But the presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre) should excise the lox2272 cassettes, allowing the receptor to be expressed. If the Cre wasn't active, perhaps the stop remains. But in the question, the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design is such that the eGFP is after the stop, and without Cre, the stop is in place. When Cre is present, it deletes the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. So in the absence of Cre, the stop would prevent expression, but in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the ligand is under CBA promoter, followed by a stop with loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor, followed by a stop with lox2272. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed (because CBA is a strong constitutive promoter), but the receptor is not, because the IRES would allow its expression, but perhaps the lox2272 stop is in place, preventing eGFP from being expressed.

Wait, no. The IRES is between the ligand ORF and receptor ORF. Without Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, but the receptor is under the control of IRES. So ligand expression is driven by CBA, and receptor expression by IRES. But the receptor has a stop after it with lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

But when Cre is present, it deletes the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, allowing both stops to be removed. So ligand and receptor would be expressed. So in the mice crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, so the stops are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

So why no green signal? Because the eGFP isn't being expressed, which suggests the receptor-eGFP construct isn't being made. Hmm.

Wait, the vector is designed so that each gene is under a separate regulatory element. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. So the presence of Cre shouldn't affect the expression of the ligand, only the receptor.

Wait, but when Cre is present, it would excise the lox2272 stop in the receptor's cassette, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. So in the crossed mice, the Cre should have activated the expression of the receptor and eGFP.

But the mouse model they made is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the same construct. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous mouse, the Cre is active in the neural crest. So the Cre should recombine the lox2272 in the construct, allowing eGFP to be expressed. So in the offspring, in cells where Cre is active, the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

But they don't see a green signal, which is eGFP. Possible reasons: Maybe the eGFP is not being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait! The construct could be designed so that the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the loxP and lox2272 stops are correctly excised, the receptor would be expressed, but if the stop remains, the eGFP wouldn't be. Alternatively, perhaps the insertion of the stop cassettes disrupts the reading frame. Wait, the ligand ORF is 5' with a stop in loxP, and the receptor is 3' with stop in lox2272. But when the stops are excised, the ORFs would be correctly connected.

Wait a second, the vector is a bicistronic vector. The ligand is at 5' with its own promoter (CBA), then a stop in loxP. Then IRES, then receptor, then stop in lox2272. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is not because the stop is in place. With Cre, the stops are excised, so both ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, no. The IRES is after the ligand's ORF. So the ligand is expressed under CBA, then the IRES allows the receptor's ORF to be expressed as a separate transcript. But the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop with lox2272. So without Cre, the receptor's stop is in place, preventing eGFP expression. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the experiment, even after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem must be that the receptor and eGFP are not being expressed. Why?

Let me think about the vectors. Maybe the lox2272 is a different recombinase target. Oh, wait, loxP is recognized by Cre, but lox2272 is recognized by another recombinase, like Dre or something else. Oh wait, no. lox2272 is a variant of loxP that can be used with Cre, but perhaps with different efficiency. Oh, but in this case, the vector is set up with both loxP and lox2272 cassettes. Cre can only recognize loxP sites. So the lox2272 sites would not be excised by Cre.

Wait, no. I think lox2272 is a variant that can be used with Cre but is more efficiently excised. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think. Normally, loxP is recognized by Cre. lox2272 is a modified site that is also recognized by Cre, but perhaps requires a different Cre version or has a different efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the lox2272 stops are flanking the receptor and eGFP, and Cre can't excise them because it doesn't recognize the lox2272 sites.

Wait, that would be a problem. If the stop cassettes are in lox2272, and the Cre used can't recognize lox2272, then the stops wouldn't be excised. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But wait, the question says that the vector has a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette for the ligand, and a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette for the receptor. So, when Cre is introduced, it should only excise the ligand's stop because that's between loxP sites. The receptor's stop is between lox2272, which Cre may not recognize. Oh, wait, but I'm not sure. I thought that Cre can recognize lox2272 as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are different, and Cre can only cut loxP. So the ligand's stop is between loxP sites, and Cre can excise it, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop is between lox2272 sites, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor and eGFP are still under the stop, so they aren't expressed.

In that case, even after crossing with SOX10-Cre, the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Hence, no green signal.

So, if the Cre can't excise the lox2272 sites, the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the problem is that the lox2272 cassettes aren't being cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, which option points to this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would be the case if the stop wasn't excised, perhaps due to Cre not acting on the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains, and the construct is not in frame? Or perhaps the stop is present, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector design: the ligand is under CBA promoter, then a stop, then IRES, then receptor with a stop in lox2272. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is not. With Cre, the ligand's stop is excised (because it's in loxP), so ligand is expressed, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but only if the lox2272 stop is excised. If the Cre doesn't cut the lox2272, the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP.

If the vector has the receptor's ORF followed by a stop in lox2272, and Cre can't excise that, the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP doesn't get made.

Which option aligns with this? Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, no. If the stop remains, the receptor isn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is that the stop is still present because the Cre didn't excise it, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But none of the options directly say that.

Alternatively, the construct might be such that the stop is in the same reading frame as the receptor, preventing eGFP expression. If the stop isn't excised, the receptor would terminate early, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. Let me recheck the options.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. That implies that their coding sequences are not in the same reading frame, which would cause a frameshift and a nonfunctional protein. But how would that happen? If the loxP and lox2272 sites are correctly excised, the ORFs should be in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the vector was constructed caused a frameshift. But I don't think that's the case here.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. If the promoters are missing enhancers, expression might be low. But the question states that in the Western blot, the proteins were expressed, so the enhancers must be present.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, but that's a trafficking issue. How would the construct's design cause that? The eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor, so it should be correctly processed. Unless the stop is still present, making the receptor truncated and not functional.

Wait, without the stop being excised, the receptor's expression is blocked. So the issue is that the lox2272 stop isn't being excised by Cre. Therefore, the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP.

So why would the Cre not excise the lox2272 sites? Because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272 sequences. I thought that Cre can recognize lox2272, but perhaps in this setup, it doesn't. So the stop remains, and the receptor isn't expressed.

In that case, the problem is that the lox2272 stop isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't made, hence no green signal.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Hmm. Let me think again.

The question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. The only option that relates to the expression construct is option D, which is about the frame. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning, but the IRES is supposed to drive the receptor's expression.

Wait, another possibility: The lox2272 stop is flanked by lox2272 sites, but perhaps Cre is not active in the cells where the receptor needs to be expressed. But in this case, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should drive Cre expression in neural crest cells—so the Cre should be active there.

Alternatively, maybe the vector is designed such that only the ligand is expressed, and the receptor can't be expressed without another recombinase. But the question indicates that the vector is bicistronic, so both should be expressed when the stops are removed.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a lox-Cre vector. The ligand is at 5' with loxP-stop, and the receptor at 3' with lox2272-stop. When Cre is present, it excises the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. But if the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, only the ligand's stop is excised, leaving the receptor's stop in place. Thus, the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP.

Therefore, the reason for no eGFP is that the Cre can't excise the lox2272 sites, so the receptor's stop remains, preventing its expression.

But looking at the options, none of them mention anything about the Cre or the lox sites. So perhaps the answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, if the stop isn't excised, the receptor's ORF has a stop codon in the middle, making it nonfunctional. But the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either because the stop is before it. So the eGFP wouldn't even be made. So why would this happen?

Because the Cre doesn't act on the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the construct remains with the stop, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, but that would require a frameshift, which isn't the case here. The loxP and lox2272 are just stop cassettes; their excision doesn't affect the frame unless they disrupt the reading frame.

Wait, the ligand is 5' with mCherry, and the receptor is at 3' with eGFP. The stops are in the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. If the stops are not excised, the ligand is expressed (mCherry), but the receptor is not. So the eGFP isn't made.

So the absence of eGFP suggests that the receptor isn't being expressed. So the problem is that the lox2272 stop isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed such that only the ligand is expressed, and the receptor isn't, unless a second recombinase is present. But that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: The IRES allows expression of the receptor, but only if the lox2272 is excised. So if the stop isn't excised, the receptor isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop remains, but the options don't address that.

Hmm. I might be overcomplicating this. Let me consider each option.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. So it's about their function, not their expression. The question is about the expression in the same cell. If they're paracrine, ligand is secreted and acts on nearby cells. But the problem is about the expression in the same cell—neuro crest cells. So the eGFP not showing suggests the receptor isn't being expressed, regardless of their relationship.

Option B: Receptor stuck in Golgi. If that's the case, eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, but the Western blot should show the protein anyway. Since the question says the blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, perhaps the blot shows the presence (since the vector is transfected into astrocytes). But in the mice, they're looking for expression in neural crest cells. If the receptor is stuck in Golgi, you might not see surface expression, but the Western would show it. But the question says the blot is done on the transfected cells, which showed expression. The mouse model's Western wasn't done; it's visualization under the microscope.

Option C: Missing enhancer. The CBA promoter is strong, so without the enhancer, the ligand might not be expressed as much, but the question says the Western blot showed expression. So probably not the issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the reading frame is wrong, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein. But why would that happen? Because the stop isn't excised. If the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, then the receptor would have a premature stop codon, making it nonfunctional, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in this case, the eGFP is under the same stop, which isn't excised.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is on a separate reading frame, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the construct design includes the eGFP after the receptor. So without excision, the stop is in between, making the eGFP not expressed. So the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would this not happen? Because the Cre isn't active in the right cells, or because the lox2272 isn't recognized.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cre is unable to excise the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't have this as an option. So the only option that relates is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So perhaps the insert is such that the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, causing the receptor to be truncated and eGFP not expressed.

Wait, but without the stop, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the ligand and mCherry in frame, and the receptor and eGFP in another frame, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another approach. The fact that the ligand is under CBA suggests it's expressed, and the receptor under IRES. But the stop in the receptor's cassette isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Assuming Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, then the receptor's stop remains, so no eGFP. So the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre. But none of the options account for this.

Alternatively, the loxP and lox2272 sites are on the same chromosome, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, maybe the vector is such that the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, but the receptor under IRES requires the lox2272 stop to be excised. If Cre doesn't excise it, the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP.

But the options don't mention Cre or lox sites. So perhaps the answer is not any of the options, but the closest is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working. But IRES is supposed to drive expression of the downstream gene.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the lox2272 stop is in the same frame as the receptor, so when the stop is present, the receptor is truncated, and the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop isn't excised, the receptor is not expressed, so no eGFP.

But none of the options talk about the stop. So perhaps the correct answer is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, making option D the choice.

Wait, but in reality, if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in front of it, regardless of frame. So the absence of eGFP is due to the stop, not frame.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating, but perhaps the correct answer is D. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor, making it not expressed. But how would that happen? Only if the stop remains and the construct is in a different frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 flanks the eGFP, and when Cre is present, it deletes the eGFP as well. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a different reading frame, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in frame with the receptor.

But that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, the cre wasn't able to excise the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the lox2272 isn't getting cut.

But again, the options don't directly address this.

Wait, the initial vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand is 5', under CBA with a loxP-stop, and the receptor is 3' under IRES with a lox2272-stop. So with Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed, and the receptor's stop is removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed.

But if the lox2272 isn't cut, the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the offspring, because SOX10-Cre is active, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor wouldn't. But in the question, they don't see the green signal, which is the receptor's eGFP.

But the options don't directly address why the receptor isn't expressed.

In the absence of a direct option, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed so that the eGFP is under a different promoter, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: The ligand is under CBA promoter, and the receptor under IRES. SOX10-Cre is active, so the lox2272 should be cut, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But perhaps the mouse's construct is homozygous, and the Cre is only hemizygous. Maybe the presence of two copies of the construct (homozygous) makes the Cre less effective? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 cassettes are in the wrong orientation, preventing Cre from excising them.

But again, the options don't address that.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. The most likely reason for no eGFP is that the stop isn't being excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. If the Cre isn't working on the lox2272 sites, the stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Looking at the options, the only one that fits is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that doesn't seem to directly explain it.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 stop isn't correctly flanking the receptor and eGFP. For example, the stop is in the same frame, so when the stop is present, the receptor is truncated, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But without knowing the exact vector design, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't correctly positioned, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says the vector is designed with IRES, which should work.

Given that, I think the most plausible answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: lox2272 is a site that requires the Cre variant called "Dre" to cut, but I'm not sure. No, Cre can cut lox2272. I think lox2272 is a variant that allows directional recombination, but Cre can still recognize it.

So perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites are present, but Cre isn't active in the right cells. But the question says that the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre which is active in neural crest cells.

So it's possible that the vector's design is faulty, such that the lox2272 site isn't correctly placed, preventing Cre from cutting. Therefore, the stop remains, and the receptor isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, but since none of the options mention this, I have to pick the best possible choice.

Given the options, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm not entirely certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The ligand ORF contains a stop cassette flanked by loxP sites, while the receptor ORF contains a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. After crossing mice homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is expressed under the strong CBA promoter, while the receptor is expressed via the IRES element.  
   - The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.  
   - Cre recombinase is expected to excise these stop cassettes, allowing expression of the ligand and receptor.

2. **SOX10-Cre Activation**:  
   - SOX10-Cre mice express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.  
   - Cre should excise the loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes, enabling expression of both the ligand and receptor.

3. **Observation**:  
   - No green signal (eGFP) is observed, indicating that the receptor-eGFP construct is not being expressed.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **(A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**:  
     This option pertains to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor, not their expression. The question focuses on why eGFP is not expressed, so this is irrelevant.  
   - **(B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**:  
     If the receptor-eGFP were trafficking improperly, it would still be detectable via Western blot. The question states that the blot showed actin-normalized signals, indicating proper expression in transfected cells. This does not explain the absence of eGFP in the mouse model.  
   - **(C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**:  
     The CBA promoter is strong and constitutive, and the Western blot confirmed expression in transfected cells. This suggests that enhancers are not the issue.  
   - **(D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**:  
     If the stop cassette is not excised, the receptor would terminate prematurely, and eGFP would not be expressed. The absence of Cre-mediated excision of the lox2272 stop cassette could leave the receptor and eGFP in a configuration where they are not properly translated, aligning with this option.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame due to the failure of Cre to excise the lox2272 stop cassette. This prevents proper translation of the receptor and eGFP, leading to their absence in the offspring.

ANSWER: D
