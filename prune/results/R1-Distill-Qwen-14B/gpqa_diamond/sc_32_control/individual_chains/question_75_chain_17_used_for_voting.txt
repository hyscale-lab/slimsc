Okay, so I've got this question here about a genetic engineering problem that someone is facing while creating a transgenic mouse model. The main issue is that they can't overexpress the GADD45G protein as expected. Hmm, I need to figure out what went wrong by looking at the provided DNA sequence.

Let me start by understanding the setup. The person is trying to create a transgenic mouse where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed in an inducible manner. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. Then, they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't being overexpressed.

Looking at the DNA sequence they provided, I should check for any issues that would prevent proper translation. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. I'll scan through the sequence to see if there are any in-frame stop codons that might cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA. Let me go through the sequence in triplets to look for these. Starting from the beginning:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCAGGATGCA...

Wait, let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me see:

Looking at the first few codons:
ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG ...

Wait, in the middle, there's "TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG..." So the TTA is a codon for Phe (since TTA is phenylalanine?), but I'm looking for stop codons. Let me check each triplet:

Looking again:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG ...

Wait, TAC is Tyrosine, CCA is Proline, TAC is Tyr again, GAT is Asp, GGT is Gly, TCA is Ser, GAA is Glu, TTA is Phe, CGC is Arg, CAA is Gln, ATG is Met, ACT is Thr, CTG is Leu, GAA is Glu, GAA is Glu, TCC is Ser, GCC is Ala, GGC is Gly, CAG is Gln, GAC is Asp, ACA is Thr, GTT is Val, CCG is Pro, GAA is Glu, AGC is Ser, ACG is Thr. Hmm, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA here.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each triplet:

1: ATG (start)
2: TAC
3: CCA
4: TAC
5: GAT
6: GGT
7: TCA
8: GAA
9: TTA (Phe)
10: CGC
11: CAA
12: ATG (Met)
13: ACT
14: CTG
15: GAA
16: GAA
17: TCC
18: GCC
19: GGC
20: CAG
21: GAC
22: ACA
23: GTT
24: CCG
25: GAA
26: AGC
27: ACG
... and it continues.

Wait, looking further down the sequence:

Looking at the end of the sequence:

...CTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Breaking it into triplets from the end:

... GAG TGA

So the last few triplets are TGA. Wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the DNA sequence ends with CGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA.

Wait, wait, but wait: DNA is read as mRNA in the same direction, but the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T instead of U. So if the DNA has a TGA in the coding strand, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

So the last part of the DNA sequence is ...CGAGTGA, which would translate to CGA G TGA. Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. The DNA is written as the plus strand, which is the same as the coding strand. So when transcribed into mRNA, it would be complementary, so the mRNA would be ...CGA GUA... wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the DNA sequence is 5' to 3' as given. The coding strand is the same as the mRNA, except T becomes U. So the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand. Wait, no, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA.

Wait, no, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA because mRNA is synthesized using the template (non-coding) strand. So the coding strand has the same sequence as mRNA, replacing T with U.

So looking at the last part:

5' ... CGAGTGA 3'

So the mRNA would be ...CGA GUA...

Wait, no, because the mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary to the coding strand. So the coding strand is as given, and the template is complementary.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me explain: The coding strand is the same as the mRNA, replacing T with U. So the DNA sequence provided is the coding strand (since it starts with ATG, the start codon). So the mRNA would be identical to this DNA sequence, except with U instead of T.

So in the DNA, the sequence ends with ...CGAGTGA. So the mRNA ends with ...CGAGUGA (since T becomes U)? Wait, no. Wait, the DNA sequence is coding strand, so the mRNA would be the same, with T â†’ U substitution. So the last few nucleotides of the DNA are GAGTGA.

Wait, no, the DNA is 5' ... GAGTGA 3'. So the mRNA would be 5' ... GAGU GA ... because DNA is read as coding, so mRNA is same as DNA but T to U.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the entire DNA sequence and see if any triplet is a stop codon.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the HA tag is being placed correctly. The HA tag is from the N-terminus, so the first codon after ATG should be the HA tag. Wait, HA is a small peptide derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. Its sequence is usually YPYDHHHHH, where the H's are the tag. But in the DNA, the first codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc. So the HA tag would be at the beginning.

Wait, but if the HA tag is correctly added, the problem must be elsewhere. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA is mutated, leading to incorrect amino acids. But that would affect the antibody's ability to recognize the tag, but not necessarily prevent expression.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the sequence before the actual end.

C) The lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So perhaps without a linker, the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation. But the question is about not being able to overexpress, which could be due to the protein not being made, or being made but degraded.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon and all organisms have tRNA that recognize these. Moreover, the question is about the coding sequence.

Wait, looking back. The last triplet in the DNA is TGA. Let me see the DNA sequence:

The last few nucleotides are ...GCGGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Breaking that into triplets from the end:

...GAG TGA

So the last codon is TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. Oh! So the DNA construct ends with a TGA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to stop early, right?

Wait, but wait, the DNA is the coding strand. So the mRNA is the same as the coding DNA, but with U replacing T. So the mRNA would have ...UGA.

So the mRNA would have a UGA codon, which is a stop. That would cause the ribosome to terminate early. Therefore, the HA tag and the rest of the GADD45G would not be fully translated; the protein would be truncated at that point.

So the person's construct has a stop codon in the coding sequence, likely due to the HA tag addition or the way the construct was designed. So the ribosome is terminating early, leading to no full-length protein being expressed, which explains why overexpression isn't happening.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. If the DNA has a TGA at the end, that's a stop codon. But if that's the intended end, why is it a problem? Oh, wait, because the construct was supposed to have the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. So the presence of a stop codon in the middle (or at the end) would certainly cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, the TGA is at the very end. So the mRNA would end with UGA, which is a stop. So the ribosome would terminate, producing a truncated protein. So the person expected to have the HA tag followed by the full GADD45G protein, but instead, the protein stops at the UGA, making it much shorter. So the antibody against HA would bind, but the rest of the protein isn't there. So the overexpression wouldn't happen because the protein isn't being made beyond that point.

Therefore, the problem is that the construct includes a stop codon in the coding sequence, causing early termination. So the correct answer is B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The provided DNA sequence is the coding strand of the construct, which includes an N-terminal HA tag and the GADD45G coding sequence. The issue lies in the sequence itself.

Key observations:

1. **Stop Codon Identification**: The DNA sequence ends with the triplet `TGA` (positions near the end of the sequence). Since the coding strand is identical to the mRNA (with T replaced by U), this corresponds to the mRNA codon `UGA`, which is a stop codon. This stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized.

2. **Impact on Translation**: The presence of this stop codon means that the ribosome will halt translation early, resulting in a truncated protein. This explains why the full-length GADD45G protein, including the HA tag, is not being overexpressed as intended.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A) Missense mutation in the HA tag**: While a mutation in the HA tag could affect antibody recognition, it would not prevent protein expression entirely. This is not the cause of the issue.
   - **B) Ribosome terminated early**: The stop codon (`TGA/UGA`) in the sequence directly causes premature termination of translation, aligning with the observed lack of overexpression.
   - **C) Proteolysis due to lack of linker**: While proteolysis could degrade the protein, the question specifies that the protein is not being overexpressed, which points to a problem with synthesis, not degradation.
   - **D) Lack of tRNA for UAA**: UAA is another stop codon, but the sequence contains UGA, not UAA. Additionally, all organisms have tRNAs for stop codons to terminate translation.

The most likely cause of the issue is the premature termination of translation due to the stop codon (`UGA`) in the coding sequence.
