Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The options are four different formulas. I need to think through this step by step.

First, the IR spectrum shows peaks indicating an ester group. Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700 cm^-1. So, the compound must have an ester functional group. Esters are typically R-O-C-O-R, or more accurately, they're derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols. So, the structure probably has an ester somewhere attached to the aromatic ring.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals total. Let's break down each part:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Wait, a di-substituted benzene would normally have two sets of aromatic protons if the substituents are in positions that cause symmetry. For example, in para-substitution, the aromatic protons would split into two sets. But wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. If the aromatic ring is di-substituted with two groups in the meta positions or para, the aromatic Hs would show certain patterns.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe it's para-substituted. Because in ortho substitution, you might have more splitting, while para would give two sets of equivalent Hs. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the ring has two different types of Hs, like maybe two substituents in positions that cause two distinct sets.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. The splitting can tell us about neighboring protons. A doublet suggests each H is next to one other H, maybe in a trans configuration. Or perhaps in a structure like CH2=CHCOOR, but wait, in this case, it's vinyl Hs, so maybe in a group like CH2=CH- attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, the ester group would come from something like an acyl group attached to an oxygen, like O-CO-O-R or something. Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps the substituent on the aromatic ring is an ester group.

Let me think about the structure. So, the aromatic ring has two substituents. One of them is an ester group, maybe O-CO-O-R? No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R', so the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-alkyl.

So, substituents on the ring: let's say one is an ester group, and the other substituent... Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of another substituent. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is another group, like a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. So, maybe there's a vinyl group attached, perhaps as part of an ester substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an acetyloxy group (like OAc) and another group with a vinyl. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the NMR again: two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets suggests that a proton is next to another set of protons, perhaps two neighboring Hs. Or maybe each vinyl H is coupled with two others.

Wait, a doublet of quartets would imply each H is split by two neighboring Hs. For example, in a structure like CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a CH group, but then the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester. For example, if one substituent is an ester group with a vinyl, like maybe an allyl ester.

Wait, if the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have vinyl Hs. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but wait, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group, such as O-CO-OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-O (no, that doesn't seem right). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituents.

Wait, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is ester group, perhaps as O-CO-O-R. The other substituent could be a vinyl group, like CH2-CH2 attached to the ring? But then what about the NMR signals.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So there are two sets of methyl groups. So, two different methyl environments. For example, maybe one methyl is attached to an oxygen (like in an ester) and another methyl is a regular CH3 group attached elsewhere.

Wait, but if the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, perhaps the ester is something like O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) and the other substituent is a vinyl group.

Wait, but then the vinyl group would have two Hs. So maybe the substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and another group which has a vinyl, perhaps a methylene group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like the aromatic ring with two ester substituents, but that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a nitro group and the other is an ester. But the NMR doesn't show any signals for NO2, so probably not.

Wait, let me try to count the protons. The total signals: 6. But wait, the aromatic ring has 6 Hs in total, but in a di-substituted benzene, it's split into two signals (assuming para substitution). So, two signals for aromatic-H, each integrating as 2 H each.

Then, two vinyl-H signals: perhaps each integrates as 1 H each. Or maybe one is 2 H and the other is 2 H. But in the question, each is a separate signal, so maybe they're distinct. For example, in a trans configuration, each vinyl H is a doublet.

Wait, but the vinyl Hs are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. So maybe one is a trans coupling (doublet) and the other is adjacent to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group attached to the ring, like CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-O-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the other is a vinyl group attached to another part of the molecule.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So perhaps one is from the ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH3 would have a CH3, but that's a single methyl group), but in that case, it would be a triplet or something else. Wait, O-CO-OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as a triplet, but the problem states that the -CH3 signals are two separate signals. So perhaps the ester is something else, like O-CO-OCH(CH3)2, which would have a single CH3 as a singlet. Or maybe there are two different -CH3 groups elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a methyl group and another substituent with a different methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the ester structure. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So R could be an aryl group, and R' is an alkyl.

Wait, but the substituent on the aromatic ring would be O-CO-R', so that would be like a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen, which is attached to the ring.

So, substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which would have a CH2CH3 group. Then, the other substituent is something else, perhaps a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl Hs. So if the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2 attached to the ring, but that's not possible because CH2=CH2 is ethylene, which isn't possible as a substituent on a benzene ring (it would be like a phenyl group attached to ethylene, but that's not likely). Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent like CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R attached to the ring. Then, the vinyl Hs would be the CH2=CH- part.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyloxy group: O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-R. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl substituent on the R' side. For example, R' could be CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a vinyl. Alternatively, R' is CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again. Two vinyl Hs: one is a doublet (each H is next to one other H), the other is a doublet of quartets (each H is next to two Hs). So perhaps the vinyl group is CH2=CH- something. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-O-R attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl ether group (O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-O-R?), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: let's consider the number of protons in each environment.

The aromatic protons: two signals, so perhaps 2 protons each, so total 4 aromatic Hs. Wait, but benzene has 6 Hs. Wait, no, di-substituted benzene has two substituents, so the number of Hs depends on substitution pattern.

Wait, if the substituents are para, then there are two sets of equivalent Hs, each with 2 Hs. So the NMR would show two signals, each integrating to 2 H.

If the substituents are meta, then there are two sets of Hs, each integrating to 2 H as well? Or perhaps some other split.

Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho, then there's a more complex splitting, but the question says two signals, so perhaps para substitution.

So, aromatic Hs: 2 signals, each 2 H.

Vinyl Hs: two signals. Let's say each signal corresponds to 2 H. So, 4 H in total from vinyl groups.

CH3 groups: two signals, each perhaps 3 H. So 6 H in total from CH3.

Wait, but wait, the aromatic ring has 6 H. If it's para-disubstituted, 2 substituents each in para positions, so the ring has 4 H left, split into two sets of 2 each. So that's 4 H accounted for. Then, the other Hs: vinyl (4) and CH3 (6) → 4+6=10. Total Hs would be 4 (aromatic) +4 (vinyl) +6 (CH3) =14 H.

Wait, but let's check the possible formulas:

Options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

If the molecule has 14 H, then the formula should be C11H14O2 (option A) or C12H14O2 (option B).

Wait, but let's calculate degrees of unsaturation to check.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X=0, N=0.

So for each option:

A) C11H14O2: (2*11 +2 -14 -0)/2 → (24-14)/2 = 10/2=5.

B) C12H14O2: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 → (26-14)=12 → 6.

C) C12H12O2: (26-12)=14 → 7.

D) C11H12O2: (24-12)=12 →6.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring, which has 4 degrees of unsaturation (benzene ring). Plus, an ester group (which has a double bond in the carbonyl). So that's 5. Any other double bonds would add more. For example, vinyl groups would have a double bond.

Looking at the NMR, the presence of vinyl Hs suggests another double bond. So, one more degree of unsaturation: benzene (4) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) → total 6.

So the formula should have 6 degrees of unsaturation.

Options:

A) 5 → no.

B) 6 → yes.

C)7 → no.

D)6 → yes.

So options B and D have 6 degrees.

Now, let's think about the structure. The aromatic ring (4), ester (1), and vinyl (1). So 6.

Now, the formula needs to account for all these. Let's think about the molecular formula.

Ester group is O-CO-O-R. So, each ester brings in O2 and adds to the formula.

In the NMR, the CH3 groups are two different types. So, perhaps two methyl groups, each in different environments.

So, let's think about the substituents on the benzene. One substituent is an ester group, O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps attached to another part.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group attached via another part, like an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzene with an ester substituent (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group attached via an ether linkage. For example, O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-O-R, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenoate ester attached to the benzene. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate group, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyloxy group. For example, O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-O-R. No, that doesn't have a vinyl either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyloxy ester, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents:

1. One substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). So that would contribute O2, and the ethyl group has 2 carbons, so adding 2 C and 5 H (since ethyl ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which is 2 C, 5 H).

2. The other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps as an ethenyl group attached via an oxygen. For example, O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then the O would be in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring, like a benzene with a -CH2-CH2-O-CO-O-R group. But that would have the CH2-CH2 as single bonds, not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2. Then, the substituent would be an ester group with a vinyl in the R group.

In that case, the structure would be benzene with an ester substituent (O-CO-O-R, where R is CH2CH=CH2). Then, the R group is an allyl group.

So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2. So, the structure would be O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the vinyl Hs would come from the CH2=CH- part of the substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Let's think about the structure: the substituent is an allyl ester group. The structure would be O-CO-OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2..., no, wait, the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH=CH2. Wait, but the ester is O-CO-O-R, so R is CH2CH=CH2.

In that structure, the vinyl group is CH=CH2. So, the Hs on the CH2 would be split into a doublet and a quartet. Wait, but the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the structure is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 attached to the benzene.

In that case, the vinyl protons are on the CH=CH2 group. The CH2 group would have two Hs, and the CH would have two Hs (but wait, the structure is CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No. Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is an allyl ester.

In that structure, the substituent’s vinyl group would have two sets of Hs: the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl and the CH2 at the end.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O, but that doesn't have a vinyl.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 C, 14 H.

B) C12H14O2 → 12 C, 14 H.

C) C12H12O2 → 12 C, 12 H.

D) C11H12O2 → 11 C, 12 H.

We know that the molecule has an aromatic ring (6 C), an ester group (which would be O-CO-O-R, so R contributes some C and H), and a vinyl group.

So, let's count the carbons.

Assume the aromatic ring is benzene (6 C).

Ester group: O-CO-O-R. So, R has (n) C. The ester contributes 2 O, but the formula already accounts for that.

The substituent R in the ester would contribute (n) C. For example, if R is CH3, it's 1 C. If R is CH2CH3, it's 2 C.

Additionally, the other substituent on the benzene is a vinyl group, perhaps something like CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. Or, if it's a vinyl group attached via an oxygen, like O-CH2-CH2, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, if it's a vinyl group attached directly, like CH2=CH- attached, but that's a substituent with 2 C.

Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a methyl group, but that would contribute 1 C.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, R could be CH2CH3 (ethyl, 2 C) and another CH3 elsewhere.

Wait, let's try a structure where the benzene has two substituents: one is an ethyl ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the other is a methyl group. Then, the molecular formula would be:

Benzene: 6 C.

Ester group: O-CO-OCH2CH3 → contributes 2 C (from CH2CH3), so 6 + 2 =8 C.

Methyl group: 1 C → total 9 C. But that doesn't match any of the options, which have 11, 12 C.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Let's say the ester is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), which contributes 3 C. Then, the other substituent is a vinyl group, which is 2 C.

So, benzene (6 C) + ester R (3 C) + vinyl substituent (2 C) → 6 +3 +2=11 C. That would fit option A (C11) or D (C11).

But let's see the H count.

Ester R: O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 → CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H (but wait, CH2CH2CH3 is actually 2 CH2 groups and a CH3. So, 2*2 +3 =7 H in that substituent.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. Wait, but that would have 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H, but the vinyl is CH2=CH-, which is 2 H on the CH2 and 2 H on the CH in the vinyl group? No, wait, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2, but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, benzene-CH2-CH2-O-CO-O-R? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-O-R. Then, the vinyl group would contribute 2 C and 4 H (the CH2 and CH each have 2 H).

Wait, but perhaps the structure is benzene with two substituents: O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 and CH2=CH2. Wait, but CH2=CH2 is ethylene, which can't be directly attached as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. So, the R group is CH2CH=CH2. So, the substituent is an allyl ester.

In this case, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, R is CH2CH=CH2, which contributes 3 C and 5 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH=CH2 has 3 H; but wait, the structure is CH2-CH=CH2. So, the CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 2 H, and the CH2 has 2 H, but in a double bond, each CH has one H. So, perhaps the substituent's R group is CH2CH=CH2, which has 2 H on the first CH2, 1 H on the CH, and 1 H on the CH2. No, wait, structure is CH2-CH=CH2: the middle CH has two Hs (since it's a double bond? No, in a double bond, each C has only one H each. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2 for single bonds, but with a double bond, it's CH2-CH=CH2, so the central CH has one H, and the end CH2 has two H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe another approach: the molecular formula.

If the structure is benzene (6 C) with two substituents: one ester group (O-CO-O-R) and one vinyl group.

Assume the ester R is CH2CH3 (ethyl), which adds 2 C and 5 H (since ethyl has 5 H? Wait, ethyl is CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H. But the molecular formula would add 2 C and 5 H.

The vinyl group is perhaps CH2=CH2, but that's two C and 4 H. But that's not possible as a substituent. So, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-O-R, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group attached as an ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, R is CH2-CH=CH2, which is 3 C and 5 H.

So, the benzene (6 C) + ester R (3 C) + vinyl group (but wait, the R is already including the vinyl). Alternatively, perhaps the benzene has two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-O-R), and the other is a methyl group (CH3).

So, R would be, say, CH2CH3 (2 C) and the methyl is 1 C. So total C: 6 + 2 +1=9 C. Not matching any options.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to calculate based on the molecular formulas and the number of H.

Looking again: the NMR shows 6 signals in total. Let's think about the integration.

Assuming aromatic Hs are 4 (two signals, each 2 H), vinyl Hs are 4 (two signals, each 2 H), and CH3 groups are 6 H (two signals, each 3 H). So total H is 4 +4 +6=14 H. So the formula should have 14 H.

Looking at the options, options A (C11H14O2) and B (C12H14O2) have 14 H.

So, the possible formulas are A or B.

Now, which one has more carbons? Let's see: the benzene (6 C) plus substituents.

If the structure includes an ester group and a vinyl group, perhaps the substituent R in the ester is longer.

Assume the substituents are:

1. O-CO-O-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester) → adds 2 C and 5 H.

2. A vinyl group attached as CH2=CH- → adds 2 C and 4 H.

So total C: 6 +2 +2=10 C. But this doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, substituents are:

1. O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester) → 3 C, 6 H.

2. CH3 group → 1 C, 3 H.

Total C:6+3+1=10 C. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl ester). That would contribute 3 C (from isopropyl) and 6 H (each CH3 has 3 H, but it's a single substituent, so perhaps 6 H from two CH3 groups).

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so perhaps two different CH3 groups.

Another possibility: the substituent R is a methyl group, and another substituent is a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), and the other substituent is a methyl group.

So, benzene (6 C) + ester R (3 C) + methyl (1 C) → 10 C. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2OCH3, but that may complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene where one substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen, such as O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester), which would be 4 C.

Then, the benzene is 6 C, ester R is 4 C, and another substituent? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So another substituent could be a CH3 group.

So, 6 +4 (ester) +1 (CH3) =11 C → formula would be C11H... Let's calculate H.

Ester R: butyl → CH2CH2CH2CH3 → 4 C, 9 H.

CH3 substituent →3 H.

Benzene has 4 H (two signals, each 2 H).

Vinyl group: perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached, but wait, if the other substituent is a methyl group, then where is the vinyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Another approach: the number of carbons in the ester group and other substituents.

If the formula is C12H14O2 (option B), then the ester R contributes 12 -6 (benzene) =6 C.

So, R would be 6 C. So, R could be a pentyl group (5 C) plus something. But that's getting too long.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a benzoyl ester. For example, benzene with an ester group and another substituent that brings more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with an ester substituent where R is a phenyl group, but that would add more C.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond, contributing to the vinyl Hs.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, R is CH2-CH=CH2, which is 3 C and 5 H.

Then, the benzene has two substituents: O-CO-O-R (3 C) and perhaps another substituent, which could be a methyl group.

Wait, but that would make the total C as 6 +3 +1=10, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent R is a cyclopropane or something, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ring with two ester groups, but that would mean the formula has more O atoms, which doesn't fit the given options (O2 only).

Hmm. Maybe I should just count the molecular formula based on the information.

Total H:14.

So, the formula is either A (C11H14O2) or B (C12H14O2).

Now, which one of these would have the structure described.

Assuming the substituents are O-CO-O-R and another group that brings more C.

If the ester R is something like CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl), which is 4 C and 9 H.

Wait, but benzene (6 C), R (4 C) → 10 C. Then, another substituent would be a CH3, making 11 C. That would fit option A.

So, substituents:

1. O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester) → contributes 4 C and 9 H.

2. CH3 → contributes 1 C and 3 H.

Benzene →6 C, 4 H (two substituents in para positions, so two signals each 2 H).

Vinyl Hs: but wait, where are the vinyl Hs coming from? Because the substituents don't seem to include any vinyl groups. So maybe this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group attached as an ester. For example, O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, R is CH2-CH=CH2, which is 3 C and 5 H.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 → 3 C.

Substituent 2: perhaps a methyl group →1 C.

Total C:6+3+1=10 → but the formula options don't have C10.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct answer being option B (C12H14O2), because the ester substituent would have more C.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula.

Assume the structure is:

Benzene (6 C) with two substituents:

1. O-CO-O-(CH2)2-CH3 → this is a propyl ester. So R is CH2CH2CH3 → 3 C, 7 H.

2. Another substituent: perhaps a vinyl group attached via an oxygen as O-CH2-CH2-O-CO-O-R. Wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl ester), which is 3 C and 5 H.

So, substituent 1: 3 C.

Substituent 2: perhaps a methyl group →1 C.

Total C:6+3+1=10 → not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is a cyclopropane ring, but that's probably not the case.

Another approach: the molecular formula options.

Option B: C12H14O2.

So, 12 C.

Benzene (6 C) + substituents: 6 more C.

So substituents must contribute 6 C.

Each substituent would be 3 C each, perhaps.

One substituent is O-CO-O-R. R could be a propyl group (3 C). So, substituent 1: 3 C.

Substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group attached as CH2=CH- → but that's 2 C.

Wait, 3 +2=5 C, which doesn't reach 6.

Hmm. Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a methyl group →1 C. So 3+1=4; 6 (benzene) +4=10. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R in the ester is a phenyl group. So, O-CO-O-C6H5. But that would add 6 C, making the total C as 6 (benzene) +6 (ester R) =12 C. That would fit option B.

So, benzene with two substituents: one is O-CO-O-C6H5 (phenyl ester), and the other substituent? But I thought it was di-substituted, so two substituents. Wait, no, if one substituent is a phenyl ester, which is a single substituent, but that's only one substituent. So, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group.

Wait, but then the structure would be benzene with one substituent as O-CO-O-C6H5 (which is a single substituent, not di-substituted). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the structure is a benzyl ester. For example, O-CO-O-C6H5CH2, but that adds more C.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-C6H5CH2CH3, but that's getting too long.

I think I'm going in circles here. Another approach: the number of signals in the NMR.

The 1H NMR has six signals:

- 2 aromatic (each 2 H).

- 2 vinyl (each 2 H).

- 2 CH3 (each 3 H).

So, total H: 4 (aromatic) +4 (vinyl) +6 (CH3) =14 H.

So, the formula must have 14 H. That leaves options A and B.

Now, the molecular formula for each option:

A: C11H14O2 → 11 C.

B: C12H14O2 → 12 C.

So, let's think about what substituents would contribute 5 or 6 C (since benzene is 6 C).

If the substituents are:

- O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester): 4 C.

- Another substituent, say, CH3:1 C.

Total C:6+4+1=11 → fits option A.

But where are the vinyl Hs in this scenario? Because the substituents would be ethyl and methyl, which don't have vinyl Hs.

So, this can't be right because the NMR shows vinyl Hs. So, perhaps the substituent R in the ester has a vinyl group.

So, substituent R is CH2CH=CH2 → 3 C.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2 → 3 C.

Substituent 2: CH3 →1 C.

Total C:6+3+1=10 → not matching.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH2CH3 (ethyl):2 C.

So, 6+3+2=11 → option A.

But then, the substituent R (3 C) would have a vinyl group, which would contribute to the NMR signals.

In this case, the R group would have a CH2-CH=CH2 part, so the vinyl Hs would be on the CH=CH2 part.

So, the vinyl Hs would be:

- The CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl: each H is next to the CH, which has one H. So each H in CH2 would be split into a doublet (coupled with one H). So, a doublet.

- The CH in the middle would have two Hs, each coupled with the adjacent CH2 and the other CH. Wait, but in a double bond, each CH has one H. So, the structure is CH2-CH=CH2. The CH2 has two Hs, and the CH has two Hs (but wait, no, because in a double bond, each C can have only one H each if it's in a trans configuration. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-..., but that doesn't have a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl ester). The CH2-CH=CH2 part has two vinyl Hs.

In this structure, the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would have two Hs, and the CH=CH2 would have two Hs (but in a trans configuration).

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the carbonyl: each H is coupled with the CH on the double bond → doublet.

- The CH on the double bond: each H is coupled with the adjacent CH2 (two Hs) and the CH2 on the other end. So, perhaps a triplet? Or a quartet.

Wait, but in the NMR, one vinyl H is a doublet (so each H is coupled with one H) and the other is a doublet of quartets (each H is coupled with two Hs, possibly from adjacent groups).

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-..., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-O-R, but that might not fit.

I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Given that the only options with 14 H are A and B, and considering the substituents, I think the correct formula is C12H14O2. Because, perhaps, the ester substituent contributes more C.

Wait, how would that work?

If the substituent R in the ester is a propyl group (3 C), and the other substituent is a methyl group (1 C), that's 4 C. Benzene is 6 C → total 10 C. Not enough for option B (12 C).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is a benzyl group (C6H5CH2-). So, R would be C6H5CH2-O-CO-O-R. Wait, that would make the ester O-CO-O-C6H5CH2, which adds 7 C (6 from benzene +1 from CH2). But that would make the total C as 6 (benzene) +7 (ester R) =13 C, which is more than any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider the correct answer is option B, C12H14O2.

But why? Let me think about the molecular formula.

If the formula is C12H14O2, then:

- Benzene (6 C)

- Ester group: O-CO-O-R, R contributes 6 C → R must be C5H11, which is a pentyl group.

So, substituent R is pentyl: O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 → which adds 5 C and 11 H.

So, substituents:

1. O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 →5 C, 11 H.

2. Another substituent: perhaps a CH3 group →1 C, 3 H.

Total C:6 +5 +1=12 → matches option B.

H: benzene (4) + ester R (11) + CH3 (3) =18 H? But our earlier count said 14 H. Wait, something's wrong here.

Wait, wait. The ester R is C5H11: that's 11 H. But the substituent is O-CO-O-R, so the R is only the alkoxy part. So, R is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, which is 5 C and 11 H.

Wait, but the benzene has two substituents: the ester group (O-CO-O-R) and another substituent, say, a methyl group.

So, the substituents are O-CO-O-R (5 C) and CH3 (1 C). So, 5+1=6. Benzene is 6 → total 12 C.

H: benzene (4) + ester R (11 H) + CH3 (3 H) =18 H. But the formula is C12H14O2, which has 14 H. So this doesn't add up. Therefore, this structure is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent R is a cyclopentyl group or something, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R in the ester is a propyl group (3 C), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 →3 C,7 H.

Substituent 2: O-CH2-CH2- → but that doesn't contribute any C? Or perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to the ring, like CH2=CH-O-CO-O-R.

Wait, but this is getting too complex.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on the H count, the formula must have 14 H. So options A and B.

The ester group and vinyl group would contribute to higher C count. Perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (4 C) and a vinyl group (2 C). So, substituent 1:4 C, substituent 2:2 C.

Total C:6+4+2=12 → option B.

So formula would be C12H14O2.

That makes sense because the substituents would add up to 6 C beyond benzene.

So, the correct answer is option B: C12H14O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The IR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, integrating to 4 protons in total. This suggests a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, where the two substituents create two equivalent sets of aromatic protons.
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, integrating to 4 protons in total. This indicates the presence of a vinyl group with two distinct environments for the protons.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups, integrating to 6 protons in total. This suggests the presence of two distinct methyl groups in different environments.

### Key Analysis:
- The compound is di-substituted, meaning it has two substituents on the benzene ring. One substituent is an ester group (O-CO-O-R), and the other is likely a vinyl group or a group containing methyl protons.
- The total number of hydrogens in the molecule is 14, as calculated from the NMR data (4 aromatic, 4 vinyl, and 6 methyl).
- The degrees of unsaturation are calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Degrees of Unsaturation} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H)}{2} = \frac{(2C + 2 - 14)}{2}
  \]
  For the formula \(C_{11}H_{14}O_2\), this gives 5 degrees of unsaturation, while for \(C_{12}H_{14}O_2\), it gives 6 degrees of unsaturation. The benzene ring contributes 4 degrees, the ester group contributes 1, and the vinyl group contributes 1, totaling 6 degrees of unsaturation. This matches \(C_{12}H_{14}O_2\).

### Elimination of Options:
- **Option A (\(C_{11}H_{14}O_2\))**: This formula has 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for the benzene ring, the ester group, and the vinyl group. It is eliminated.
- **Option B (\(C_{12}H_{14}O_2\))**: This formula has 6 degrees of unsaturation, which correctly accounts for the benzene ring, the ester group, and the vinyl group. It matches the molecular structure inferred from the spectral data.
- **Option C (\(C_{12}H_{12}O_2\))**: This formula has 7 degrees of unsaturation, which would require an additional double bond or ring, inconsistent with the spectral data. It is eliminated.
- **Option D (\(C_{11}H_{12}O_2\))**: This formula has 6 degrees of unsaturation but only 12 hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the NMR data showing 14 hydrogens. It is eliminated.

### Conclusion:
The correct chemical formula for the compound is \(C_{12}H_{14}O_2\), as it satisfies all the spectral data and accounts for the degrees of unsaturation and hydrogen count.
