Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to find the right answer. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and exoplanets causing brightness variations. Oh right, when a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, which changes the observed brightness. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The question is asking about the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star.

Alright, let me break down the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. Oh wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots, right. So 20% of that hemisphere is spots. Each spot is cooler by 1000K, since the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K perhaps?

Wait, the temperature difference is 1000K. So spots are Teff_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K? Or maybe the spots are at 5000K, and the rest is 6000K.

But how does that affect the brightness variation? So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. Because the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side, the total brightness is a bit less than when they are not. So the change in brightness would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

But wait, the problem states that the observed brightness variation (due to the spots) is similar to what an exoplanet would cause. So I need to find the planet's radius such that the dip in brightness is the same as when the spots are on or off.

Let me think about the flux from the star. The star's total flux is based on its surface area and temperature. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot emits less flux. When the spots are on the visible side, the total flux we receive decreases, causing a dip.

The change in brightness, or the amplitude of the variation, depends on the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

So for the star, the flux without any spots would be F0 = σ * Teff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The total flux when spots are present would be F = F0 * (1 - (1 - f) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)), where f is the filling factor, because the spots don't contribute as much flux.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the area of the spots and their lower temperature.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = (σ Teff^4) * (R_star^2 / (4 D^2)), where D is the distance, but since we're comparing relative changes, the distance might cancel out.

When spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (F_spot), where F_spot is the flux lost due to spots.

F_spot would be the area of the spots times the difference in their flux per unit area.

The area of the star is π R_star^2. Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so surface area is 4π R^2. But since we're looking at one hemisphere, the area is 2π R^2. The filling factor is 0.2, so the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Each spot's flux per unit area is σ T_spot^4. So the total flux from the spots when they are facing us is A_spot * σ T_spot^4.

The star's total flux when spots are visible is F = (Star's flux without spots) - (Flux lost due to spots). So the change ΔF is F0 - F = A_spot * σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the star's normal flux is F0 = (σ Teff^4) * (4π R_star^2) / (4 D^2) ) → simplifies to σ Teff^4 R_star^2/(D^2) × (4π/4) → same as σ Teff^4 (π R_star^2) / D^2. Hmm, maybe better to think in terms of fractional change.

Alternatively, the flux from the star without spots is F = σ Teff^4 × (R_star^2 / D^2) × (4π/4) → F = σ Teff^4 × (π R_star^2) / D^2.

When spots are visible, the flux is F = σ Teff^4 (π R_star^2) / D^2 × [1 - (f) (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)] )

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, their contribution is lower. So the total flux would be F = F0 × [1 - f ( (T_spot^4) / (Teff^4) ) ].

Wait, let me think again. The area of the star is 4π R^2. Half of that (hemisphere) is 2π R^2. The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so area of spots is 0.2 × 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Each spot's flux per unit area is σ T_spot^4. So the total flux from the spots is 0.4 π R^2 × σ T_spot^4.

The total flux from the star without spots is F0 = (4π R^2) × σ Teff^4 × (1/4) → wait, because the star's cross-sectional area is π R^2, so the flux is σ Teff^4 × π R^2 / D^2. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the fractional change.

Wait, perhaps the fractional change in flux is (ΔF)/F0 = [ (A_spot) (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) ] / (A_star * Teff^4) )

Wait, because when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (A_spot) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * σ / (Teff^4 *4π R_star^2).

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let me think of it differently. The fractional change in flux (ΔF/F0) when the spots are present is equal to the area of the spots multiplied by the fractional drop in flux per unit area.

So fractional change is (A_spot / A_visible) × (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Wait, because each spot contributes less flux. So when the spots are on the visible side, the total flux is F = F0 × [1 - (A_spot / A_visible) × ( (T_spot^4) / Teff^4 ) ) ].

Wait, A_visible is the area of the hemisphere, which is 2π R^2. So A_spot is 0.2 × A_visible = 0.2 × 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

So the fractional change would be (0.4 π R^2) / (2 π R^2) ) × (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Simplify that: (0.4 / 2 ) × (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) ) → 0.2 × (1 - (5000^4 / 6000^4)).

Wait, because Teff is 6000 K, and T_spot is 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

So let me compute that. First calculate (5000/6000)^4. 5/6 is approx 0.833333. So 0.8333^4.

Compute 0.8333^2 = approximately 0.6944. Then 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035. So the fractional change is about 10.35% when the spots are entirely on the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but the star is only showing one hemisphere, and the spots are on that hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum dip in brightness would be when the entire spot area is facing us. But the star's rotation would make the spots rotate into view and then out of view, leading to a periodic variation.

Wait, but the question says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as if an exoplanet was transiting.

But wait, when an exoplanet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip in brightness is (Area_planet / Area_star) × 100%.

Wait, actually, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius. So the fractional dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

In the case of the spots, the maximum dip would be when all the spot area is in front, leading to a dip of 0.2 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4) as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but I'm getting a dip of approximately 10.35% due to the spots.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view, so the flux is lower. The amplitude of the variation is the maximum dip compared to when no spots are visible. So the dip is (the area of the spots) × (the difference in flux per unit area).

So, the dip in flux is (A_spot / A_visible) × (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the change in flux when the spots are visible. So:

ΔF = F0 - F_spots_visible.

F0 is the flux when no spots are visible (all the star's surface is at Teff). F_spots_visible is the flux when the spots are visible, which is F0 minus the flux lost due to the spots.

So the flux from the star when spots are visible is F = F0 × (1 - (f) × ( (T_spot^4) / Teff^4 ) ), where f is the filling factor (20% or 0.2).

Wait, but the filling factor is per hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 × (hemisphere area). But since the hemisphere is 2π R^2, the spots are 0.2 × 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

The total area of the star is 4π R^2, but when viewed face-on, the area is π R^2. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, but when looking at it, you see a circle of area π R^2. So when the spots are on the hemisphere that's facing us, their area is 0.4 π R^2.

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R^2) / (4 π R^2) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1. So 10% coverage.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 × 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2, as I said. So the total area of the spots is 0.4 π R^2, and the total area of the star is 4 π R^2.

So the fraction is 0.4 π R^2 / 4 π R^2 = 0.1, or 10%.

So the fractional flux change is 10% × (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which is 0.1 × (1 - (0.8333)^4)

Earlier, I computed that (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823, so 1- that is 0.5177.

So 0.1 × 0.5177 = 0.05177, or approximately 5.177% dip.

Wait, but earlier I thought when all the spots are visible, the dip is about 10%, but now it's 5%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, the calculation is: the spots cover 10% of the star's surface. Each spot is cooler, so the flux from that area is (T_spot / T_eff)^4 times the normal flux.

So the total flux when spots are visible is F = F0 × [1 - 0.1 × ( (T_spot^4) / (Teff^4) ) ]

So the dip is ΔF/F0 = 0.1 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which is 0.1 × (1 - (5^4)/(6^4)).

Compute 5^4=625, 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, or about 5.18% dip.

Wait, but wait. The star emits flux based on its entire surface. When a spot is on the hemisphere facing us, the spot's flux is less. So when the spot is on the back, it's not contributing less flux because we can't see it. But when it's on the front, the flux is reduced.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is the visible hemisphere when the star is in a certain orientation. So perhaps the way to model it is that when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip would be when all the spots are on the visible side, which is when the entire 20% of the hemisphere is visible. So for the star, the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible. But the star's surface is a sphere, so when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the spots' area is 0.2 × 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is spots.

Wait, but that's the same as earlier. So the dip is 0.1 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 5.18%.

Wait, but the question says that the star has a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star. So the dip is 10% × [1−(5/6)^4] ≈ 5.18%.

Now, for the exoplanet scenario, the dip would be (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because when the planet transits, it blocks a circular area of the star, so the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2 in terms of fractional flux.

So we have dip_exoplanet = (R_planet / R_sun)^2.

We need this dip to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is approximately 5.18% or 0.0518.

So set (R_planet / R_sun)^2 = 0.0518.

Take the square root: R_planet / R_sun = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, sqrt(0.0518) is about 0.227. So 22.7% of the star's radius.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, 0.227 is not among the options. Hmm, did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation.

Wait, maybe I should not have used 0.1 as the area fraction. Let me re-express that.

The star's surface area is 4 π R².

The area of the visible hemisphere is 2 π R².

The spots cover 20% (0.2) of the visible hemisphere, so their area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the fraction of the star's entire surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1, which is 10%.

So the dip is 10% of the star's surface, each at 5000K.

But wait, the flux per unit area is proportional to T^4, so the flux from the spot area is 0.4 π R² × (σ (5000)^4) per unit area.

The total flux when spots are present is: F = (4 π R² × σ (6000)^4 ) × (1 - (0.4 π R²)/(4 π R²) × (5000^4/6000^4) )

Wait, 4 π R² is the total surface area. When a spot is present on the visible side, the flux is F = F0 × (1 - (A_spot / A_visible) × (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the flux without spots is F0 = (4 π R²) × σ T_eff^4 × (1/4) → since the star emits in all directions, the flux received is F0 = (4 π R²) (σ T_eff^4) ) / (4 D²) ) → simplifies to π R² σ T_eff^4 / D².

When spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (A_spot) σ (T_spot^4) / D².

But A_spot is 0.4 π R², and F0 is π R² σ T_eff^4 / D².

So F = (π R² σ T_eff^4 / D² ) ) - (0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 / D² )

Factor out terms: F = (π R² σ / D² ) [ T_eff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ]

The fractional dip is (F0 - F)/F0 = (0.4 T_spot^4 )/( T_eff^4 ) * [ (T_eff^4) / (T_eff^4) ) ] → 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ?

Wait, no, because:

ΔF = F0 - F = F0 (1 - [ (T_eff^4 - 0.4 T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4 ] )

Wait, no, perhaps the fractional change is:

(F0 - F)/F0 = [ (F0 - (F0 - 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 / D² )) ] / F0

Which is (0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 / D² ) / F0.

But F0 is (π R² σ T_eff^4 ) / D².

So (0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4 / D² ) / (π R² σ T_eff^4 / D² ) ) = 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )

So this is 0.4 × (5000/6000)^4.

Which is 0.4 × (5^4 / 6^4) → 0.4 × (625/1296) → 0.4 × ≈0.482253 → 0.1929, or 19.29%.

Wait, so the dip is 19.29%?

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the dip was about 5.18%, but now it's 19.29%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the area of the spots on the entire star versus the hemisphere.

Wait, the star has a radius R, the area is 4 π R².

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which has an area of 2 π R². So spots' area is 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the spots' area as a fraction of the total star area is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%.

But when the star rotates, the spots come into the visible hemisphere. So the maximum dip is when all the 0.4 π R² spots are in the visible hemisphere. So the dip is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) × (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

Which is 0.1 × (1 - (5^4/6^4 )).

So 0.1 × (1 - 625/1296) = 0.1 × ( (1296-625)/1296 ) = 0.1 × (671/1296) ≈ 0.1 × 0.5177 = 0.05177, or ~5.18% dip.

Hmm, but earlier calculation using the alternative approach gave me a dip of 19.29%, which is 0.4 × (5^4/6^4) = 0.4 × 0.482253 ≈ 0.1929, which is about 19.3% dip. But that's not consistent. So where am I making a mistake?

Ah, I think the confusion comes from whether the spots are on the entire star or just the hemisphere. Let me correct this.

So the star's total surface area is 4 π R². The hemisphere area is 2 π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so area is 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, 10%.

Now, when the star is viewed, the visible area is 2 π R². So when spots are on the visible hemisphere, the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (2 π R²) ) = 0.2, or 20%.

Wait, that makes sense because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So when the spots are on the visible side, 20% of the hemisphere's area is spots, which is 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the dip in flux is (0.2) × (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Because the spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere. So the dip is 0.2 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.2 × (1 - (625/1296)).

Compute (625 / 1296) ≈ 0.482253.

1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2 → 0.2 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355, or 10.355% dip.

Wait, that's about 10.35% dip.

Wait, that's a bigger dip than before. So which approach is correct?

Ah, perhaps I was wrong earlier. The dip depends on the fraction of the visible area covered by spots, not the fraction of the entire star.

Because when the star's spots are on the visible side, 20% of the viewed hemisphere is spots. So the dip is 0.2 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ), which is 0.2 × 0.5177 ≈ 10.35%.

So the dip due to the spots is about 10.35%.

Now, the exoplanet transit dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We need this to equal 10.35% or 0.1035.

So (R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.1035 → R_planet/R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, the dip from the spots is about 10.35%, so the planet's dip would have to be the same. So R_planet/R_star is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is option D (~0.32).

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's flux without spots is proportional to its surface area and temperature: \( F_0 \propto R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When spots are visible, the flux decreases due to the cooler spots. The fractional change in flux is given by:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = f \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right),
     \]
     where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor of the spots on the visible hemisphere.

3. **Calculation of Flux Change**:
   - Compute \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \):
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = 0.4823.
     \]
   - Fractional change in flux:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - 0.4823 \right) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 = 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Transit Brightness Variation**:
   - The dip in brightness during a planetary transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035.
     \]
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
