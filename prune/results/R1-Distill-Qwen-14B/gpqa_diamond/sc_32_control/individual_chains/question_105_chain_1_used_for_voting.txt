Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with the same radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness variations that could mimic an exoplanet. The task is to find what the radius ratio (Rplanet/Rstar) should be to produce the same signal amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. Similarly, the spots on the star will cause a dimming effect as they rotate into and out of view, which is what causes the variation in brightness.

So I think the key here is to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Wait, but the star's spots are on one hemisphere, so as it rotates, the spots come into view, making the star dimmer. But when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip. So both situations cause a dip in brightness, but the question is about the amplitude of the signal.

The first thing I need to find is the fractional change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the fractional change caused by a planet, which is (Rplanet/Rstar)^2, assuming the planet blocks a circular area.

Wait, no, the planet blocks an area of π(Rplanet)^2, and the star's area is π(Rstar)^2. So the fractional change is (Rplanet / Rstar)^2. That's the transit depth formula. But for the star spots, it's a bit different.

The spots have a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2), because each hemisphere is half the star's surface area. So that's 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R².

But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the total brightness of the star decreases. The brightness from the star's surface is proportional to the area times the temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law). So the star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are present, the luminosity is L = L_total - (area of spots) * σ T_spot^4 + (area of spots) * σ (Teff)^4. Because the spots are cooler, their contribution is less. Wait, no, the spots are part of the star's surface. So normally, the entire star emits at Teff. When the spots are present, the area of the spots is at a lower temperature. So the total luminosity becomes:

L_total = (Area without spots) * σ Teff^4 + (Area of spots) * σ T_spot^4.

The area without spots is the star's total area minus the spots' area. The star's total area is 4π R². The area of the spots is 0.1 π R² (from earlier calculation).

So L_total = [4π R² - 0.1 π R²] * σ Teff^4 + (0.1 π R²) * σ (Teff - 1000K)^4.

Wait, wait. But the star's spots are in one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view or go out of view. So the maximum and minimum brightness would vary as the spots rotate.

Wait, but the question says that the brightness variations are periodic due to rotation, and this can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of this variation (caused by the spots) is similar to the variation caused by a planet blocking the light.

Wait, but the variation in brightness would be the change in flux when the spots are facing us. Let me think: when the star is not spotted (no spots visible), we see maximum brightness. When the spots are on the side facing us, the brightness decreases. But the brightness variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Alternatively, when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher. No, wait, no. Wait, the star emits maximum when no spots are visible. When spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases because those spots are cooler.

Wait, but when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in front, so the flux is lower. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (which doesn't have spots) is facing us, so the flux is higher. Wait, but the question says that one hemisphere is covered in spots, so when the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view and then goes away.

Wait, actually, no. If the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum flux occurs when that hemisphere is not facing us. Because when the other hemisphere (with no spots) is facing us, the flux is higher.

Wait, that makes sense. So the brightness variation would be a change from the maximum (when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible) to the minimum (when the spotty hemisphere is visible). So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between when the star is fully unspotted (if possible) and when it's spotted.

Wait, but actually, the star's surface is covered on one hemisphere, so the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

But wait, the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view. So the brightness variation would be a periodic dip as the spots rotate towards us.

Wait, but perhaps the total brightness variation when the entire hemisphere is covered by spots is what we need to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in brightness is the difference between the brightness when the spots are visible and when they're not. But when the star is rotating, the spots come in and out of view, causing the brightness to dip periodically.

But the question states that the observed brightness variation is similar to that of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (delta F) is the same as that caused by a planet.

Wait, so the amplitude of the variation in the star's brightness is equal to the amplitude caused by the planet. So we need to compute the fractional change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots, and then set that equal to the fractional change caused by the planet.

Wait, but wait. When the planet transits, the flux drops by (R_planet / R_star)^2. So the amplitude is that fraction.

But for the star with spots, the flux variation would be the difference between when the spots are visible and when they are not. So we need to compute the maximum and minimum flux, and the difference between them.

Wait, let me think again. When the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower. When that hemisphere is not visible (the other hemisphere is), the flux is higher (assuming the other hemisphere is at the same temperature as the rest of the star, which is Teff). 

So the maximum flux is when the spots are not visible (unspotted hemisphere), and the minimum is when the spots are fully visible. The difference between max and min is the amplitude.

But wait, in reality, the spots are only covering a part of the hemisphere. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere has 0.2 of its area covered in spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) / 2 = 0.2 * π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the area of a hemisphere is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20% (0.2), the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the spotted area is 0.4 π R², which is 0.1 of the total surface area (since 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1). So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, that's an important point. So spots are 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's total surface. That's a key point.

So the star's total luminosity when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us is:

L = (1 - 0.1) * L_sun + 0.1 * L_spot.

Wait, no. Let's think about the Stefan-Boltzmann law: the luminosity per unit area is sigma T^4. So the star's normal luminosity is 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

When 10% of the surface is spots at T_spot = Teff - 1000K, the total luminosity is:

L = (0.9)*4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 + (0.1)*4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff - 1000)^4.

But wait, that's when all the spots are facing us. So the maximum and minimum flux can be calculated as:

Maximum flux (when no spots are visible, i.e., the hemisphere without spots is facing us): L_max = (0.5)*4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 + (0.5)*4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no. Wait, when the hemisphere without spots is facing us, the entire visible hemisphere is at Teff. So L_max = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Wait, because the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R^2. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Similarly, when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the flux is:

L_min = (2 pi R^2 - 0.2 * 2 pi R^2) sigma Teff^4 + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2) sigma (Teff -1000)^4.

Wait, no. The hemisphere with spots covers 20% spots. So of the 2 pi R² area, 20% is spots, so 0.4 pi R² is spots. The rest is normal.

So L_min would be (2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² * sigma (Teff-1000)^4.

Which simplifies to (1.6 pi R²) sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4.

Wait, Teff is 6000K, so spots are 5000K. Wait, no, the temperature difference is 1000K. So T_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000 K? So the spots are 5000 K.

So, let's compute the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible (L_min) and when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (L_max). The maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So L_max = 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

L_min = (2 pi R² - 0.2*(2 pi R²)) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.2*(2 pi R²)) * sigma (5000)^4.

Simplify L_min:

= (1.8 * 2 pi R²) sigma (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2 pi R²) sigma (5000)^4.

Wait, no:

Wait, the spotted hemisphere's area is 2 pi R², and 20% of that is spots. So area of spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the rest, which is 1.6 pi R², is at Teff.

So L_min = (1.6 pi R²) sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 pi R²) sigma (5000)^4.

So the fractional change in flux (delta F) is (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

Wait, wait. What's the amplitude? The amplitude is the difference between max and min divided by the average, or perhaps just the max minus min. Because in transit, the dip is (Rp/Rs)^2.

Wait, in the case of a planet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rs)^2, which is the fractional decrease in flux.

So for the star's spots, the dip is (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

So let's compute that.

Compute L_max = 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

Compute L_min = 1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4.

So (L_max - L_min) = [2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4] - [1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4]

= (0.4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4) - (0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4)

= 0.4 pi R² sigma [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]

So delta F = (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

Which is:

delta F = [0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [2 pi R² sigma (6000^4)].

Simplify:

The pi R² sigma cancels out.

delta F = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)] / (2 *6000^4 )

= (0.4 / 2) * [ (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 = ?

Well, 0.8^4 is 0.4096. 0.8333^4 is higher.

Wait, 0.8333^2 is about 0.6944. Then 0.6944^2 is approximately 0.48225. So (5/6)^4≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So delta F ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355% change.

Wait, but that's the change when the spotted hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, so the dip is 10.355% of the maximum flux.

Wait, but the dip is the maximum change in flux, so that's the amplitude.

So the amplitude caused by the spots is approximately 10.355%.

Now, the planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rs)^2. So we set this equal to the delta F.

Wait, but wait: the question says to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, considering that the star is not covered by spots. So the planet's signal is (Rp/Rs)^2. We need to find Rp such that this equals the delta F I just calculated (10.355%).

Wait, no. Wait, the delta F is the fractional decrease in flux. So:

(Rp/Rs)^2 = delta F ≈ 0.10355.

So Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. Option C is ~0.11, which is about sqrt(0.0121), so 0.11^2=0.0121.

Wait, but wait: let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute (5/6)^4 precisely.

5/6 = 0.8333333...

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.694444444.

(5/6)^4 = (25/36)^2 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.517747 * 0.2 = 0.103549.

So delta F ≈ 0.10355, which is about 10.355%.

So (Rp/Rs)^2 ≈ 0.10355.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32. So the radius ratio would be about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. When the spots are on the far side, the star appears brighter. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So the dip is L_max - L_min, which would be the same as when the planet blocks the light.

Thus, the amplitude is indeed (Rp/Rstar)^2 = delta F ≈ 0.10355, so Rp/Rs ≈ 0.32.

So the correct answer should be D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius ratio \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \) that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we analyze the fractional change in flux (\( \Delta F \)) caused by the spots and equate it to the flux change caused by a planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \), same as the Sun.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Planet Signal**:
   - The flux change caused by a planet is proportional to \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \).

3. **Spot Signal**:
   - The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which corresponds to 10% of the star's total surface area.
   - The total flux is calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \( L \propto T^4 \).
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is \( L_{\text{max}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     L_{\text{min}} = (1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4).
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{L_{\text{max}} - L_{\text{min}}}{L_{\text{max}}}.
     \]

### Calculation:
1. **Flux Difference**:
   \[
   L_{\text{max}} - L_{\text{min}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \left[ 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right].
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   L_{\text{max}} - L_{\text{min}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right).
   \]

2. **Fractional Flux Change**:
   \[
   \Delta F = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right).
   \]
   Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355.
   \]

3. **Planet Radius**:
   The flux change caused by a planet is \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \). Setting this equal to \( \Delta F \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The radius ratio \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \) is approximately \( 0.32 \), which matches option **D**.
