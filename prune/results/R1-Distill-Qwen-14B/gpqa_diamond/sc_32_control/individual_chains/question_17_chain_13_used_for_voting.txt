Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says, what's the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25°C, with the pH being ideal. The K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is a stable complex. The K given is the formation constant, right? So Kf is 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think EDTA is usually in a 1:1 ratio with metal ions), the concentration of the complex [CaY] would be 0.02 M. So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (Y^4-).

The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaY]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since we're assuming the pH is ideal, the concentration of free EDTA (Y^4-) isn't affected much by protonation. So the dissociation is [CaY] = Kf * [Ca²+][Y^4-].

Wait, but in solution, the total EDTA comes from the complex. Because if I have 0.02 M CaY, then the total EDTA (free Y plus bound in CaY) would be 0.02 M, right? Because it's a 1:1 complex. Hmm, but wait, the complex is CaY^2- or something, depending on charges. Oh, I think EDTA is H4Y, which can lose protons. But in the complex, it's Y^4-.

Wait, in a solution, the EDTA is either in the free form (Y^4-) or bound as CaY^2- (since Ca²+ and Y^4- make a complex with charge Ca²+ + Y^4- = overall charge (2-4)= -2? Or wait, Ca is +2, Y is -4. So the complex is CaY^2- (since 2-4 = -2). So the charge is -2.

But when the pH is high, the EDTA is deprotonated to Y^4-. So in this problem, since pH is ideal, I can assume that EDTA exists as Y^4- in solution. So the free EDTA concentration is [Y^4-], and the complex is [CaY^2-] equals 0.02 M.

Wait, but the K expression is Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). So rearranging, [Ca²+] = [CaY^2-]/(Kf * [Y^4-]).

But the problem is, I don't know [Y^4-], but I know that [CaY^2-] + [Y^4-] = 0.02 M? No, wait, because the total concentration of EDTA is the sum of free Y^4- and the EDTA that's complexed with Ca²+. So if the solution is 0.02 M in the CaY^2- complex, then the total EDTA (free plus bound) is 0.02 M. But wait, no, no, wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M CaY^2-? Or is it that the concentration is 0.02 M of the complex.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M. So the total EDTA in solution is the sum of free Y^4- and [CaY^2-], but wait, no. Because the EDTA is in the complex. So, the total EDTA is equal to [CaY^2-] plus [Y^4-]. But wait, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that's the only source of EDTA. So yes, [CaY^2-] + [Y^4-] = 0.02 M?

Wait, no. Because the EDTA comes from the complex. So if you have 0.02 M of CaY^2-, then the EDTA in the solution is 0.02 M as Y^4- because each CaY^2- provides one Y^4- when it dissociates.

Wait no, no. Let me think again. The CaY^2- is the complex. So when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and Y^4-. So the complex is [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M. The dissociation is: CaY^2- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-. So the initial concentration is [CaY^2-] = 0.02, and the other species are zero. Then, when it dissociates, let x be the extent of dissociation (assuming x is small because Kf is large? Wait, no, wait Kf is the formation constant, which is large, so the complex is stable, meaning that dissociation is not favored. So Kf is large, which would mean that the reverse reaction (dissociation) is not favored. So [Ca²+] would be small.

Wait, Kf is formation constant: Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

So if Kf is 5e10, the denominator must be very small. So either [Ca²+] or [Y^4-] is very small.

But wait, in this case, the total EDTA is [CaY^2-] + [Y^4-]. Because the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x, where x is the concentration of Y^4-. Or wait, no. Let me think: the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. As it dissociates, it produces x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of Y^4-. So, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x.

But if Kf is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so x would be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are both x.

So substituting into Kf equation: Kf ≈ 0.02/(x^2) =5e10.

So x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = 4e-13 → x ≈ 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5? Wait wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4) x sqrt(1e-13) → 2 x 1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = approx 6.3e-7. So x is about 6.3e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7, which is option C.

Wait, the options are A) 2e-2, B)5e-3, C)6.3e-7, D)1e-2.

So the answer should be C.

But wait, wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me go through the steps again.

Given:

[CaY^2-] = 0.02 M.

Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) =5e10.

Assuming that the dissociation is x, so:

[Ca²+] = x,

[Y^4-] =x,

[CaY^2-] ≈0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02).

So Kf =0.02/(x^2) =5e10 → x^2= 0.02/(5e10) → x^2=4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2 * 1e-6.5 → 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7=6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C. So the answer is C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and assuming minimal dissociation due to the large \( K_f \), the dissociation extent \( x \) is very small. Thus, \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and the concentrations of free ions are approximately equal, i.e., \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the \( K_f \) expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
