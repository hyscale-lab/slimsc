Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options given are points in three-dimensional space with coordinates like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are related to the Bloch sphere representation of qubits, but I'm not entirely sure how to map the density matrix to a point in space.

Wait, I think for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (like the Bloch vector) in three dimensions. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So any 2x2 density matrix can be written this way, right?

Let me write down the general form. The identity matrix I is 2x2, and the Pauli matrices are each 2x2 too. So when you compute r·σ, you're taking the dot product of vector r with the vector of Pauli matrices. That would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Then you add the identity matrix I and multiply by 1/2.

So for the given ρ, ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|), I need to express this in terms of I and the Pauli matrices. Let me compute ρ explicitly. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together, we get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (1/2) * I.

Wait, so ρ is (I)/2. Now, according to the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So setting this equal to (I)/2, we have (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives I + r·σ = I. Subtracting I from both sides, we get r·σ = 0. So the vector r multiplied by the Pauli matrices equals zero matrix. So the only solution is r = (0,0,0), because any non-zero r would give a non-zero matrix.

So the Bloch vector r is zero, which means the point is at the origin (0,0,0) in three-dimensional space. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

Wait a second, let me double-check. The given density matrix is a completely mixed state, right? Because |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are pure states, and averaging them equally would give a maximally mixed state. For a qubit, a maximally mixed state is represented by the density matrix I/2, which corresponds to the completely depolarized state. So on the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the origin because it's the center of the sphere. That makes sense. All the other points on the Bloch sphere correspond to pure states with r of length 1, and mixed states with r less than 1. But if r is zero, that's the center, the completely mixed state.

So yeah, so the geometrical position in qubit space should be at (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the general form of a density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is the vector of Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector in three-dimensional space. 

For the given \(\rho\), expanding \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right|\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\) yields the identity matrix \(I\). Thus, 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form, we find that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in three-dimensional space, representing the completely mixed state. 

Among the given options, the point \((0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to option C.
