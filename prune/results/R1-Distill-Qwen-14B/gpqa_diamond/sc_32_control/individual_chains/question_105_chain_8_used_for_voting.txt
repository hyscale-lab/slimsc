Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup says that when this star is observed, the brightness variations due to rotation look like there's an exoplanet causing them. The question is, what radius would a planet need to have to produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Wait, so the star isn't actually being eclipsed by a planet; it's just the spots that are causing the change. But if we didn't have the spots, what planet size would mimic that change? So we're comparing the brightness dip from the planet to the dip from the spots.

First, I remember that the brightness variation (the amplitude of the light curve) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

But wait, that's if the planet blocks some of the star's light. So when the planet passes in front, the observed flux drops by that fraction.

In this case, the star has spots. When the spots are facing us, the star's total brightness is lower because the spots are cooler. But the spots are only on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, more or less of the spots come into view. So the brightness variation is due to the changing amount of spotted area visible.

But wait, the problem says the spots are covering 20% of one hemisphere. So the filling factor is 0.2. But the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun.

Wait, no. The hemisphere is one half of the star. So the total area of the star is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Because the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible from Earth changes. The problem says only one hemisphere is spotty, so when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere towards us, more spots are visible. So the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating in and out of view.

Wait, no. Actually, the star is showing one hemisphere with spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view as the star rotates. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotty side is facing us. But wait, because the star is a sphere, when it's at a certain phase, only a portion of the spots are visible. So the brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness without spots is L0 = 4πR² * sigma * Teff^4. But the spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = Teff - 1000K = 5000K.

The area of the spots is A_spots = 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2πR², so A_spots = 0.4πR².

Flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4.

When the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is fully visible (but wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see the entire spot area? Or does the rotation cause only a part of the spots to be visible? Hmm, perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, and when you have a spot on one hemisphere, as it rotates, the spot comes into view and then goes out of view. But in this problem, the entire hemisphere is covered with spots, so when that hemisphere faces us, we see all the spots. But wait, that's only when the star's rotation brings that part into our line of sight. So the maximum change in flux occurs when the spotty hemisphere is either exactly towards us (minimal flux) or away (max flux), but wait, no—because the hemisphere is fully covered with spots, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4πR² area is emitting at the lower temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total flux as the star rotates. When the star is at a certain rotational phase, a certain fraction of the spotted area is visible. The brightness variation depends on how much of the star's surface is emitting at the lower temperature. 

But perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the maximum and minimum flux and find the amplitude.

Alternatively, the total flux when the spotted area is visible is the sum of the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The unspotted part is 4πR² - A_spots = 4πR² - 0.4πR² = 3.6πR². The flux from this part is sigma * Teff^4 * 3.6πR² / (4πR²) )? Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, the star's total flux is the sum of the flux from each part. The unspotted part has area 3.6πR² (since 4πR² is the whole star, and 0.4πR² is the spotted area). So the unspotted flux is (3.6πR²) * sigma * Teff^4, and the spotted part is (0.4πR²) * sigma * (Teff - 1000)^4.

Wait, no. The flux from each area is sigma * T^4. So the total flux F is:

F = (Area_unspotted * sigma * Teff^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma * (Teff - deltaT)^4 )

So when the star is such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotty = (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * sigma * (6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * sigma * (5000)^4

Simplify that:

F_spotty = (3.6πR² * sigma * 6000^4) + (0.4πR² sigma 5000^4)

The maximum flux F_max is when the star is fully unspotted as viewed, so F_max = 4πR² sigma (6000)^4.

The minimum flux F_min is F_spotty.

Wait, no. Wait, the hemisphere with spots is 50% of the star's surface? No, the star's surface is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the surface area. So if 20% of one hemisphere is covered with spots, then the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4πR² is in view. So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotty = (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * sigma * (6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * sigma * (5000)^4.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire star's surface is 4πR². The spotty hemisphere has 0.4πR² of spots. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spotted area is entirely visible. So the flux is:

F = (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * sigma * Teff^4 + 0.4πR² * sigma * (Teff - deltaT)^4

But wait, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotted area is visible. So F_spotty is as above.

The maximum flux F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so all the star's surface is at Teff.

Wait, no. Wait, the star has two hemispheres: one with spots, and one without. So when the star is viewed such that the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, the flux is F_max = 4πR² sigma Teff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = (4πR² - 0.4πR²) * sigma Teff^4 + 0.4πR² sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4.

Wait, no. The unspotted area is (4πR²) minus the spotted area, which is 0.4πR². So the unspotted area is 3.6πR². And the spotted area is 0.4πR².

So F_spotty = (3.6πR²) * sigma Teff^4 + (0.4πR²) * sigma (Teff - 1000)^4.

The flux when the star is unspotted in our view is F_unspotted = 4πR² sigma Teff^4.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_unspotted - F_spotty) / F_unspotted.

So let's compute that.

Compute F_spotty:

F_spotty = (3.6 π R² sigma Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4 )

Factor out sigma π R²:

F_spotty = sigma π R² [ 3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ]

Similarly, F_unspotted = sigma π R² [4 Teff^4 ]

So the difference is F_unspotted - F_spotty = sigma π R² [4 Teff^4 - 3.6 Teff^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ].

Simplify:

= sigma π R² [0.4 Teff^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ]

= 0.4 sigma π R² [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

The amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotty)/F_unspotted = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)] / (4 *6000^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Amplitude = (0.4 (6^4 -5^4 )) / (4 *6^4 ) * (sigma π R²) * (sigma π R²) ??? Wait, no. Wait, because F_unspotted is 4 sigma pi R² Teff^4, so the amplitude is:

Amplitude = [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) Teff^4 ] / [4 Teff^4 ].

Wait, no, because sigma pi R² cancels out in numerator and denominator.

So amplitude = (0.4 (6^4 - 5^4 )) / 4.

Calculate 6^4: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296.

5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625.

So 6^4 -5^4 = 1296 - 625 = 671.

So amplitude = (0.4 * 671) /4 = (268.4) /4 = 67.1.

Wait, but that's in terms of (sigma Teff^4) units. Wait, no, because when I compute it as (F_unspotted - F_spotty)/F_unspotted, the units are dimensionless.

So the amplitude is 67.1 / 4 * (1/6000^4?), wait no, no. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, F_unspotted = 4 Teff^4 * sigma pi R².

F_spotty = [3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ] * sigma pi R².

So F_unspotted - F_spotty = (4 Teff^4 - 3.6 Teff^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ) sigma pi R².

Which is (0.4 Teff^4 - 0.4 (5000)^4 ) sigma pi R².

So the amplitude is that divided by F_unspotted.

So amplitude = [0.4 (Teff^4 - (5000)^4) ] / (4 Teff^4 )

= [0.4 ( (6000^4) - (5000)^4 ) ] / (4 *6000^4 )

= (0.4 * (1296e8 - 625e8 )) / (4 * 1296e8 )

Wait, let me compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296 *1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4= (5e3)^4=625e12=6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 =1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So 0.4 * 6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Divide by (4 * 1.296e15 )=5.184e15.

So (2.684e14) / (5.184e15 ) = approximately 0.0517.

Wait, 2.684e14 is 2.684 x10^14.

5.184e15 is 5.184 x10^15.

So 2.684e14/5.184e15 = (2.684/5.184) * 10^(-1) ≈ (0.517) * 0.1 ≈ 0.0517.

So amplitude is about 5.17%.

Wait, that's the brightness variation when the spot hemisphere is facing us. So the change is about 5% of the star's flux.

Now, if a planet is causing the same variation, it would block a certain area when it transits. The transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We need to set that equal to 0.0517 (the 5.17% amplitude).

So (R_planet / R_sun )^2 = 0.0517.

Take square root: R_planet / R_sun = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, that's approximately 0.227 R_sun. But wait, the options are given as fractions relative to the host star's radius. Since R_star is same as Sun, R_planet/Rstar is 0.227.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.227 isn't close to any of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation differently. Maybe I should consider that when the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area that's visible changes. So the brightness variation isn't just a step between F_max and F_spotty. Instead, it's a sinusoidal variation as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, perhaps the situation is that the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible varies. The maximum variation occurs when the center of the spotty hemisphere is along our line of sight (so maximum spot area blocked), and the minimum when it's opposite.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spot is on the edge, the visible area of the spot would increase as it rotates toward us. So maybe the brightness variation is a sine function.

Alternatively, maybe the amplitude is (delta F) = (A_spots * (Teff - T_spot)^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 )

Wait, that might be a simpler approach. Let me think.

The total flux when all spots are visible is F = (4 pi R^2 - A_spots) * Teff^4 + A_spots (T_spot)^4, all multiplied by sigma/(4 pi R^2) ?

Wait, no. The flux without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) )? No, wait, the flux is sigma T^4 * area, so F = sigma T^4 * area.

Wait, the total flux is the sum of the flux from each part.

So without spots, F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

With spots, F = (4 pi R^2 - A_spots) sigma Teff^4 + A_spots sigma T_spot^4.

So the difference is delta F = F - F0 = (4 pi R^2 - A_spots) sigma Teff^4 + A_spots sigma T_spot^4 - 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Simplify:

delta F = - A_spots sigma Teff^4 + A_spots sigma T_spot^4.

= A_spots sigma (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )

So the fractional change is delta F / F0.

delta F / F0 = [ A_spots sigma (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 )

Simplify:

= (A_spots / (4 pi R^2 )) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) / Teff^4.

But A_spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So (A_spots / (4 pi R^2 )) = (0.4 pi R^2 )/(4 pi R^2 ) )= 0.1.

So delta F / F0 = 0.1 * ( (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Wait, T_spot is 5000 K, Teff is 6000 K.

So (5000^4 - 6000^4) is negative. So the fractional change is negative, meaning the flux is lower when the spots are visible.

The magnitude is 0.1 * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 )

As before, 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 =6.25e14.

Difference is 6.71e14.

So (6.71e14 ) / (1.296e15 ) ≈ 0.517.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517.

So 5.17% dip, same as before.

So the amplitude is about 5.17%.

Now, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_planet / R_star )^2.

We need to set (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.0517.

So R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

So approximately 0.23 R_star. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the time variation. The problem says that the star has a hemisphere covered with spots, and as it rotates, the brightness varies. The variation is periodic, and resembles a planet transit.

But when a planet transits, the dip is a sharp drop, but the spot-induced variation is a sinusoidal variation as the star rotates, with the phase curve having a certain shape.

Wait, but the question says the photometric time-series will show periodic variations due to rotation. The amplitude of this variation is similar to the dip caused by a planet. So the maximum dip (when the spot is fully in front) is 5.17%, but the variation around that would be the amplitude of the brightness change. So the net change is 5.17% from the maximum to the minimum, which is a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 5.17%.

But when a planet transits, the dip is a single event, so the amplitude is the depth of the dip, which is 5.17% in this case. So the planet's transit would cause a 5.17% dip, which would require (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.0517 → R_planet ≈ 0.227 R_star.

But the options don't have 0.23. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in the brightness due to the spots as a sinusoidal function, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak change. So maybe I should model the brightness variation as a function of the rotational phase.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the change in flux when the spots are only partially visible. For example, when the star is viewed edge-on, perhaps the spots are only partially visible. So the variation would be a function of the cosine of the angle.

Wait, perhaps the way to model the brightness variation is using the concept of the "brightness modulation" due to the spots. The amplitude of the brightness variation depends on how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

The maximum variation occurs when the center of the spotted hemisphere is along our line of sight (so we see the maximum area of spots), and the minimum when it's opposite.

Wait, but the way the spots are distributed, perhaps the brightness variation has a certain amplitude. So perhaps the amplitude is the difference between when the spotty hemisphere is towards us and away from us.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try an alternative approach.

The maximum dip is 5.17% of the star's flux. So when the planet transits, it causes a 5.17% dip. Thus, the planet's area is (R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.0517 → R_planet = 0.227 R_star.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area of the spots.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the area of the spots. The problem states that the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R². That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the star is viewed at a certain phase, the fraction of the spotted area visible is (1 - cos(theta)/2 ), where theta is the rotational angle. So the maximum amplitude isn't just the full dip but an average.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness is such that the amplitude is (delta F) = (A_spots (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 ), but scaled by a factor related to the rotational modulation.

Wait, another approach: the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (F_max = F0), and the minimum is when the maximum number of spots are visible (F_min). The amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F0.

Earlier calculation gave that as 5.17%.

So if a planet causes the same amplitude, its transit depth (which is (R_p / R_s)^2) would be 5.17%, so R_p ≈ 0.227 R_s.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Let me think about the brightness variation when the star is observed. The star has spots on one hemisphere, and when it rotates, the amount of spotted area that is visible changes. The brightness variation would be a function of the cosine of the angle, perhaps.

Wait, the brightness as a function of rotational phase φ can be modeled as:

F(φ) = F0 [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) + (f * (1 - f) ) * ( ... ) ]

Wait, not sure. Maybe a better approach is to model the visible area of the spots as a function of the phase.

The fraction of the spotty hemisphere visible is given by:

f(φ) = (1 + cos φ ) / 2, where φ is the rotational phase. So when φ=0, the center of the spotty hemisphere is towards us, so maximum spots visible. When φ=180 degrees, the center is away, so minimum spots visible.

Wait, but perhaps the area of the spotted region visible is A_visible = A_spots * (1 + cos φ ) / 2.

So the flux at phase φ is:

F(φ) = [ (4 pi R² - A_visible ) * Teff^4 + A_visible * T_spot^4 ] * sigma / 4 pi R².

So the fractional flux is:

F(φ) / F0 = [ (4 pi R² - A_visible ) * Teff^4 + A_visible * T_spot^4 ] / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

= [4 pi R² Teff^4 - A_visible Teff^4 + A_visible T_spot^4 ] / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

= 1 - (A_visible (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

= 1 - (A_visible / (4 pi R² )) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

But since A_visible = A_spots * (1 + cos φ ) / 2.

And A_spots = 0.4 pi R².

So A_visible = 0.4 pi R² * (1 + cos φ ) / 2.

= 0.2 pi R² (1 + cos φ )

So [A_visible / (4 pi R² ) ] = [0.2 pi R² (1 + cos φ ) ] / (4 pi R² ) ) = 0.2 (1 + cos φ ) /4 = (1 + cos φ ) / 20.

So the fractional flux becomes:

F(φ)/F0 = 1 - ( (1 + cos φ ) /20 ) * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

We know 6000^4 -5000^4 =6.71e14.

(6.71e14)/(1.296e15) ≈ 0.517.

So F(φ)/F0 = 1 - ( (1 + cos φ ) /20 ) * 0.517.

Which simplifies to:

F(φ)/F0 = 1 - (0.517/20)(1 + cos φ )

= 1 - (0.02585)(1 + cos φ )

= 1 - 0.02585 - 0.02585 cos φ

= 0.97415 - 0.02585 cos φ.

So the maximum and minimum fluxes are when cos φ is 1 and -1.

Maximum F(φ)/F0 = 0.97415 - 0.02585 *1 = 0.9483.

Minimum F(φ)/F0 = 0.97415 - 0.02585*(-1) = 0.97415 + 0.02585 = 1.0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when cos φ is -1, 1 + cos phi is 0, so A_visible is zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, when φ=180 degrees, cos phi is -1. So 1 + (-1) =0, so A_visible is zero.

So F(φ)=F0, which makes sense because no spots are visible.

Wait, but according to the equation F(φ)/F0 = 0.97415 - 0.02585 cos phi.

When phi =0, cos phi=1: F= 0.97415 - 0.02585 = 0.9483. So 5.17% dip.

When phi=180, cos phi=-1: F=0.97415 + 0.02585 = 1.0. So 0 dip.

Wait, but that's just the same as before. So the variation is sinusoidal with amplitude 0.02585 (≈2.585% of F0).

Wait, wait no. The function is F(φ)/F0 = 0.97415 - 0.02585 cos phi.

The maximum is 0.97415 - 0.02585 *1 = 0.9483.

The minimum is 0.97415 - 0.02585*(-1) = 0.97415 + 0.02585 = 1.0.

Wait, that implies that the maximum brightness is 1.0, and the minimum is 0.9483. So the variation is a decrease of 5.17% when the spots are fully visible (phi=0), and no change when the spots are hidden.

But that's just the same as before, which suggests that the amplitude is 5.17% dip.

But according to the equation, the variation depends on cos phi. So the brightness variation as a function of phase is a sinusoidal curve with peak-to-peak amplitude of 2 * 0.02585 = 0.0517, which is 5.17%.

Wait, because the function is F(φ) = 0.97415 - 0.02585 cos phi.

The maximum value occurs when cos phi is -1: 0.97415 + 0.02585 = 1.0.

The minimum when cos phi is 1: 0.97415 - 0.02585 = 0.9483.

So the peak-to-peak variation is 0.0517, which is 5.17%.

So the amplitude is 5.17% of the star's brightness.

So if a planet were to cause the same amplitude, its transit would have a depth of 5.17%.

So the planet's area would be (R_p / R_s )^2= 0.0517 → R_p = sqrt(0.0517) R_s ≈ 0.227 R_s.

But the options don't have 0.23. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as a planet would cause a dip when it transits, but the spots cause a similar dip during rotation. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the planet's transit depth.

But in the case of the star, the dip is 5.17%. So if the planet's transit depth is also 5.17%, the radius is 0.227 R_s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's area.

Wait, the problem says the star's radius is equal to the Sun. So R_star = R_sun.

The spot's filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R_star^2 )= 0.4 pi R_star^2.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the star's brightness without spots. So the comparison is that the same dip would be caused by a planet. So the dip is 5.17% of the star's flux, so the planet's area is 5.17% of the star's area.

But what if the star's flux without spots is F0, and the spots cause a dip. The planet, when it transits, causes a dip equal to the same fractional change.

So (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.0517 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_s.

Hmm, but none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's contribution.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the calculation.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

Difference: 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

Now, 6.71e14 /1.296e15 = 671e12 / 1296e12 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.517.

So 0.517 is the relative contribution of the spots.

But the fractional change when the spots are fully visible is (A_spots / (4 pi R^2 )) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) / Teff^4.

(A_spots / (4 pi R^2 )) = (0.4 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) )= 0.1.

So fractional change is 0.1 * ( (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / 6000^4 ) = 0.1 * (-0.517) = -0.0517.

So the dip is 5.17%, as before.

So the planet needs to cause a 5.17% dip, which requires R_p = sqrt(0.0517) R_s ≈ 0.227 R_s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe I should consider the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but perhaps in the planet case, the star's radius is different. No, the question says "if the star was not covered by spots!", so the star's radius is the same as the exoplanet's host star.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is not a dip but a variation, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation.

In the earlier calculation, the function F(φ)/F0 = 0.97415 - 0.02585 cos phi.

The maximum F is 1.0 (when phi=180), the minimum is 0.9483 (when phi=0).

So the peak-to-peak variation is 0.0517, which is 5.17% of F0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.17% (peak-to-peak), which is the same as the planet's transit depth.

Wait, but a planet's transit depth is a one-time dip, whereas the spots cause a variation that goes from 1.0 down to 0.9483 and back. So the peak-to-peak is 5.17%, but the amplitude as a percentage of the mean is (1.0 - 0.9483)/2 ≈ 2.585%.

Wait, no. The amplitude in the context of brightness variation is usually the peak-to-peak change, so 5.17% in this case.

But perhaps the planet's transit would have a dip of 5.17% of the star's brightness, so (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.0517, leading to R_p ≈ 0.227 R_s.

But again, the options don't have this value.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is such that the amplitude is the same as the planet's transit depth, but the planet would cause a dip of 5.17% of the star's flux. So R_p = sqrt(0.0517) R_s ≈ 0.227 R_s.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness as the spots rotate, which is a function of the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the star's rotation axis.

Wait, another thought: when a planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_s )^2.

In this problem, the star's brightness variation due to spots is (A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R_s^2 Teff^4 ) → which is 0.0517.

So setting (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.0517 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's area.

Wait, perhaps the area of the spots is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So it's 20% of the hemisphere, not 20% of the entire star.

So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R². Which is what I used earlier.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute the ratio again.

Wait, let me compute 0.0517^0.5.

0.0517^0.5 = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Which is approximately 0.23, which is about 1/4.3. None of the options are close. The closest option is C) ~0.11, which is 0.11 → ~0.0123 in square.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness as a result of the spots being on one hemisphere, and the star's rotation causing a sinusoidal variation. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (delta F) = (A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 ) ) * (1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps the maximum change is 0.0517, but the amplitude of the variation is half that, so 0.02585, leading to R_p ≈ sqrt(0.02585) ≈ 0.16 R_s.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think: when the star has spots on one hemisphere, the maximum brightness variation is when the entire hemispherical area is visible. But for a star, the spots can't be on the entire hemisphere; only 20% is spot-covered.

Wait, wait, no. The problem states that the hemisphere is covered with spots at a filling factor of 20%. So the area is 0.4 pi R².

But when the star rotates, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots that is visible changes. So the maximum coverage is when the entire 0.4 pi R² is visible, and the minimum is when none is visible.

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on, the spot coverage would be minimal. So the brightness variation would have a certain amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation's amplitude is (A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 pi R² Teff^4 ), which is 0.0517, so setting that equal to (R_p / R_s )^2.

But that brings us back to the same calculation.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer in the options. Since 0.227 is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121) ~ 0.11.

Wait, 0.11^2=0.0121. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change.

Wait, perhaps the fractional change is 0.0121.

Wait, let's recompute the fractional change.

A_spots = 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

So A_spots = 0.4 pi R².

The area fraction is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R² ) ) = 0.1.

So 10% of the star's surface is spots.

The temperature difference: T_spot = 5000 K.

So the fractional change in flux is 0.1 * (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Wait, no, it's (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / 6000^4 = (625e12 - 1296e12 ) / 1296e12 = (-671e12 ) / 1296e12 )= -0.517.

So the fractional change is 0.1 * (-0.517) = -0.0517, a 5.17% dip.

So the planet's radius would need to cause the same 5.17% dip.

Thus, R_p^2/R_s^2=0.0517 → R_p=0.227 R_s.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is modeled differently. Maybe the spots are on the surface, and the brightness variation due to rotation is such that the amplitude is (A_spots (Teff - T_spot )) / (4 pi R^2 Teff ) ) ?

No, that's not right because flux depends on T^4, not T.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness due to the spots as a planet transit, but the planet's effect is averaged over the rotation period. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the star's flux when the spots are present, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the planet that would produce the same change in brightness as the spots, but when the star is not covered by spots. So the star's brightness without spots would be F0. The planet would cause a dip of (R_p^2/R_s^2) F0. The spots cause a dip of 0.0517 F0. So to get the same dip, R_p^2/R_s^2=0.0517 → R_p=0.227 R_s.

But again, no option matches.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in considering the area of the spots. Suppose the star's radius is R, but the spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20% of the entire star's surface. No, the problem says one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is observed, the spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere as the star rotates, but that's not how the problem is stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view, but the maximum area visible is 20% of the hemisphere. So the maximum spot area visible at any time is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R² * (1/2) )=0.2 pi R².

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered in spots. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.2 * 2 pi R² =0.4 pi R² is visible.

But when the star rotates, perhaps the visible area of the spots is a function of the cosine of the angle.

Wait, perhaps the maximum spot area visible is 0.4 pi R², and the minimum is zero. So the dip is 5.17%, as calculated.

But I'm back to the same conclusion.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the area blocked by the planet versus the area of spots.

The area of the spots is 0.4 pi R².

The area blocked by the planet is pi (R_p)^2.

The brightness variation from the planet is (pi R_p^2 )/(4 pi R_s^2 ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2 ).

The brightness variation from the spots is 0.0517, which is (0.4 pi R_s^2 ) * (5000^4 ) / (4 pi R_s^2 *6000^4 ) ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4.

Wait, no, that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is (delta F) = (A_spots) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 ).

Which is 0.4 pi R² * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 pi R² *6000^4 ) ) = (0.4/4 ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4.

Which is 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 =0.1 *0.517=0.0517.

So the same as before.

So the dip is 5.17% of the star's brightness.

Thus, the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.0517) R_s ≈ 0.227 R_s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is looking for the relative area, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the star's brightness due to the spots as a flat 20% dip, which would give a different result.

Wait, if the spots cause a 20% dip, then the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.2 )= ~0.447, which is near option A (0.39) but not exact.

But earlier calculations show the dip is 5.17%, not 20%.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots as 20% of the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere.

If the spot area is 20% of the entire star, then A_spots = 0.2 *4 pi R² = 1.2566 pi R².

Then the dip would be (1.2566 pi R² ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 pi R² *6000^4 ) = (1.2566/4 ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4.

= 0.31415 * (0.517 ) ≈ 0.1625, or 16.25% dip.

Then the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1625 )=~0.403 R_s, which is close to option A (0.39). So perhaps this is the intended approach.

But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty, so the spot area can't be 20% of the entire star, only 20% of one hemisphere.

But perhaps the problem is phrased such that the spots are 20% of the entire star, not just one hemisphere. That would change the calculation.

In that case, A_spots = 0.2 *4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R².

Then, the dip would be (0.8 pi R² ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 pi R² 6000^4 )

= 0.8/4 * (671e12 )/(1.296e15 )

= 0.2 * (0.517 ) = 0.1034, or 10.34% dip.

So the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1034) ≈ 0.321 R_s, which is close to option D) ~0.32.

So perhaps the problem intended the spot area to be 20% of the entire star, leading to a dip of ~10%, requiring a planet radius of ~0.32 R_s.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots have a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The spots cause a brightness dip due to their lower temperature. The amplitude of this dip depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

3. **Exoplanet Comparison**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).
   - We need to calculate the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots.

---

### Step 1: Area of the Spots
The spotted hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. The area of one hemisphere is \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), so the area of the spots is:
\[
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
\]

---

### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The total brightness of the star without spots is:
\[
F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
\]
When the spots are visible, the brightness becomes:
\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = \left( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 - A_{\text{spots}} \right) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + A_{\text{spots}} \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4.
\]
Substituting \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), we get:
\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = \left( 3.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \right) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + \left( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \right) \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4.
\]
The fractional brightness variation is:
\[
\frac{F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_0} = \frac{3.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{spot}}^4}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_0} = 1 - \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
\]
\[
\frac{F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_0} = 1 - \frac{0.4}{4} \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
\]
The temperature ratio is:
\[
\frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \frac{6000^4 - 5000^4}{6000^4}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15}, \quad 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14}.
\]
\[
\frac{6000^4 - 5000^4}{6000^4} = \frac{6.71 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.517.
\]
Substituting:
\[
\frac{F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_0} = 1 - 0.1 \times 0.517 = 1 - 0.0517 = 0.9483.
\]
The fractional brightness variation is:
\[
\Delta F = 1 - \frac{F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_0} = 1 - 0.9483 = 0.0517 \, \text{(or 5.17%)}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Exoplanet Radius for the Same Brightness Variation
The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is:
\[
\Delta F = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
\]
Setting \( \Delta F = 0.0517 \):
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.0517.
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0517} \approx 0.227.
\]

---

### Step 4: Reconciling with the Options
The calculated radius \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem assumes the spots cover 20% of the **entire star's surface** (instead of just one hemisphere), the area of the spots becomes:
\[
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
\]
Repeating the calculation with this assumption:
\[
\Delta F = \frac{0.8}{4} \times 0.517 = 0.2 \times 0.517 = 0.1034 \, \text{(or 10.34%)}.
\]
For the planet:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1034.
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1034} \approx 0.321.
\]
This matches closely with **Option D (~0.32)**.

---

### Conclusion
The problem likely assumes the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface, leading to a brightness variation of approximately 10.34%. The exoplanet radius required to produce the same variation is approximately \( 0.32 R_{\text{star}} \).

**Answer: D**
