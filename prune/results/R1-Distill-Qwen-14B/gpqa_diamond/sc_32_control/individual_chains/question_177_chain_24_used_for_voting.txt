Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The spectroscopy showed that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength for a black body, which relates to temperature via Wien's law.

Wait, Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars emit their maximum at the same wavelength, they must have the same temperature. So T1 equals T2.

Now, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right, so the Doppler shift could change the observed wavelength. But in the problem, they determined the wavelength at which the stars appeared brightest. So I think that's the observed wavelength, not the intrinsic one.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So if the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths would shift. But the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So that might imply that their temperatures are the same when observed, but their actual temperatures could be different?

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The stars' intrinsic peak emission (from their own rest frames) might be different if they're moving. But the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler effect would have shifted their peaks to the same observed wavelength. But that might complicate things because then their intrinsic temperatures would differ.

Wait, but the problem says they radiate as black bodies. So maybe the observed luminosity is calculated using the observed parameters. Or perhaps the question is implying that the stars themselves have the same temperature because their observed peak wavelengths are the same. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

Assuming that the stars' temperatures are the same because their peak wavelengths are the same when observed. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us (if radial velocity is 700 km/s, but I'm not sure about the direction), that would cause a blueshift. If Star_1 has radial velocity 0, then maybe Star_2 is moving towards or away, affecting the observed wavelength.

Wait, no. They observed the same wavelength as the peak. So let's say the peak wavelength for each star in their rest frame is lambda1 and lambda2. Then, their observed peaks are lambda_obs_1 and lambda_obs_2, which are the same, say lambda_obs.

But wait, the problem states that the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs.

So, for each star, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs. Now, how does the star's actual temperature relate to this?

The Doppler shift formula is lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much less than c, which it is here. Because 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (since c is about 3e5 km/s). So the approximation holds.

Wait, v is the radial velocity. If Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s, let's assume it's moving towards us (v positive? Or depending on the sign convention. Sometimes v is positive when moving away, but the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. Hmm, but the direction isn't specified, so perhaps it's irrelevant as we can take the magnitude.)

Wait, but for Doppler shift, the observed wavelength depends on whether the star is moving towards or away. If Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, that's a significant speed. Let's think about how it affects the observed temperature.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the stars' rest frame. Because the luminosity calculation using black body radiation is based on their actual temperatures, not the observed ones. Because if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted, but the actual emission comes from its own temperature.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to clarify.

If a star emits as a black body at temperature T, its peak wavelength is lambda_peak = b / T (Wien's law), with b being Wien's displacement constant. If the star is moving with some velocity v towards us, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_peak * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v/c. So, the observed peak would be different.

In this problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2 = lambda_obs.

But Star_1 has v_r = 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest frame lambda_peak_1. For Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s, let's assume it's moving away (so v is positive, leading to a redshift) or towards us (v is negative, leading to blueshift). But to have lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2, their rest frame lambdas must differ based on their velocities.

Wait, let's think more carefully.

Let me denote:

For Star_1:
v1 = 0, so lambda_obs_1 = lambda_peak_1.

For Star_2:
v2 = 700 km/s.

Assuming v2 is positive (moving away), then the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). So lambda_obs_2 = lambda_peak_2 * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta = v2/c.

But given that lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2, we have:

lambda_peak_1 = lambda_peak_2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But lambda_peak is inversely proportional to T, so lambda_peak_1 = b / T1, lambda_peak_2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

Alternatively,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

Wait, but v2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute beta.

v2 = 700,000 m/s. c = 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s. So beta = v2/c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So (1 + beta) ≈ 1.02333, (1 - beta) ≈ 0.97667.

Compute sqrt( (1.02333)/(0.97667) )

Let me calculate this:

1.02333 / 0.97667 ≈ 1.048 approximately.

Then sqrt(1.048) ≈ 1.0237.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0237.

So T2 is higher than T1.

Ok, so now, the temperatures are not the same. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

But wait, the problem says that the stars' luminosities are to be compared. So, what's the formula for luminosity? The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4 pi R² sigma T^4.

So the luminosity depends on R squared and T to the fourth power.

Given that, let's compute L1 and L2.

We have:

R1 = 1.5 R2.

Because Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2.

Wait, no, wait. No, the problem says Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2, where R2 is Star_2's radius.

Wait, let me check the question again.

"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2."

Yes. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So now, the luminosity ratio is L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But wait, from earlier, T2 = T1 * 1.0237, so T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0237 ≈ 0.9766.

So,

L1 / L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9766)^4.

Compute each part.

1.5^2 = 2.25.

0.9766^4: Let me compute that.

First, 0.9766 squared is approx (0.9766)^2 ≈ 0.9538.

Then squared again: 0.9538^2 ≈ 0.9098.

So 0.9098.

So 2.25 * 0.9098 ≈ 2.046.

Wait, but that's approximately 2.05.

But wait, the options are around 2.23, 2.25, etc. Hmm, that's different. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula: lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/(1 - v_r) ) when the source is moving away. If the source is moving towards us, it would be sqrt( (1 - v_r)/(1 + v_r) ), leading to a shorter wavelength (blueshift). But in this problem, the observed lambda is same for both stars.

Wait, Star_1's v_r is 0, so lambda_obs_1 = lambda_1_rest.

Star_2's v_r is 700 km/s. But if it's moving towards us, the observed lambda would be shorter, so lambda_obs_2 = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ).

But if both observed lambdas are the same, then lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), because Star_2 is moving away, which would cause lambda_obs_2 to be longer than lambda_2_rest. But if lambda_obs_1 and lambda_obs_2 are equal, then lambda_1_rest must be less than lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) ).

Wait, perhaps I need to correct the earlier part.

Let me re-express it.

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_1_rest [since v1=0]

lambda_obs_2 = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) [if Star_2 is moving away]

Since lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2,

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But from Wien's law, lambda_1_rest = b / T1, lambda_2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which leads to,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that's what I had earlier. So T2 is higher than T1. So earlier calculation is correct.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0237.

So T1 / T2 = 1/1.0237 ≈ 0.9766.

Wait, but then the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

So, (1.5)^2 = 2.25; (0.9766)^4 ≈ 0.9098.

2.25 * 0.9098 ≈ 2.046.

So L1 is about 2.05 times L2.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~2.25, but that's higher. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the star's velocities affecting the observed temperature. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternative approach: Maybe the stars' temperatures are the same because their observed peak wavelengths are the same, but that would ignore the Doppler effect. But that can't be right.

Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on the assumption that the stars are black bodies. So perhaps they used the observed parameters to compute the luminosity, but that's not correct because the observed flux takes into account Doppler shifts and distances.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not factoring in the Doppler shift when computing the luminosity. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem states, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of:"

Hmm, so maybe they are using the observed wavelengths to compute the luminosity, but that's complicated because the observed flux depends on Doppler shifts.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

If the stars are moving, their observed flux will change due to the Doppler effect and the changing solid angle (if they are moving towards or away). But in this case, the problem states that the peak wavelengths observed are the same for both stars, so their observed temperatures are the same.

Wait, but if the observed temperatures are the same, then T_obs_1 = T_obs_2.

Wait, how is observed temperature calculated? From the observed peak wavelength using Wien's law.

So, if both observed peak wavelengths are the same, then T_obs_1 = T_obs_2 = T_obs.

But the actual temperature of the stars is different because one is moving.

So, the actual temperature of Star_1 is T1, and when it's moving (if it's moving), the observed temperature would be different. But in this case, Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so T_obs_1 = T1.

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed temperature would be T_obs_2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )? Wait, no, because when a star is moving towards us, the observed temperature would be higher (blueshift), so T_obs = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) if moving away, but I think the Doppler shift formula affects the observed wavelength, which inversely relates to temperature.

Alternatively, using the Doppler formula for observed wavelength:

lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) )

But since T = b / lambda, the observed temperature is T_obs = T_source * sqrt( (1 - v_r) / (1 + v_r) )

Wait, let me think. Let's say the source emits at lambda_0 = b / T. If the source is moving away with velocity v, then the observed lambda_obs = lambda_0 * (1 + v/c) (approximate for small v). So,

T_obs = b / lambda_obs = (b / lambda_0) / (1 + v/c) = T / (1 + v/c)

So, T_obs = T * (1/(1 + v/c)) ≈ T (1 - v/c) for small v.

Wait, but earlier we used the exact formula with square roots. So perhaps the exact relation is:

lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c.

So, T_obs = (b / lambda_obs) = (b / lambda_source) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = T_source * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, T_obs = T_source * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

In our case, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so T_obs_1 = T1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, which is beta = 700e3 / 3e5e3) = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

Wait, but wait, the sign of beta depends on the direction. If Star_2 is moving away, beta is positive. If moving towards, beta is negative.

In the problem statement, Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but the problem doesn't specify direction. So perhaps we should take it as moving away, so beta is positive.

So, for Star_2:

T_obs_2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But we know that T_obs_1 = T_obs_2, because the observed peak wavelengths are the same.

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is what I had earlier. So T2 is larger than T1.

Now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4 pi R² sigma T^4.

So, L1 = 4 pi R1² sigma T1^4

L2 = 4 pi R2² sigma T2^4

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1² / R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1 / T2)^4.

We have T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^2.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^2.

Now, beta = 700e3 / 3e5e3 = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

Compute (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (1 - 0.0233333)/(1 + 0.0233333) = (0.9766667)/(1.0233333) ≈ 0.9538.

So, [0.9538]^2 ≈ 0.9098.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9098 ≈ 2.046.

Which is approximately 2.05.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but wait, none of the options are near 2.05. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me compute (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) more accurately.

beta = 700 km/s, so v = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

beta = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333333.

1 - beta = 0.976666667.

1 + beta = 1.023333333.

(1 - beta) / (1 + beta) = (0.976666667) / (1.023333333) = ?

Let me compute this division:

1.023333333 × 0.954 ≈ 0.976666667.

Wait, perhaps exact value is better calculated.

Let me compute 976666667 / 1023333333 = ?

Wait, perhaps compute 0.976666667 divided by 1.023333333.

Wait, 0.976666667 ≈ 293/300.

1.023333333 ≈ 307/300.

So, 293/300 divided by 307/300 = 293/307 ≈ 0.95439739.

So,

[ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2 = (0.95439739)^2 ≈ 0.9107.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9107 ≈ 2.049.

Hmm, so approximately 2.05.

But the options given are:

A) ~2.25,

B) ~2.32,

C) ~2.35,

D) ~2.23.

None of these are close to 2.05. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler effect is not considered because the problem says the stars' luminosities are computed as black bodies, but perhaps the observed wavelengths are used to determine their temperatures. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Since both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, their observed temperatures are the same.

So, T_obs_1 = T_obs_2.

But T_obs is related to the actual temperature and the velocity.

So,

T_obs = T * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )

For Star_1, beta is zero, so T_obs_1 = T1.

For Star_2, T_obs_2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )

Since T_obs_1 = T_obs_2,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )

Which leads to T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Same as before.

So, same result.

Hmm, but the problem is that I get L1/L2 ≈2.05, but the options are higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect and assume the same temperature. That would give L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1)^4 = 2.25, which is option A.

But then why is the radial velocity information given? It would be redundant. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another point: The problem says they 'computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of...'. So perhaps the calculation is done using their actual parameters, not the observed ones.

Wait, but the problem states that they used the observed wavelengths to compute luminosity. Because the problem says, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity".

Wait, no, perhaps they observed the wavelengths and used that to get the temperature, but the actual temperature is different due to Doppler.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think differently.

Wait, another approach: The luminosity of a star as observed from Earth is affected by the Doppler effect. So the observed flux F is related to the intrinsic flux F0 by (1 + v_r/c)^2. Because the number of photons received per unit time decreases if the star is moving away, and the photons are redshifted, each photon having lower energy.

Wait, the observed flux F is F0 * (1 + v_r/c)^{-2}.

But luminosity L is the intrinsic property, not the observed flux. So perhaps the problem is considering the actual luminosities, not the observed fluxes.

Hmm, but the problem states that they computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. So perhaps they used the observed wavelengths to compute the temperature, but the actual luminosity depends on actual R and T.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the observed temperatures are the same. So T_obs_1 = T_obs_2.

But the actual temperatures are T1 and T2.

The observed temperature is T_obs = T * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) [if the star is moving away].

So for Star_1, T_obs_1 = T1. Because v_r =0.

For Star_2, T_obs_2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Since T_obs_1 = T_obs_2,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

As before.

So the luminosity of each star is L = 4 pi R² sigma T^4.

So,

L1 = 4 pi (1.5 R2)^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (T1^4) / (T2^4) )

But T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2

We already calculated [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ] ≈ 0.95439739, so squared is approximately 0.9107.

So,

2.25 * 0.9107 ≈ 2.049. So around 2.05.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect. Let's see what happens then.

If we ignore the Doppler effect, then the stars have the same T.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1)^4 = 2.25, which is option A.

But why would the problem give the radial velocities then? Because the radial velocities are given, but if we ignore them, it's option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocities are given to find the actual temperatures.

But in this problem, perhaps the Doppler effect doesn't affect the calculation because the observed wavelength is same, so the temperatures are same.

Wait, but earlier analysis shows that the actual temperatures are different.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler effect to be considered, but I'm not getting the right answer. So maybe I should re-calculate the ratio more accurately.

Let me compute [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2.

beta = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333333.

Wait, wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s.

Wait, beta = 700,000 / 3e8 = 0.0023333333.

Wait, earlier I thought beta was 0.02333, but that's incorrect. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, which is 0.7e6 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So beta is 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait no, 700,000 / 300,000,000 is 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

Yes, so beta is approximately 0.023333.

So, 1 - beta = 0.9766667,

1 + beta = 1.0233333.

The ratio (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = 0.9766667 / 1.0233333.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

Divide 0.9766667 by 1.0233333.

Let me compute 9766667 / 10233333.

Approximately, 9766667 ÷ 10233333 ≈ 0.954399.

So,

[ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2 = (0.954399)^2 ≈ 0.9108.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9108 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9108 = 2.049.

Hmm, that's about 2.05, but the options are higher. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the Doppler shift in the observed flux when computing luminosity.

Wait, the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, but the observed flux F is affected by the Doppler shift.

The flux F is given by F = L / (4 pi d^2) * ( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )^(n), where n accounts for the Doppler effect on photon energy and number. For a star moving with velocity v, the observed flux is F = F0 * (1 + v/c)^{-2}.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula for Doppler shift affecting luminosity.

Alternatively, the flux from a star moving with velocity v is affected by both the area (if it's moving towards or away) and the energy of the photons.

The number of photons per unit time received is proportional to (1/(1 + v/c)) due to time dilation and the area change. The energy of each photon is also shifted by 1/(1 + v/c) because of the redshift (if moving away).

Wait, so the flux F is F0 * (1 + v/c)^{-1} * (1 + v/c)^{-1} = F0 * (1 + v/c)^{-2}.

So, the observed flux F_obs = F0 * (1 + v_r / c )^{-2}.

But the luminosity L is the intrinsic luminosity, which is related to the flux at the star's surface.

Wait, but when computing the luminosity from the observed flux, you need to account for the Doppler effect. But the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming the stars are black bodies. So perhaps they used the observed flux and adjusted it for Doppler shift to find the intrinsic luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the observed peak wavelength to compute the temperature, but the actual radius and temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not accounting for the Doppler shift when computing the luminosity. So the astronomers see the same peak wavelength, and assume that the stars have the same temperature.

In that case, T1 = T2.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * 1 = 2.25, option A.

But that doesn't use the radial velocity info, which is given in the problem. So perhaps that's not the intended approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward: The luminosity of a star is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

But if the observed wavelength is the same for both, then T_obs is the same. But the actual luminosity would depend on the actual T and R.

Wait, but without knowing the actual T, you can't compute L. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the radial velocity is a red herring, and the intended solution is to assume same T, leading to option A.

But why is the radial velocity given if it's a red herring?

Another approach: The problem says the stars have the same observed peak wavelength, so their observed temperatures are the same. But the actual temperature of each star is different.

But if the problem assumes that the black body radiation is based on the observed parameters, then the luminosity would be computed using the observed R and T.

Wait, but we don't know the actual radius and temperature. Hmm.

Wait, but in reality, the radius is known, because it's given (Star_1 is 1.5 times Star_2's radius). So R1 = 1.5 R2.

But the temperature is calculated from the observed peak wavelength using Wien's law. So T_obs = b / lambda_obs.

Since both have the same lambda_obs, T_obs is the same.

Thus, when computing luminosity, perhaps you would use T_obs and R.

So, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T_obs^4,

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T_obs^4.

Thus, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So option A.

But that ignores the actual Doppler shift. So perhaps that's the intended approach.

So the correct answer would be A) ~2.25.

But why is the radial velocity given? Because the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which would affect the observed temperature if not accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the actual temperature of each star based on the observed wavelength, considering their velocities.

So, for Star_1, v1 = 0, so T1_obs = b / lambda_obs.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s.

So, the actual temperature T2 is such that the observed temperature T2_obs = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = T1_obs.

So,

T2 = T1_obs / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = T1_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But T1_obs is the same as the observed temperature of Star_1, which is T1 = b/lambda_obs.

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Thus, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

= (1.5)^2 * (1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ))^4.

= 2.25 * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^2.

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before, leading to approximately 2.05.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) correctly.

beta = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

beta = 700000 / 300000000 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

(1 + beta) = 1.0233333,

(1 - beta) = 0.9766667.

So,

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1.0233333) / (0.9766667) ≈ 1.048.

So,

sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ≈ sqrt(1.048) ≈ 1.0237.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = (1 / 1.0237)^4 ≈ (0.9766)^4.

What's 0.9766^2? Approximately 0.9538.

0.9538^2: Let's compute 0.9538 * 0.9538.

= (0.95)^2 + 2*(0.95)*(0.0038) + (0.0038)^2.

≈ 0.9025 + 0.00702 + 0.00001444 ≈ 0.9095.

So,

(0.9766)^4 ≈ 0.9095.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9095 ≈ 2.049.

But this isn't close to any of the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity calculation because it's using the rest frame parameters. So, perhaps the stars' luminosities are based on their rest frame R and T, ignoring the observed shift.

But if that's the case, and the observed lambda is same, then their rest frame lambdas are same only if their temperatures are same, but considering their velocities, the actual temperatures would differ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the Doppler shift not to affect the luminosity ratio. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the Doppler shift effect on temperature at all, and simply assumes that the same observed peak wavelength implies same temperature, so T1=T2.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 → option A.

But why is the radial velocity given? It might be a distraction. So perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2 more accurately.

beta = 700 km/s → 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

beta = 700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333333.

So,

1 - beta = 0.976666667,

1 + beta = 1.023333333.

The ratio (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = 0.976666667 / 1.023333333.

Let me compute this division precisely.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000000000 to eliminate decimals:

976666667 / 1023333333.

Compute this division:

976666667 ÷ 1023333333 ≈ 0.954397.

So,

(1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ≈ 0.954397.

Square that: (0.954397)^2.

Compute:

0.954397 * 0.954397.

= (0.95 + 0.004397)^2.

= 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.004397 + (0.004397)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.0083146 + 0.00001933.

≈ 0.9025 + 0.0083146 ≈ 0.9108146 + 0.00001933 ≈ 0.9108339.

So,

[ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2 ≈ 0.9108339.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9108339 ≈ 2.049.

Hmm, 2.049 is around 2.05. None of the options match. So perhaps the intended solution is option D) ~2.23, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate without approximating beta as 0.023333.

Let me compute beta exactly.

v = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

beta = 700000 / 3e8 = 700000 / 300000000 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.02333333333.

Now, let's compute (1 - beta) and (1 + beta):

1 - beta = 293/300 = 0.976666666...

1 + beta = 307/300 ≈ 1.02333333333.

So,

(1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (293/300) / (307/300) = 293/307.

293/307 = approximately 0.95439739.

So,

(293/307)^2 = (293^2)/(307^2).

Compute 293^2 = (300 -7)^2 = 90000 - 4200 +49 = 85849.

307^2 = (300 +7)^2 = 90000 +4200 +49= 94249.

So,

(293/307)^2 = 85849 / 94249 ≈ 0.91082.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91082 ≈ 2.049.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects an exact calculation without approximating beta.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach is that the radial velocities are irrelevant, and the correct answer is option A.

But given that, I'm not sure. Perhaps the problem intended us to ignore the Doppler shift and consider same T.

Thus, the answer would be A) ~2.25.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler effect to be considered, leading to a different calculation.

Wait, another possibility: The luminosity is the intrinsic luminosity, so the Doppler shift doesn't affect it. So the problem is more about the observed flux.

Wait, when a star moves towards us, the observed flux increases due to the Doppler boosting. The formula for flux from a moving black body is F = F0 * (1 + v/c), where F0 is the flux at rest.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think about flux.

Flux F is energy per unit area per unit time. For a source moving with velocity v towards the observer, the flux increases. The formula is F = F0 * (1 + v/c), where v is positive when moving towards.

But F is also related to the luminosity by F = L/(4 pi d^2), where d is the distance.

But in this problem, the luminosities are computed using the black body assumption.

Hmm, perhaps the astronomers calculate the luminosity using the observed flux, which has been Doppler shifted.

So,

L = 4 pi d^2 F_obs.

But F_obs = F0 * (1 + v_r/c).

But F0 is the flux at rest, which is L/(4 pi d^2).

So,

F_obs = L/(4 pi d^2) * (1 + v_r/c).

So,

L = 4 pi d^2 F_obs = L * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, that doesn't make sense. It implies L = L * (1 + v_r/c), which can't be right unless v_r=0.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps it's best to proceed with the initial approach and accept that the correct ratio is ~2.05, but since it's not an option, the intended answer is option A) ~2.25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The observed peak wavelengths of the stars are the same, implying the same observed temperature. However, the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s, which introduces a Doppler effect that must be considered.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Observed Temperature Equality**:  
   Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the observed temperatures of both stars are equal, i.e., \( T_{\text{obs,1}} = T_{\text{obs,2}} \). Using Wien's law, the observed temperature is related to the intrinsic temperature and radial velocity by:  
   \[
   T_{\text{obs}} = T \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
   \]  
   where \( \beta = v/c \) and \( v \) is the radial velocity.

2. **Relating Intrinsic Temperatures**:  
   For Star_1 (\( v_r = 0 \)), \( T_{\text{obs,1}} = T_1 \). For Star_2 (\( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), \( T_{\text{obs,2}} = T_2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}} \). Since \( T_{\text{obs,1}} = T_{\text{obs,2}} \), it follows that:  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
   \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   The ratio of the luminosities is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]  
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}} \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}}\right)^4
   \]  
   Simplifying further:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}\right)^2
   \]

4. **Calculating the Doppler Factor**:  
   For \( \beta = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), \( \beta = \frac{700,000}{300,000,000} \approx 0.02333 \).  
   Compute \( \frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta} = \frac{0.9766667}{1.0233333} \approx 0.954397
   \]  
   Squaring this:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}\right)^2 \approx 0.9108
   \]  
   Substituting back:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9108 \approx 2.049
   \]

5. **Options Analysis**:  
   The calculated ratio \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.05 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the Doppler effect is ignored and the stars are assumed to have the same intrinsic temperature (\( T_1 = T_2 \)), the luminosity ratio simplifies to:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]  
   This matches **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
While the Doppler effect introduces a slight correction, the problem likely intends for the Doppler effect to be ignored, leading to the simplest solution where the luminosity ratio is \( 2.25 \). This corresponds to **Option A**.
