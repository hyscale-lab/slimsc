Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm. 

Wait, P is a vector operator, so I think it's composed of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of those components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! Because each component of angular momentum (or spin) in quantum mechanics is often represented by Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. That means n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), wait no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, any direction in the x-z plane would have φ = 0 or π? Or more accurately, if the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) would be 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe we just pick φ=0 for simplicity. So the direction vector n is along (x,0,z), so maybe n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps n is parametrized as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) or something like that. I might need to figure that out.

The operator P is along n, so the operator we're considering is P·n, which would be P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n is any vector in that plane. So for generality, n can be written as (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1, because it's a unit vector. Alternatively, maybe using spherical coordinates, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since it's in the x-z plane, let's say n makes an angle θ with the x-axis, so n would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Wait, no, wait: maybe the angle is with the z-axis. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Let me think: in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, θ would be 0 or π/2? No, wait, if θ is 0, it's along positive z, θ=π/2 is in the x-y plane. Wait, no—no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ (azimuthal) is 0 or π. But the polar angle θ would vary between 0 and π/2. Because if θ is 0, it's along +z; if θ is π/2, it's in the x-y plane. Wait, but in the x-z plane, the polar angle would be 0 or π/2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: if the vector is in the x-z plane, then it's a combination of x and z. So the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So for a vector in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or π, and θ can be anything between 0 and π/2. So n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because as θ increases from 0 to π/2, the vector moves from +z to +x. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Because when θ is 0, the vector is along +z: (0,0,1). When θ is π/2, it's along +x: (1,0,0). So the components would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ. So for φ=0, the vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So yes, that's correct.

So the operator P·n would be P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ. Because n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

So, the operator P·n is (sinθ) * P_x + (cosθ) * P_z.

Each of P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix.

So let's write out each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P·n becomes (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix.

First, sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is:

[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

Then, cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is:

[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Add them together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the entire operator P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [ (2)(1/2) ) ]? Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation after scaling is:

( (ħ/2) * M ) * |ψ> = (ħ/2) * |ψ>

So dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get:

M |ψ> = |ψ>, where M is the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So we have the matrix equation:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [ a; b ]

Which gives the system of equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rewrite these equations.

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0

So, equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (A)
Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0 → equation (B)

We can solve this system for a and b.

Let me write equation A as: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] * b

Similarly, equation B: sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] * b

So, both expressions for a must be equal.

So [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] * b = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] * b → assuming b ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by b.

So,

- sinθ / (cosθ -1) = (cosθ +1)/ sinθ

Multiply both sides by (cosθ -1) and sinθ:

- sinθ * sinθ = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1)

Left side: - sin²θ

Right side: (cos^2θ -1) → which is - sin²θ, since cos^2 + sin^2 =1 → cos^2 -1= - sin^2.

So,

- sin²θ = - sin²θ → which holds true.

So the equations are consistent, and the solution is a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] * b. Or alternatively, the ratio a/b is (cosθ +1)/(sinθ )

But let's write in terms of a and b. Let's pick b as a parameter, say b =1, so a = (cosθ +1)/ sinθ.

Wait, but wait: (cosθ +1) is in the numerator, and sinθ in the denominator.

Let me compute a in terms of b:

a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] * b

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (cosθ +1), sinθ ]^T ?

Wait, no, because a is (cosθ +1)/ sinθ multiplied by b. So if we let b =1, then a = (cosθ +1)/ sinθ.

Wait, but that's only valid if sinθ is not zero. Hmm, but if sinθ is zero, then θ is 0 or π, which would make n along +z or -z. Let me think: when θ=0, n is along +z. Then P·n becomes P_z. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the eigenvector would be the spin-up state along z, which is (1,0). But according to the equation, when θ=0, sinθ=0, so we can't use that approach. So perhaps we need to handle that case separately.

But in this problem, n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so θ can be any angle between 0 and π/2, I guess. So sinθ isn't zero. So we can proceed.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (cosθ +1), sinθ ].

But wait, let's check the equations again. Let me compute:

a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] * b.

So the vector is [ (cosθ +1), sinθ ] multiplied by 1/sinθ, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write in terms of a ratio.

Alternatively, let me represent the eigenvector as:

[ a ]
[ b ]

So from equation A: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But sinθ / (1 - cosθ) can be simplified. Let me think: 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2).

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write it as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, wait, because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So if I set b= sin(theta/2), then a= cos(theta/2). So the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that makes sense. Because then a = cos(theta/2), b= sin(theta/2). Then the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2), which matches the earlier expression.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, let me check. Let me plug these into equation A:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Substituting a= cos(theta/2), b= sin(theta/2):

(cosθ -1) cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = ?

Hmm. Let me compute each term.

Let me compute cosθ in terms of theta/2: cosθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2) - 1.

So cosθ -1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 -1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2) - 2 = 2( cos^2(theta/2) -1 ) = -2 sin^2(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting into the equation:

( -2 sin^2(theta/2) ) * cos(theta/2) + ( 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) * sin(theta/2) = ?

Let's compute each term:

First term: -2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Second term: 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Adding them together: (-2 +2 ) sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2) )= 0. So yes, it holds.

So the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is indeed an eigenvector.

Now, what about the eigenvalue? Earlier, we divided by ħ/2, so the eigenvalue is 1.

Wait, the original equation after scaling was M |ψ> = |ψ>, with M being the matrix (ħ/2) * the matrix, but we scaled it down by ħ/2, so the eigenvalue of 1 corresponds to the original eigenvalue of ħ/2, which matches the question.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But we need to normalize it. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Compute |a|^2 + |b|^2: [cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2)] =1. So it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but wait, the options are presented as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So option C is exactly that.

But wait, I had P·n = (ħ/2) times the matrix, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvector we found is for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is listed as "(\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))" which matches exactly.

But wait, let me check if any other options could be correct. For example, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by ħ and the terms. But why would the eigenvector have those factors? That would imply an unnormalized vector scaled by ħ, which doesn't make sense for a normalized eigenvector. Because the eigenvalues are in units of ħ, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless. So options A and D have terms multiplied by ħ, which is incorrect. So they can be eliminated.

Option B has cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). But in our case, the eigenvector depends on theta/2, not theta. So option B is for a different scenario, perhaps for spin-1 in a different basis.

So the correct choice is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is composed of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle $\vec{n}$ makes with the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]
Using the given components:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right].
\]
Simplifying the matrix:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\]
From these equations, the ratio of $a$ to $b$ is found to be:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:
\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Since $\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1$, the vector is already normalized.

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ depends on $\theta$ and $\phi$, which does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$ matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$ includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
