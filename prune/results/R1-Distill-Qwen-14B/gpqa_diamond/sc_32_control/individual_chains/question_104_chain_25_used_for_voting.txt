Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is about how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, what do I remember about the RV method? The RV method detects the velocity of the star moving towards or away from us. The semi-amplitude of this velocity is given by the formula K = (v*sin i) / (1 + (M_p/M_s)^(1/3)), but wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (1 + sin i)) )

But since the planets are in circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, since the planet's mass is much less than the star's (Neptune is much lighter than the Sun), M_s + M_p is approximately M_s. So maybe I can simplify it.

Wait, but in this case, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is the same for both, and M_s is the same for both. So the K would be proportional to (M_p) / M_s^(1/3). But wait, no, M_p is in the numerator, and M_s is under a cube root in the denominator. Wait, let me get the formula right.

The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c T) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) )

But when M_p << M_s, it simplifies to K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_s^(2/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm remembering the exact formula. Alternatively, another approach is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period and the mass of the planet.

Wait, the formula I think is:

K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a way to relate the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. Since K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period? Or wait, maybe K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period. Because if the planet is farther away (longer period), the star's velocity would be smaller, so K would be smaller.

Wait, another way: The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is higher when the planet's orbital period is shorter. Because a shorter orbital period means the planet is closer, so the star's velocity is higher. So if Planet #2 has a larger shift (7 mA) than Planet #1 (5 mA), that would imply that Planet #2's star is moving more, which suggests it's orbiting a more massive planet or in a shorter period? Wait, no, the mass of the planet is the same (both Neptune-like), so the only variable left is the period.

Wait, but no, the mass of the planet affects the velocity. So if M_p is the same, and M_s is same, then K should be the same. But in this case, K is different. Oh wait, no, in this scenario, each planet is detected around a star, and each has the same mass, so M_p is same. So why are the K values different? Because the orbital periods are different. Oh, because the same M_p and M_s, but different periods.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for K. The formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p) * (1 - e²) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / P)^(1/3)

Wait, maybe a better approach is to derive the relation between K and P.

The formula for the semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (27 * (2π G)^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since e is zero (circular orbit) and M_p << M_s, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (27 * (2π G)^(1/3) ) / (c ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, because the other terms are constants here, since M_p and M_s are same for both planets, and sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, but if both are edge-on, then sin i is same). So, since K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes, we can write:

K1 / K2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_p2 / M_p1) * (P1)^(1/3) ) )? Wait, no, maybe I should think again.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)).

So:

K1 / K2 = ( (M_p1) / (P1^(1/3)) ) / ( (M_p2) / (P2^(1/3)) )

But in this case, M_p1 = M_p2 = M_neptune, so M_p cancels out.

So K1 / K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Which can be rewritten as (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

Wait, let me write it correctly. Since K = (constant) * (M_p) / (P^(1/3)).

So, K1 = C * M_p / (P1^(1/3)).

Similarly, K2 = C * M_p / (P2^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = [ (M_p / P1^(1/3)) ] / [ (M_p / P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) ).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Rearranging: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, but in the problem, the shifts are 5 and 7 mA. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

Wait, no, because the shift (in wavelength) is proportional to velocity, because the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.

Since the same spectral line is observed, the lambda is the same for both stars. So the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (K) is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts.

So, K1 = 5 mA, K2 =7 mA.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So, (K1/K2) = 5/7. Then, (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, from earlier, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2's period than P1. So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Oh wait, no. Wait, no, because earlier when I derived, I had:

K1/K2 = [ (P2/P1) ^ (1/3) ]

Wait no, earlier I think I made a mistake. Let me correct.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = ( (M_p1) / (P1^(1/3)) ) * ( P2^(1/3) / M_p2 )

Since M_p1 = M_p2, they cancel. So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) ).

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, K1/K2 =5/7.

So, (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 = 0.364 * P1.

Which means that P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, not longer.

But the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are given as A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, etc.

So the answer should be option A, ~0.36.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and their host stars have the same mass as the Sun. The RV method detects the Doppler shift of the spectral lines of the stars, with Planet #1 causing a shift of 5 milliangstroms and Planet #2 causing a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{M_p}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( M_p \) is the planet's mass and \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the planets have the same mass and the stars have the same mass, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \), the ratio is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Cubing this ratio gives:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, \( P_2 / P_1 \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
