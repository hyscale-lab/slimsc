Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3.

The host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but how does the star's mass affect the transit probability? Oh, right. The star's mass influences the planet's orbit. Wait, no, the transit probability is more about the size of the planet and the star. Because the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, I think. But wait, more accurately, it's the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size—the larger the planet relative to the star, the higher the chance of a transit because the area blocked is larger, making it more likely to catch the transit.

But wait, that's not the whole story. There's also the orbital distance involved. The probability of a transit also depends on the size of the star's disk relative to the planet's orbital distance. The formula for the probability is something like (R_star / a)², where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet's orbital plane has to be aligned enough for it to pass in front of the star. So the further the planet is from the star (larger 'a'), the smaller the chance of a transit, because the star's disk is a smaller target in the sky relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, actually, the transit probability formula is (R_star / a)² * (something else). Let me think. I recall that the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for the transit. But for a given star and planet, the main factors would be the planet's size relative to the star and the orbital distance.

So, for each planet, I need to compute (R_planet / R_star)^2 times (1 / (a^2)) or something similar. Wait, maybe it's (R_star / a)^2 times (R_planet / R_star)^2? Or perhaps it's the product of both ratios.

Wait, the actual formula for the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_star / a)^2 * ( (R_planet + R_star) / R_star )^2 * (other factors), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think the main factors are: the planet's size relative to the star (so R_planet / R_star) and the orbital distance (a) such that a is larger, the probability is lower.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2, where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius, and a is semi-major axis. Because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area where the planet can transit is a circle of diameter a in front of it. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Wait, the transit probability is based on the alignment of the orbit. The chance is the ratio of the size of the star's disk to the size of the planet's orbit (as seen from Earth), so it's (R_star / (a * sin i)), where i is the inclination. But since we're considering the probability that i is close enough to 90 degrees, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Because the area where the planet can pass in front is π(R_star)^2, and the area of the possible orbital plane is something like 2πa (if I'm getting this right?), but wait, I'm getting confused. Another way: the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2 times (R_planet / R_star)^2. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability can be approximated by ( (R_p + R_s)/ (a) )^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. So the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a)^2. But also, the planet has to be big enough to cause a noticeable dip. So the overall probability depends on (R_p^2) * (R_s^2 / a^2). Because the depth of the transit is (R_p / R_s)^2, but the probability of it transiting is (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, but maybe I can proceed with the given information.

Given that both stars have the same radius, R_s, so R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So for each planet, the probability of transit would be proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. But since R_p is the same for both planets because their masses are the same? Wait, no. Wait, the question says they have the same minimum masses. But mass doesn't directly determine radius. Oh, but the question says that both planets have Earth-like masses, but I think in reality, same mass doesn't mean same radius because gas giants have lower density. But the question says 'Earth-like', which probably implies similar radii. So let's assume R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

So the transit probability for each planet would be proportional to (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s^2 / a^2) = (R_p^2) / a^2.

So P1 ∝ (R_p^2) / a1^2, and P2 ∝ (R_p^2) / a2^2.

Since R_p is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a^2.

So which planet has a smaller a, meaning higher P?

Wait, but the a is the semi-major axis. The orbital period is given, so can we relate a to the period? Using Kepler's third law, which states that a^3 is proportional to (M_star) * P^2. Because the formula is a^3 = (G(M_star + m_planet) * P^2)/(4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate a^3 ∝ M_star * P^2.

So a = [ M_star * P^2 ]^(1/3).

Wait, but M_star is for each planet's host. Let's write a1 and a2.

a1^3 = (M1 * P1²) / (4π² G)
a2^3 = (M2 * P2²) / (4π² G)

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²)

From the question: M1 = 2 * M2, and P1 = P2 / 3.

So M1 = 2 M2, P1 = (P2)/3.

Substituting: (a1^3)/(a2^3) = (2 M2 / M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) / P2^2 )

Wait, that's (2) * ( (P2² / 9) ) / P2² ) → 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3): 2 is 2, 9 is 3². So cube root of 2/(3²) is (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3).

Hmm, approximately, cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 ≈ 0.605 * a2.

Wait, but that's a1 being smaller than a2, since a1 is for the planet with shorter period and more massive star.

So since a1 is smaller than a2, the transit probability for planet 1 would be higher because probability is proportional to 1/a². So P1 is (a2/a1)^2 times P2.

Because P1 ∝ 1/a1², P2 ∝ 1/a2². So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2²)/(a1²) = (a2/a1)^2.

From above, a1/a2 ≈ 0.605 → a2/a1 ≈ 1.653. So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.653)^2 ≈ 2.73.

So P1 is approximately 2.73 times higher than P2.

Wait, but let me double-check this calculation.

a1^3 = (M1 * P1²) / (4pi² G)
a2^3 = (M2 * P2²) / (4pi² G)

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²) = (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2² ) → 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Which is the same as a1 = a2 * (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = a2 * (2^(1/3)) / (3^(2/3)).

Because 9 is 3², so cube root of 9 is 3^(2/3).

So a1 = a2 * (2^(1/3)/3^(2/3)).

So the ratio a2/a1 = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3).

Compute this numerically. Let's compute the exponents.

3^(2/3) is the cube root of 3 squared, which is cube root of 9 ≈ 2.08.

2^(1/3) is cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26.

So 2.08 / 1.26 ≈ 1.653.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1.653.

Thus, the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.653)^2 ≈ 2.73.

So Planet_1 has about 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but the options say:

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the transit probability is higher for the planet with smaller a, because 1/a² is larger. So since a1 is smaller, P1 is larger. So the transit probability is higher for Planet_1, which has a shorter period and more massive star.

So the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting. So the correct observation choice is Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

Option D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Yes, that's what I calculated.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{a^2}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of its orbit. Since both planets have the same Earth-like mass, we assume their radii are similar (\(R_{p1} \approx R_{p2}\)), so the probability depends primarily on the semi-major axis \(a\).

### Step 1: Relating orbital period and semi-major axis
Using Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the host star's mass \(M_s\) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Thus, the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{9^{1/3}} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{3^{2/3}}
\]

Approximating:
\[
2^{1/3} \approx 1.26, \quad 3^{2/3} \approx 2.08 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Comparing transit probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a^2\). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.653\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \approx (1.653)^2 \approx 2.73
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
