Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that's when the particles don't lose energy, right? So the collision is perfectly elastic.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ0 = 90°, δ1 =67°, δ2=55, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. Oh wait, the units aren't specified for δ2, but I think they must be degrees as well. The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we're only considering up to δ4.

I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. I remember that the scattering amplitude has both real and imaginary parts, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation. Oh right! The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum involving the phase shifts. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (a_l (4π/2l+1) (sin(lθ + δ_l) ) / (sin θ) ), where a_l is the scattering length for each angular momentum l. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh right, when θ is zero, because that's along the beam. So I think that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 might relate to the phase shifts in a specific way.

I recall that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the optical theorem. The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The theorem states that Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total, but wait, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Because I don't have the cross-section given directly. Oh wait, wait. Another approach: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (1/(2k)) times the sum of (a_l (4π/(2l+1)) ) multiplied by sin(2δ_l), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think the imaginary part for each l is (a_l sin δ_l )/(k), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula again. Oh, right! The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) in terms of partial waves is given by:

f(θ, φ) = ∑ [ ( (4π/(2l + 1)) ) * (a_l e^{i δ_l} ) * P_l(cosθ) ) ]

But when we take the imaginary part, it would involve the sine terms. So for each l, the imaginary part would be Im(f) = (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but since the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction, that's θ=0. So cosθ = 1. Hmm, but P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. So for each l, the contribution would be (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin δ_l * 1.

Wait, but do I have a_l? No, the problem gives me the phase shifts δ_l, but a_l is related to the scattering length, which isn't provided. Hmm, that's a problem. Oh wait, I think for electrons, the scattering length a_l is related to the phase shift δ_l by the formula a_l = (k/(2π)) * (sin δ_l) / (δ_l'), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the relation for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts.

Wait, wait. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(k,θ) = ∑ [ ( (4π/(2l + 1)) ) * (a_l e^{i δ_l} ) * P_l(cosθ) ) ]. The imaginary part Im(f) is then the imaginary part of this sum. So for each term, the imaginary part is (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ).

But without knowing a_l, how can I proceed? Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The question says to calculate the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. So for θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So Im(f(0)) = ∑ [ (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin(δ_l) ) ].

But again, without a_l, I can't compute this. So maybe I'm missing a key relation. Oh wait, the problem states that it's about the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here unless it's about the relation between a_l and δ_l.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the total cross-section comes into play. The total cross-section σ_total is given by ∑ (4π/(k^2)) |a_l|^2 ( (2l + 1)/(4π) )^2 ) )? Or wait, more accurately, the total cross-section is the sum over l of ( (4π/(2l+1)) )^2 |a_l|^2 (some factors). Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I remember that the scattering length a_l is related to the phase shift δ_l by the formula:

a_l = (k/(2π)) * [ (sin δ_l) / (δ_l) ) ]

But wait, that's an approximation, isn't it? Or maybe it's more precise to say that for small phase shifts, δ_l is small, and a_l ≈ (k/(2π)) * (sin δ_l) / δ_l, but that's only valid for δ_l << 1. But in this problem, the phase shifts are quite large: δ0 is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians, so that's not small. So perhaps that formula isn't applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_l = (k/(2π)) [ (sin δ_l) / ( δ_l + ... ) ] but I'm not sure. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (k/(4π)) times the total cross-section. So, if I could compute the total cross-section, then I can find Im(f(0)).

But how do I compute the total cross-section? The total cross-section σ_total is the sum over all l of ( 4π/(k^2) ) * |a_l|^2 * ( (2l + 1)/(4π) )^2 ). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, the total cross-section is the sum over l of ( (4π/(2l + 1)) )^2 |a_l|^2 (1/(k^2)) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the total cross-section is given by the optical theorem, which states that σ_total = 4π/k^2 Im(f(0)). So if I can find Im(f(0)), then I can find σ_total, but that's a bit circular.

Wait, but the problem asks for the Im(f(0)), so perhaps we don't need to compute σ_total. Maybe there's a different way.

Wait, perhaps the scattering amplitude f has a relation to the phase shifts. The formula for f is:

f(θ, φ) = ∑ [ (4π/(2l + 1)) a_l e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ] / (k)

Wait, but then the imaginary part would be the sum of (4π/(2l + 1)) a_l sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) / k.

At θ=0, P_l(1) = 1, so:

Im(f(0)) = [4π/(k)] ∑ [ (a_l sin δ_l) / (2l + 1) ) ]

But again, without knowing a_l, how do I proceed? I'm stuck here.

Wait, but perhaps a_l is known in terms of the phase shifts. Let's think: the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude connects a_l and δ_l. Another relation I remember is that a_l = (k/(2π)) [ (sin δ_l) / (δ_l + ... ) ] but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps the formula for a_l in terms of the phase shift is:

a_l = (k/(2π)) ( (sin δ_l)/(δ_l) )

But this is only valid when δ_l is small, which isn't the case here. So maybe this approach isn't applicable.

Wait, another approach: for each partial wave, the relation between a_l and δ_l is given by:

a_l = (k/(2π)) ( (sin δ_l ) / (δ_l ) )

Wait, but again, this is an approximation for small δ_l. So in our case, since δ0 is 90 degrees (which is π/2 radians), this approach may not work.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. The problem gives me the phase shifts, but the question is about the scattering amplitude along the incident direction, which is θ=0. So perhaps the imaginary part is just the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

Wait, another thought: the imaginary part of the amplitude at θ=0 is (k/(4π)) times the sum of (sin 2δ_l ) * something. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that directly relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the sum of the phase shifts.

Wait, I think I remember that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is given by:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * Σ [ (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin δ_l ]

But again, without a_l, this doesn't help. Wait, but perhaps the sum over l of (a_l sin δ_l) is related to the scattering length.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the phase shifts is directly related to the imaginary part. Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the scattering amplitude for each angular momentum channel. Each l contributes a term to the scattering amplitude. For each l, the scattering amplitude f_l is (4π/(2l + 1)) a_l e^{i δ_l}.

The imaginary part of f_l is (4π/(2l + 1)) a_l sin δ_l.

But again, without knowing a_l, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to use a simpler formula, like the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factor. Maybe the sum of the phase shifts δ_l is equal to the argument of the exponential in the scattering amplitude.

Wait, another approach: the total scattering amplitude is a sum over l of (4π/(2l+1)) a_l ( sin(δ_l) / (k) ) P_l(cosθ) multiplied by something. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula that gives the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts. Oh, right! The Born approximation gives f(k,θ) ≈ ( (4π)/(k) ) ( a e^{i δ} ), but that's for the s-wave only (l=0). But the problem here includes multiple phase shifts.

Wait, in the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ ( (4π/(2l + 1)) a_l e^{i δ_l} ) P_l(cosθ) / k

So at θ=0, P_l(1) =1, so f(0) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (4π a_l e^{i δ_l} )/(k (2l + 1) )

The imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = ∑ (4π a_l sin δ_l )/(k (2l + 1) )

But again, without a_l, this doesn't help.

Wait, but perhaps the question is only asking about the contribution from each partial wave, and the a_l are given by a_l = (k/(2π)) ( sin δ_l ) / (δ_l + ... ) but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a specific approximation where a_l is taken as 1, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the key is to note that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the sum of (k/(2π)) ( sin(2 δ_l) ) / (2l +1 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the total cross-section σ_total is given by the sum over l of ( (4π/(2l +1)) )^2 |a_l|^2 (1/(k^2)) ), but without knowing a_l, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that all phase shifts beyond a certain point (like l=4) are zero, and that I'm to sum up the contributions from l=0 to 4. But then again, without knowing a_l, I can't compute the sum.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the relation between the scattering length a_l and the phase shift δ_l. The formula is a_l = (1/k) [ (sin δ_l) / (δ_l) ) ] ? Wait, no, that would be for small δ_l. Because when δ_l is small, sin δ_l ≈ δ_l, so a_l ≈ (1/k) ( δ_l / δ_l ) = 1/k. But that's for small angles.

But in our case, δ0 is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians, so that's not small. So maybe that's not applicable.

Hmm, maybe the problem is only expecting me to sum the given phase shifts and multiply by some factor. Let's see: the given phase shifts are for l=0 to 4. So δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13. Wait, but what about the units? Are they in degrees or radians? The question shows degrees (with the degree symbol), so we'll need to convert them to radians for calculations.

Wait, but how does that tie into the scattering amplitude? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the sum over l of ( (k/(2π)) sin(2 δ_l) ) / (2l + 1) ).

Wait, I'm not sure but let's think. If I can find a formula that directly relates the phase shifts to Im(f(0)), that would help. Let me try to think.

In the partial wave expansion:

f(k,θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (4π a_l)/(k (2l+1)) ) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ)

The imaginary part is Im(f) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (4π a_l sin δ_l)/(k (2l+1)) ) P_l(cosθ)

At θ=0, P_l(1) =1, so:

Im(f(0)) = sum (4π a_l sin δ_l )/(k (2l+1) )

But again, without a_l, this doesn't compute.

Wait, perhaps the formula a_l = k (sin δ_l)/(2π δ_l) ) is correct, but I'm not certain. Let me assume that's the case, even if it's an approximation.

So a_l = (k (sin δ_l )) / (2 π δ_l )

Then, substituting into Im(f(0)):

Im(f(0)) = sum [ (4 π (k sin δ_l )/(2 π δ_l ) )) * ( sin δ_l ) ) / (k (2l+1) ) ]

Simplify:

= sum [ (4 π k sin δ_l )/(2 π δ_l ) ) * sin δ_l ) / (k (2l+1) ) ]

The k and π terms cancel:

= sum [ (4 sin^2 δ_l )/(2 δ_l (2l +1) ) ]

Simplify 4/2 = 2:

= sum [ (2 sin^2 δ_l )/( δ_l (2l +1) ) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure if this substitution is correct. Because as I thought earlier, this formula is an approximation for small δ_l, but our phase shifts are not small. So this approach might not be valid, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to proceed with it.

Wait, but if I proceed, let's compute each term.

Given: k is given as 50 MeV? Wait, no, the question states 50 MeV electrons. Wait, but what's the value of k in appropriate units?

Wait, k is the wave number. For electrons, the relation between energy E and k is E = (ħ² k²)/(2m). But I don't have the exact value of k here, but perhaps the problem is using natural units where ħ = c = 1, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question gives the phase shifts, but the options are in fm (femtometers), which is a unit of length. So perhaps k is in units of 1/fm.

Wait, let's compute k. E = 50 MeV. For electrons, the mass m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. So E=50 MeV is much larger than m_e c², so we can approximate k as sqrt(2m E)/ħ. But perhaps it's easier to compute in natural units where ħ = c = 1. Then, k ~ sqrt(2mE).

Wait, m_e in MeV/c² is 0.511 MeV/c². So 2mE = 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV = 51.1 MeV²/c².

Taking the square root: sqrt(51.1) MeV^{1/2}/c.

Wait, but I'm not confident about the units here. Maybe it's easier to just proceed with the formula.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the given phase shifts and sum their sine terms multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (k/(2π)) * something.

Wait, another approach: The Molière scattering formula. No, that's for small angle scattering. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: The question gives phase shifts δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. The options are in fm, which is a unit of length. So perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is something that would give a length, i.e., in units of fm.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length (or inverse momentum, depending on the system of units). So the imaginary part of f would have the same units.

So, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum [ ( (4π/(2l + 1)) a_l sin δ_l ) ]

But without knowing a_l, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the phase shift δ_l is related to the scattering length a_l via a_l = (k/(2π)) * ( sin δ_l ) / ( δ_l )

But again, this is only an approximation for small δ_l. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ ( sin(2 δ_l) )/( 2l + 1 ) ]

But I'm not sure. Let's try that.

Compute each term: sin(2 δ_l) / (2l +1)

For each l from 0 to 4:

l=0: δ0=90° → 2δ0=180° → sin(180)=0 → term=0/(1) = 0.

l=1: δ1=67° → 2δ1=134° → sin(134)= sin(180-46)=sin(46)= approx 0.7193 → term=0.7193/(3) ≈ 0.2398.

l=2: δ2=55 → 2δ=110 → sin(110)= sin(70) ≈ 0.9397 → term=0.9397 /5 ≈ 0.1879.

l=3: δ3=30 → 2δ=60 → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660 → term=0.8660/7 ≈ 0.1237.

l=4: δ4=13 → 2δ=26 → sin(26)≈0.4384 → term=0.4384/9≈0.0487.

Sum these terms:

0 + 0.2398 + 0.1879 + 0.1237 + 0.0487 ≈ 0.6001.

Multiply by (k/(2π)).

Wait, but what is k? The problem says 50 MeV electrons. Let's compute k in appropriate units.

In natural units (ħ = c = 1), the energy E is related to the momentum p (k is p/ħ, which is p when ħ=1) by E = p²/(2m). So p = sqrt(2 m E).

m_e is about 0.511 MeV/c². So E=50 MeV.

p = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV ) = sqrt( 51.1 ) MeV/c ≈ 7.15 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ) → since ħ=1 in natural units, k=7.15 MeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units conversion. Alternatively, perhaps in units where ħ=1 and c=1, then k is in MeV, and the inverse of k would be in fm (since 1 fm^-1 ≈ 100 MeV). Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and 1 MeV^{-1} is about 0.197e-15 m (since 1 MeV^{-1} ≈ 197 MeV * 1e-16 m → 1.97e-14 m? Wait, perhaps I got this wrong.

Wait, the Compton wavelength of the electron is about 2.426e-12 m, which is 2.426 fm, and ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm. So 1 MeV^{-1} = (ħ c)/ (MeV) ) ≈ 197.3 MeV fm / 1 MeV ) = 197.3 fm. So 1/(MeV) ~ 197 fm.

Hmm, not sure. But perhaps the formula I'm trying to use is Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ sin(2δ_l)/(2l +1) ]

So, if k is in MeV, then (k/(2π)) would have units of MeV. But Im(f(0)) is in fm, so perhaps I'm missing a factor involving 1/k or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * (sum [ (something) ] )

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm trying to use is incorrect. Maybe the sum should be multiplied by (k/(2π)) and then divided by k, making it a dimensionless quantity. I'm a bit stuck.

But let's proceed with the sum from earlier, which was approximately 0.6001.

Multiply by (k/(2π)).

Wait, but what's k in the right units? Let's calculate k in units of 1/fm.

Since 1 fm is about 0.00511 MeV^{-1} (because 1 MeV^{-1} ≈ 197.3 fm → 1 fm ≈ 1/197.3 MeV^{-1} ≈ 0.00505 MeV^{-1}).

Wait, more accurately, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. And since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, then 1 fm = (ħ c )/(197.33 MeV) → 1 fm ≈ (197.33 MeV fm)/(197.33 MeV) ) → 1 fm = 1 fm → which doesn't help. Alternatively, what's the value of k in 1/fm?

k is sqrt(2 m_e E). E is 50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV → m_e = 0.511 MeV / c².

So, E = 50 MeV.

p^2 = 2 m_e E c² → p = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV * 50 MeV * c² ) / c → (since E = pc² for high energies but not exactly... Wait, perhaps better to use natural units where ħ = c = 1. Then, E = p²/(2m).

So p = sqrt(2 m E) → p = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 MeV * 50 MeV ) → sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV.

So in natural units, k = p/ħ → p=7.15 MeV → k=7.15 MeV.

But in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, the scattering length a has units of 1/E, so 1/MeV. To convert a to fm, since 1 MeV^{-1} ≈ 0.197e-15 m = 0.197 fm, so 1/MeV ≈ 0.197 fm.

So, the formula would be Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ sin(2δ_l)/(2l +1) ] → but wait, the sum is dimensionless, k is in MeV, so (k/(2π)) would have units of MeV. But Im(f(0)) is in fm, so we need to multiply by a factor that converts MeV to fm. Since 1 MeV^{-1} ≈ 0.197 fm, then 1 MeV is (1/0.197 fm^{-1}) → but I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the correct approach is to use the relation between the scattering amplitude and the cross-section, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The options are in the order of 1e2 fm, so about 1e-13 meters. Let's see, the sum I calculated earlier was approximately 0.6001. If I multiply this by (k/(2π)), and then convert to fm.

k is 7.15 MeV. So (k/(2π)) = 7.15 / (6.283) ≈ 1.138 MeV.

But to get from MeV to fm, I use 1 MeV^{-1} ≈ 0.197 fm → so 1 MeV ≈ 1/(0.197 fm) ) → 1 MeV is about 5.076 fm^{-1}.

So:

(k/(2π)) ≈ 1.138 MeV → 1.138 * 5.076 fm^{-1} → ≈ 5.80 fm^{-1}.

But wait, I'm trying to get Im(f(0)) in fm, so I'm not sure if this approach is correct.

Wait, maybe the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum_{l} [ ( (4π a_l sin δ_l ) / (k (2l + 1) ) ) ]

But a_l is in units of fm, and k is in 1/fm (since k is 1/(wavelength), and wavelength is in fm). So a_l has units of fm, k has units of 1/fm, so (a_l / k) is (fm * fm) → fm²? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and look for the sum of phase shifts multiplied by (k/(2π)).

Wait, the sum of the phase shifts:

l=0: 90°, l=1:67, l=2:55, l=3:30, l=4:13.

Sum =90+67+55+30+13 = 255 degrees.

But 255 degrees is 255 * π/180 ≈4.45 radians.

But I'm not sure how to relate this to the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is (k/(4π)) * sum ( sin δ_l )

So sum sin δ_l:

sin(90)=1, sin(67)= approx 0.9205, sin(55)=0.8192, sin(30)=0.5, sin(13)=0.2249.

Sum=1 + 0.9205=1.9205 + 0.8192=2.74 +0.5=3.24 +0.2249=3.4649.

So sum sin δ_l ≈3.4649.

Multiply by (k/(4π)).

k=7.15 MeV.

So (7.15 MeV)/(4π) * sum ≈ (7.15 /12.566) *3.4649 → (0.57) *3.4649≈1.97.

But units? If k is in MeV, what's the conversion to fm? As before, 1 MeV^{-1} ≈0.197 fm. So 1 MeV ≈5.076 fm^{-1}.

But I'm not sure how this ties into the final result.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (k/(4π)) sum (sin(2 δ_l) )/(2l+1).

Wait, earlier I calculated the sum of [ sin(2 δ_l) / (2l+1) ] as approximately 0.6001.

So (k/(4π)) *0.6001.

k=7.15 MeV.

So (7.15/(4 *3.1416)) ) *0.6001 → (7.15/12.566) *0.6001 → 0.57 *0.6001≈0.342.

Again, units?

Well, 1 MeV^{-1} is about 0.197 fm, so 1 MeV is 1/(0.197 fm) → about 5.076 fm^{-1}.

So 0.342 MeV → 0.342 * 0.197 fm ≈ 0.0675 fm → 0.0675 fm is 6.75e-14 m. But the options are in the range of 177 fm to 87163 fm. So this approach can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is the sum of all the phase shifts multiplied by some factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (k/(2π)) times the sum of ( sin δ_l )/(2l+1) ) multiplied by something.

Wait, let's compute the sum of sin δ_l/(2l+1) for each l.

l=0: sin 90/(1) →1/1=1.

l=1: sin67 /3 →0.9205/3≈0.3068.

l=2: sin55/5 →0.8192/5≈0.1638.

l=3: sin30/7 →0.5/7≈0.0714.

l=4: sin13/9 →0.2249/9≈0.0250.

Sum:1 +0.3068=1.3068 +0.1638=1.4706 +0.0714=1.542 +0.025→1.567.

Multiply by (k/(2π)).

k=7.15 MeV.

So (7.15/(2 *3.1416)) ) *1.567 → (7.15/6.283) ≈1.138 *1.567≈1.784.

Again, units: 1 MeV is about 5.076 fm^{-1}.

So 1.784 MeV → 1.784 * 0.197 fm ≈ 0.350 fm. But this is way smaller than any of the options, which are in the hundreds or thousands of fm. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore all the phase shifts except the first one, but that doesn't make sense given the data.

Another thought: maybe the formula for the imaginary part is simply (k/(4π)) times the sum of phase shifts in radians.

Wait, sum of phase shifts in radians:

90°=π/2, 67°=1.16937 radians, 55=0.95993, 30=0.52359, 13=0.22689.

Sum: π/2 +1.16937 +0.95993 +0.52359 +0.22689.

Compute π/2≈1.5708.

Sum≈1.5708 +1.16937=2.74017 +0.95993=3.7001 +0.52359=4.2237 +0.22689≈4.4506 radians.

Multiply by (k/(4π)).

k=7.15 MeV.

(7.15/(4 *3.1416)) ) *4.4506 → (7.15/(12.566)) *4.4506 → approx (0.57) *4.4506≈2.542.

Multiply by 0.197 fm/MeV^{-1} → 2.542 *0.197 ≈ 0.500 fm. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm clearly missing something here. Perhaps I should look up the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts.

After thinking for a while, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) Σ [ (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin δ_l ]

But again, without a_l, I can't proceed. So perhaps the only way to find the solution is to look for a formula that directly relates the given phase shifts to the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin(2 δ_l) ]

But again, without a_l, can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f(0)) = Σ [ ( (4π a_l sin δ_l ) / (k (2l +1)) ) ]

But again, without a_l, this is not solvable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that a_l = (k/(2π)) ( sin δ_l ) / ( δ_l )

But even if I use that formula, which is only an approximation for small δ_l, let's try:

a_l = (k/(2π)) * ( sin δ_l ) / ( δ_l )

Then, substitute into Im(f(0)):

Im(f(0)) = sum [ (4π/(2l+1)) a_l sin δ_l ) /k ]

= sum [ (4π/(2l+1)) * (k/(2π)) ( sin δ_l )/( δ_l )) * sin δ_l ) / k ]

The k and π terms cancel:

= sum [ (4/(2l+1)) * ( sin^2 δ_l ) / (2 δ_l ) ) ]

= sum [ (2 sin^2 δ_l ) / ( (2l+1) δ_l ) ) ]

Now, compute each term for l=0 to 4:

l=0: δ0=90°=π/2 radians.

sin(π/2)=1, so sin^2=1.

δ_l=π/2.

Term = [2 * 1 ] / [1 * (π/2) ) ] = 2 / (π/2) ) = 4/π ≈1.273.

l=1: δ1=67°=1.16937 rad.

sin(67)= approx 0.9205 → sin^2=0.847.

δ_l=1.16937.

Term= [2 *0.847 ] / [3 *1.16937 ]

= (1.694) / (3.508) ≈0.4827.

l=2: δ2=55°=0.95993 rad.

sin(55)=0.8192 → sin^2≈0.671.

δ_l=0.95993.

Term= [2 *0.671 ] / [5 *0.95993 ] → (1.342)/(4.79965)≈0.2795.

l=3: δ3=30°=0.52359 rad.

sin(30)=0.5 → sin^2=0.25.

δ_l=0.52359.

Term= [2 *0.25 ] / [7 *0.52359 ] → (0.5) / (3.6651) ≈0.1364.

l=4: δ4=13°=0.22689 rad.

sin(13)=0.2249 → sin^2≈0.0506.

δ_l=0.22689.

Term= [2 *0.0506 ] / [9 *0.22689 ] → (0.1012) / (2.042) ≈0.0495.

Now, sum all terms:

l=0:1.273

l=1:0.4827 → sum=1.7557

l=2:0.2795→ sum=2.0352

l=3:0.1364 → sum=2.1716

l=4:0.0495 → sum≈2.2211.

So Im(f(0))= sum≈2.2211.

But what's the unit? Each term is dimensionless, but the sum is multiplied by something, but in the formula, we have:

Im(f(0)) = sum (2 sin^2 δ_l ) / [ (2l+1) δ_l ) ]

But wait, the units would be in (1/(2l+1)) * (sin^2 δ_l ) / δ_l → which is dimensionless, so Im(f(0)) would be dimensionless? No, that can't be right because f has units of length.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, going back, we had a_l = (k/(2π)) ( sin δ_l ) / ( δ_l )

So, a_l has units of length, correct.

Then, Im(f(0)) = sum [ (4π a_l sin δ_l )/(k (2l+1) ) ]

Substituting a_l:

= sum [ (4π (k/(2π)) ( sin δ_l )/( δ_l ) ) * sin δ_l ) / (k (2l+1) ) ]

Simplify:

k cancels: numerator has k, denominator has k.

π cancels: 4π * (1/(2π)) → 2.

So Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2 ( sin δ_l )^2 ) / ( δ_l (2l+1) ) ) ]

Which is what I computed earlier, giving the sum≈2.2211.

But Im(f(0)) should have units of length.

Wait, because f has units of length (since it's an amplitude, in natural units, f is in (energy)^{-1} which is length).

So the sum I computed is 2.2211, but what's the unit?

Wait, from the substitution, each term is ( sin^2 δ ) / ( δ * (2l+1) ), which is dimensionless, but then multiplied by (k/(2π)) → which has units of energy, and then divided by k → (energy)/(energy) → unitless. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is (k/(4π)) * sum [ ( (4π/(Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scattering of electrons. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, and the electrons are at 50 MeV. Also, I should ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so I guess that means up to l=4?

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a series expansion involving the phase shifts. The formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}), or something like that. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the imaginary part might come from a specific term.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude for each partial wave is (2l+1)/(2ik) * sin(2δ_l) sin(lθ). But wait, no, maybe that's not right. Or perhaps the total amplitude is the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l (something). Hmm.

Wait, the general expression I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) ] ... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part comes from the interference terms, but in this case, perhaps the question is simpler.

Wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, wait, when θ=0°, that's along the incident beam. So θ=0°, so sin(lθ) becomes sin(0) for any l except maybe l=0? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by the sum of terms involving sinδ_l multiplied by some factors.

Wait, another thought: The total scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all partial waves, each contributing something like (2l+1)/(k) * e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l (something with cosθ?), but maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the optical theorem. The optical theorem says that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is related to the total cross-section. The formula is Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total, where k is the wave number.

But wait, the question isn't giving any cross-sections, so maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude.

The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ)

Where P_l is the Legendre polynomial of order l. So for each l, the term contributes to f(θ). But I'm interested in the imaginary part of f(0).

Wait, when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So at θ=0, the expression simplifies.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * 1.

Now, expanding e^{2iδ_l} -1: e^{iφ} -1 = e^{iφ/2} (e^{iφ/2} - e^{-iφ/2}) ) = 2i e^{iφ/2} sin(φ/2).

Wait, let me compute e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{i 2δ_l} -1.

Which can be written as [cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l)] -1 = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l).

So the real part is cos(2δ_l) -1, and the imaginary part is sin(2δ_l).

But I'm interested in the imaginary part of f(0). So let's calculate Im[f(0)].

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So f(0) has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part would be (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but let me write this more carefully.

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) ( cos(2δ_l) -1 + i sin(2δ_l) ) ]

Breaking this into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1) 

Imaginary part: (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) 

Wait, but 1/(2ik) is ( -i )/(2k ), since 1/i = -i. So,

Imaginary part of f(0) is [ ( -i )/( 2k ) ) ] * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, but the imaginary part is the coefficient of i in f(0). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here. Let me think.

Wait, f(0) is a complex quantity. Let's write f(0) = A + i B, where A is real and B is the imaginary part.

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is f(0) (since θ=0 is along the beam). So Im[f(0)] is B.

Wait, but in the expression above, the imaginary part is [ (1/(2ik)) * sum( (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) ].

Hmm. Let me compute that.

First, (1/(2ik)) is (1/(2i k)).

So,

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i.

So,

Im[f(0)] = [ (-i)/(2k) ] * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

But wait, when you multiply by (-i), it's the same as taking the imaginary part. Hmm, maybe not, perhaps I should just compute the expression.

Wait, but the problem is to find the imaginary part, so let me compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l). So for each l, compute that, sum them all, multiply by (-i)/(2k), and take the imaginary part.

Wait, but the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i in f(0), so perhaps the expression is:

Im[f(0)] = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (-1)/(2k) )

Because the i is multiplied by that sum and then divided by 2k. So,

Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (-1) / (2k) )

Wait, but let's think about units. The given options are in fm, which is 1e-15 meters. The energy is 50 MeV, so I need to compute k, the wave number.

The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ . But wait, the mass m of the electron is 9.109e-31 kg. The energy E is 50 MeV. Let me compute E in Joules.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-13 J.

So,

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ

Where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J )

Let me compute that:

2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

Multiply by E: 1.8218e-30 * 8.01e-13 = 1.459e-42.

Take sqrt: sqrt(1.459e-42) ≈ 3.822e-21 m.

So,

k = 3.822e-21 m / 1.0545718e-34 m²·kg/s = (3.822e-21)/(1.0545718e-34) ≈ 3.623e13 m⁻¹.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 3.822e-21 divided by 1.05457e-34 is approximately 3.623e13 m⁻¹, yes.

So, k ≈ 3.623e13 m⁻¹.

Now, let's compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

Each δ is given as:

l=0: δ₀=90°
l=1: δ₁=67°
l=2: δ₂=55°
l=3: δ₃=30°
l=4: δ₄=13°

So, for each l, compute (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l).

Let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0 + 1)* sin(2*90°) = 1 * sin(180°) = 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°) → 134 degrees is in the second quadrant. Wait, sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193.

So 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: 5 * sin(110°) → 110 degrees, sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397.

5 * 0.9397 ≈ 4.6985.

l=3: 7 * sin(60°) → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

7 * 0.8660 ≈ 6.062.

l=4: 9 * sin(26°) → sin(26)≈0.4384.

So, 9 * 0.4384 ≈ 3.9456.

Now sum all these terms:

0 (l=0) + 2.1579 (l=1) +4.6985 (l=2) +6.062 (l=3) +3.9456 (l=4) = let's add step by step.

2.1579 +4.6985 = 6.8564

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184

12.9184 +3.9456 =16.864.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

Now, the imaginary part Im[f(0)] is (sum) * (-1)/(2k) 

Wait, but what about the units? Let me think.

The expression is Im[f(0)] = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (-1)/(2k )

But wait, what's the sign here? Wait, the formula after substitution was:

Im[f(0)] = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (-1)/(2k )

Wait, let me check the earlier steps. From earlier, I think that the expression was:

Im[f(0)] = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (-1) / (2k )

Wait, but I also need to think about the definition of the scattering amplitude. The formula I used for f(θ) might have a (1/(2ik)) factor, which introduces the i. So when taking the imaginary part, perhaps the sign is positive. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I thought:

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), so if I have a term that's (something) * -i/(2k), then the imaginary part is (something) * 1/(2k), because the i is multiplied by that.

Wait, no. Let's take an example. Let me represent a complex number as A + i B. The imaginary part is B.

In this case, (1/(2ik)) is (-i)/(2k), so when I multiply by the sum,

each term is [sum ... ] * (-i)/(2k) = (-i) (sum ... )/(2k)

So, the entire expression is a purely imaginary number. So, the imaginary part is [sum ... ]/(2k), but with a negative sign.

Wait, no: because (-i) * X is a purely imaginary number. If X is real, then (-i X) has an imaginary part of -X.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of a complex number. Suppose I have a term like (i * a), where a is a real number. Then, the imaginary part is a. Similarly, (-i * a) has an imaginary part of -a.

Wait, for example, if I have a complex number like 0 + i*(3), then the imaginary part is 3. If the complex number is 0 + i*(-3), the imaginary part is -3.

In our case, Im[f(0)] is the coefficient of the i term. So, considering f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum(...), which is (sum ... ) * (1/(2ik)).

Which is (sum ... ) * ( -i )/(2k )

So, f(0) is (sum ... ) * (-i)/(2k )

Which can be written as 0 + i [ (- sum ... )/(2k) ]

Thus, the imaginary part of f(0) is [ (- sum ... )/(2k) ]

Wait, but let's calculate the sum again.

The sum is 16.864 as calculated earlier. So,

Im(f(0)) = (-16.864) / (2 * 3.623e13 )

But wait, let's compute the denominator: 2 * 3.623e13 = 7.246e13.

So,

Im(f(0)) = (-16.864) / 7.246e13 ≈ -2.327e-13.

Wait, but the options are all positive and in the order of 1e2 fm, which is 1e-13 meters. Hmm. Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, so 1e-13 meters is 100 fm.

Wait, but my calculation here gives me a magnitude of about 2.327e-13 m, which is 232.7 fm. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's go back. Did I get the formula correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) * (1/k) ?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for f(θ). Let me try to find the correct expression for the scattering amplitude.

After checking, I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) ( sin δ_l )^2 * ( e^{i l θ} - e^{-i l θ} ) / (1 - e^{2i δ_l} ) ]

Wait, that might not be the correct form. Alternatively, another approach is that the partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ )

So, when θ=0, P_l(cosθ)=1. So f(0) becomes (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1 )

Which can be written as:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1 ]

Breaking into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 )

Imaginary part: (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), so the imaginary part becomes:

Im(f(0)) = [ Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) ] * (-i)/(2k) ) 

But since we're taking the imaginary part, which is the coefficient of i, so:

Im(f(0)) = [ Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (-1) / (2k )

Wait, but earlier I thought this was the case. So, let's proceed.

Sum is 16.864.

So:

Im(f(0)) = (-16.864) / (2 * 3.623e13 )

Compute denominator: 2 * 3.623e13 = 7.246e13.

So,

Im(f(0)) = (-16.864) / 7.246e13 ≈ -2.327e-13 m.

But the options are positive. So perhaps I missed a negative sign in the formula. Maybe the correct expression is Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]/(2k) )

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct expression is Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]/(2k) * (1/(2i)) ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the units again.

The options are in femtometers (fm), which is 1e-15 m.

Wait, 1e-13 m is 100 fm.

In my calculation, Im(f(0)) is approximately -2.327e-13 m, which is -232.7 fm.

But the options don't have that. The options are A)87163.4, B)355.35, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Wait, option D is 251.271 fm, which is about 2.5e-13 m. Wait, but my calculation is about 2.3e-13, which is not matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the sum. Let me recompute the individual terms more accurately.

Let me compute each term again, perhaps in radians, since the sine function in the formula expects radians.

Wait, wait, no. The formula uses degrees because the phase shifts are given in degrees. So, I should convert each δ_l to radians before calculating sin(2δ_l).

Ah! Wait, yes. I think I forgot to convert degrees to radians. That's a big mistake. Let me correct that.

So each δ_l is given in degrees, so to compute sin(2δ_l), I have to convert each to radians.

So, let's recompute each term with δ in radians.

Compute for each l:

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180° → sin(180°) = 0. So term is 1 * 0 = 0.

l=1: δ=67° → 2δ=134° → 134 * π/180 ≈ 2.340 radians.

sin(134°) = sin(2.340) = sin(π - 0.801) = sin(0.801) ≈ 0.7193.

So term: 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: δ=55° → 2δ=110° → 110 * π/180 ≈ 1.91986 radians.

sin(110°)=sin(1.91986)= approx 0.9397.

Term: 5 * 0.9397 ≈ 4.6985.

l=3: δ=30° → 2δ=60° → 60 * π/180=1.0472 radians.

sin(60°)=√3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Term:7 * 0.8660 ≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13° → 2δ=26° → 26 * π/180≈0.4538 radians.

sin(26°)=0.4384.

Term:9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

So the sum is same as before: 0 + 2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = 16.863 approximately.

So that part is correct. Then, the error must be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

Wait, 2mE: E is 50 MeV. Wait, but when using E in Joules, I need to make sure the units are correct.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 =8.01e-13 J.

m is the electron mass: 9.109e-31 kg.

So,

sqrt(2 * m * E ) = sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J )

Compute the product inside the square root:

2 *9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30.

Multiply by E (8.01e-13 J ): 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 =1.459e-42 kg·J.

But J is kg·m²/s², so kg·J = kg²·m²/s².

So sqrt(1.459e-42 kg²·m²/s² ) = sqrt(1.459e-42) kg·m/s.

sqrt(1.459e-42) = approx 3.822e-21 m/s.

Then, divide by ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s =1.0545718e-34 m²·kg/s.

So,

k = (3.822e-21 m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 m²·kg/s )

Wait, wait, units:

kg·m/s divided by (m²·kg/s) ) → (kg·m/s) * (s)/(m²·kg) ) → (s * kg * m )/( m² kg s ) → 1/m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numbers accurately.

3.822e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 = (3.822 / 1.0545718) * 1e13 ≈ 3.623 *1e13 → 3.623e13 m⁻¹.

So that part is correct.

So Im(f(0))= (-16.864)/(2 * 3.623e13 ) = (-16.864)/(7.246e13) ≈ -2.327e-13 m → -232.7 fm.

But none of the options match. The closest is option D: 251.271 fm. Hmm, but I'm getting 232.7 fm. That's a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that I should take the magnitude, so 232.7 fm. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to multiply by a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k) )

Wait, if I drop the negative sign, then it's 16.864/(2k) → 16.864/(7.246e13) ≈ 2.327e-13 m → 232.7 fm. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

In that case, the value would be 16.864/(2 *3.623e13 ) = 16.864/(7.246e13) ≈ 2.327e-13 m → 232.7 fm.

But the options don't have that. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A)87163.4 fm → 8.7e4 fm, which is 8.7e-13 m.

B)355.351 fm → ~3.55e-13 m.

C)177.675 fm → ~1.77e-13 m.

D)251.271 fm → ~2.51e-13 m.

Wait, 2.327e-13 m is about 232.7 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/k) )

Wait, then that would be 16.864 / (3.623e13) → ~4.65e-13 m → 465 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2. Let me see.

Wait, the formula I used for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ )

So when θ=0, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

Breaking into real and imaginary parts, the imaginary part is:

Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)) * (-1)

Wait, perhaps I should take the magnitude, so it's [ sum ... ]/(2k) )

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have a positive sign. Maybe I have the sign wrong, but the magnitude is important. So if I have 16.864/(2k) → 2.327e-13 m → 232.7 fm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts given are in degrees, but when calculating sin(2δ), I should have converted each δ to radians. Let me check that.

Wait, no, because sin in the formula is in radians, so I must convert degrees to radians. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute each term with more precise numbers.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(180°) = 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°) = 3 * sin(134 degrees).

Let me compute sin(134°) accurately.

134 degrees is 180-46, so sin(134)=sin(46).

sin(46) ≈ 0.719339800338.

So term is 3 * 0.7193398 = 2.1580194.

l=2: 5 * sin(110°) =5 * sin(110 degrees).

sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9396926208.

5 * 0.9396926208 ≈4.698463.

l=3:7 * sin(60°) =7 * (√3/2) ≈7 *0.8660254038 ≈6.0621778.

l=4:9 * sin(26°) =9 * 0.4383711468 ≈3.9453403.

Now, sum all terms:

0 + 2.1580194 +4.698463 +6.0621778 +3.9453403 = let's add step by step.

2.1580194 +4.698463 =6.8564824

6.8564824 +6.0621778=12.9186602

12.9186602 +3.9453403=16.864.

So sum is 16.864. Correct.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't present in the options, but I might have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) )

Because in some references, the imaginary part is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), but maybe I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is related to the T-matrix, and the imaginary part of f(0) is (k/(4π)) * sigma_total.

But without knowing sigma_total, perhaps that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

After a quick search in notes, I find that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total.

But without sigma_total, I don't think that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another formula involving phase shifts.

Wait, another thought: The total cross-section is given by σ_total = 4π/k² sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

So, if I can compute σ_total, then Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total = (k/(4π)) * 4π/k² sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l → Im f(0)= (sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l )/(k )

But wait, that's the real part, I think. Hmm.

Wait, the real part of f(0) is related to the total cross-section. The imaginary part is given by the formula I earlier used.

I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should accept that my calculation leads to approximately 232 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me consider that perhaps the correct formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

If that's the case, then let's compute the sum with sin δ_l.

So,

sum = Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Let's compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(90°) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°) ≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55) ≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum is 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

So sum is 13.38205.

Then, Im(f(0))= (13.38205) / (2k) → 13.38205/(2*3.623e13) → 13.38205/(7.246e13) ≈1.849e-13 m →184.9 fm.

Still not matching the options. But option C is 177.675 fm, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Wait, let me recompute with exact terms:

Compute (2l+1)* sin(δ_l) for each l:

l=0: 1 * sin(90 degrees) =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) → 67 degrees is 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

sin(67°)≈0.9205048534.

So 3 * 0.9205048534 =2.76151456.

l=2:5 * sin(55) →55 degrees is 55 * π/180≈0.95993 radians.

sin(55)≈0.8191520443.

5 *0.8191520443=4.09576022.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13) →13 degrees is 13 * π/180≈0.22689 radians.

sin(13)≈0.2249510543.

9 *0.2249510543≈2.024559489.

Sum: 1 +2.76151456=3.76151456; +4.09576022=7.85727478; +3.5=11.35727478; +2.024559489=13.38183427.

So sum=13.38183427.

Then,

Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) → 13.38183427/(2*3.623e13) =13.38183427/(7.246e13) ≈1.849e-13 m →184.9 fm.

Again, this is still not an option. The closest option is C)177.675 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula. Maybe the formula I should use is Im(f(0)) = sum( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k )

Which would be 13.38183427 / (3.623e13) → ~3.693e-13 m →369.3 fm, which again isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the sum of sin(δ_l), not (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

But that would give an even smaller sum, leading to a smaller Im(f(0)).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )

So, that would be 13.38183427/(2k) → same as before, 184.9 fm.

Hmm, given that none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Let me recalculate k more accurately.

Given E=50 MeV.

E=50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV =8.01e-13 J.

m=9.1093837015e-31 kg.

ħ=1.054571817e-34 J·s.

k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Compute 2mE: 2 *9.1093837015e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J = 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 → let me compute exactly:

9.1093837015e-31 *8.01e-13 = (9.1093837015 *8.01) e-44 → approx 72.95e-44 → 7.295e-43.

Multiply by 2: 14.59e-43 →1.459e-42 kg·J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so kg·J is kg²·m²/s².

So sqrt(1.459e-42 kg² m²/s² )= sqrt(1.459e-42) kg m/s.

sqrt(1.459e-42) = approx 3.822e-21 m/s.

Then, k=3.822e-21 / 1.054571817e-34 → 3.822e-21 /1.054571817e-34 = (3.822/1.054571817) * 1e13 → approx 3.623e13 m⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

3.822e-21 /1.054571817e-34 = ?

3.822 /1.054571817 ≈3.623.

Yes, so k≈3.623e13 m⁻¹.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the formula uses sin(2δ_l) or sin(δ_l). Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, leading to sum=13.3818, and Im(f(0))=13.3818/(2k)=13.3818/(7.246e13)=1.849e-13 m=184.9 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the sum is slightly different.

Wait, let me compute each term with more precise sine values:

Compute each term for (2l+1)* sin δ_l.

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 →1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°)=3 * 0.9205048534 ≈2.76151456.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.81915204428 →4.0957602214.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249510543 →2.024559489.

Sum:1 +2.76151456=3.76151456; +4.0957602214=7.8572747814; +3.5=11.3572747814; +2.024559489=13.3818342704.

So sum=13.3818342704.

Im(f(0))=13.3818342704/(2 *3.623e13 )=13.3818342704/(7.246e13 )=1.849e-13 m →184.9 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Then sum= Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * (sin90)^2=1*1=1.

l=1:3*(sin67)^2=3*(0.9205)^2≈3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5*(sin55)^2=5*(0.81915)^2≈5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7*(sin30)^2=7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9*(sin13)^2≈9*(0.22495)^2≈9*(0.0506)=4.554.

Sum=1 + 2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +4.554=13.2009.

So sum≈13.2009.

Then, Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) →13.2009/(7.246e13 ) ≈1.820e-13 m →182 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) / (2k) )

Which would be 13.381834/(2*3.623e13) =13.381834/(7.246e13)=1.849e-13 m →184.9 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are for higher l values beyond 4, but the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4. So no, that's not the issue.

Another thought: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part uses (2l+1) sin(δ_l) and multiplies by 1/(k) instead of 1/(2k).

Wait, let's try that.

Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) /k →13.381834/(3.623e13 )=3.693e-13 m →369.3 fm.

This is 369.3 fm, which is close to option A) 87163.4 fm which is way larger, B)355.35 fm, which is close. Hmm, 369.3 is close to option B's 355.35, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are all in degrees, but when converted to radians, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the sum using the exact values of δ_l in radians.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula from scattering theory.

Wait, I found a reference that says the scattering amplitude f(theta) is given by:

f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^infinity (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cos(theta)).

Therefore, at theta=0, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Because when you expand e^{2iδ_l} -1 = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1.

So the imaginary part comes from the sin(2δ_l) term.

Thus, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So, sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) is 16.864.

So Im(f(0))=16.864/(2*3.623e13 )=16.864/(7.246e13 )=2.327e-13 m →232.7 fm.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Let me recompute k accurately.

Compute k:

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

m =9.1093837e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV=50e6 eV *1.602176634e-19 J/eV =50e6 *1.602176634e-19 =8.01088317e-13 J.

Compute 2mE: 2 *9.1093837e-31 *8.01088317e-13.

= 2 *9.1093837e-31 *8.01088317e-13.

= (2 *9.1093837 *8.01088317 )e-44.

Compute 2 *9.1093837=18.2187674.

18.2187674 *8.01088317= let's compute:

18 *8=144.

18*0.01088317≈0.1959.

0.2187674 *8=1.7501392.

0.2187674 *0.01088317≈0.002384.

Adding all together: 144 +0.1959=144.1959 +1.7501392=145.9460 +0.002384≈145.9484.

So 2mE=145.9484e-44 →1.459484e-42.

Now, sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(1.459484e-42 )= approx 3.822e-21 m/s.

Divide by ħ=1.054571817e-34 J·s.

So,

k=3.822e-21 /1.054571817e-34 = (3.822 /1.054571817) *1e13.

3.822 / 1.054571817 ≈3.623.

So, k≈3.623e13 m⁻¹.

Thus, Im(f(0))=16.864/(2*3.623e13 )=16.864/(7.246e13 )=2.327e-13 m →232.7 fm.

But no option matches this. The closest option is D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but that's impossible because the given degrees are in the question. So, perhaps I should conclude that the closest option is D)251.271 fm, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l).

Wait, let me recompute each term with more precise sine values.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(180°) =0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°).

134 degrees: 180-46=134.

sin(134)=sin(46)≈0.7193398003.

3 *0.7193398003=2.158019401.

l=2:5 * sin(110).

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9396926208.

5 *0.9396926208=4.698463104.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660254038=6.062177827.

l=4:9 * sin(26).

sin(26)=0.4383711468.

9 *0.4383711468=3.945340321.

Sum: 0 +2.158019401=2.158019401 +4.698463104=6.856482505 +6.062177827=12.91866033 +3.945340321=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must choose from the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using (2l+1) sin(δ_l) and get 13.38183427, leading to Im(f(0))=13.38183/(2*3.623e13)=1.849e-13 m →184.9 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are provided in a different way. Let me think: perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ) * (1 + cos(θ) ), but for θ=0, that would be (1 +1)=2, but that doesn't align with earlier formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ) * (something else). I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should pick the closest option based on my initial calculation. But none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

Which gives 16.864/(2 *3.623e13)=2.327e-13 m →232.7 fm.

Looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) times sin(δ_l) and then multiplies by (1/k), not (1/(2k)).

In that case, Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ) /k →13.38183427/(3.623e13 )=3.693e-13 m →369.3 fm.

Which is close to option B)355.351 fm.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is about half of 369.3 fm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 in the formula, leading to 369.3 /2=184.65 fm, which is again not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the calculations, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake, and the intended formula uses (2l+1) sin(δ_l), leading to 13.38183427/(2k)=184.9 fm. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)177.675 fm, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude \( f(\theta) \) is given by:

\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \left[ e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right] P_l(\cos\theta),
\]

where \( P_l \) is the Legendre polynomial of order \( l \), \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts, and \( k \) is the wave number. At \( \theta = 0 \) (along the incident beam direction), \( P_l(\cos\theta) = 1 \), simplifying the expression for \( f(0) \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \left[ e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right].
\]

Breaking this into real and imaginary parts, the imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Step 1: Compute the wave number \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is given by:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar},
\]

where \( m \) is the electron mass (\( 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)), \( E \) is the energy of the electrons (\( 50 \, \text{MeV} = 8.01 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \)), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( 1.054571817 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-13}}}{1.054571817 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 3.623 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1}.

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \)
The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). For \( l > 4 \), the phase shifts are ignored. The sine function must be evaluated in radians.

For each \( l \), compute \( (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \):

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2 \cdot 0 + 1) \sin(2 \cdot 90^\circ) = 1 \cdot \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \).
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2 \cdot 1 + 1) \sin(2 \cdot 67^\circ) = 3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.7193 = 2.1579 \).
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2 \cdot 2 + 1) \sin(2 \cdot 55^\circ) = 5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985 \).
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2 \cdot 3 + 1) \sin(2 \cdot 30^\circ) = 7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062 \).
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2 \cdot 4 + 1) \sin(2 \cdot 13^\circ) = 9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456 \).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) = 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \)
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)}{2k},
\]

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 3.623 \times 10^{13}} = \frac{16.864}{7.246 \times 10^{13}} \approx 2.327 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m}.
\]

Convert to femtometers (\( 1 \, \text{fm} = 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 232.7 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( 232.7 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the given options exactly. However, the closest option is **D) 251.271 fm**. Given the possible approximations and rounding in the problem, this is likely the intended answer.
