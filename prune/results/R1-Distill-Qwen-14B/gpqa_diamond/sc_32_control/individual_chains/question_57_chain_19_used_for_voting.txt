Okay, let me try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic electron scattering. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude often has a connection to the phase shifts. 

Wait, the formula I think involves the sum of the phase shifts. Oh right, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by something like (1/(2ik)) times the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors... I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Oh, right! For the scattering amplitude f, the imaginary part along the forward direction (which is when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees) is given by (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of all the phase shifts δ_l multiplied by (2l + 1), perhaps? Or wait, maybe the sum is of (2l + 1) times δ_l. Because each partial wave contributes based on its angular momentum l.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The general expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^{L} [ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. Oh right, but when θ is 0 degrees, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l, since P_0=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. So in the forward direction, the sum simplifies.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part. So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would then be (1/(2ik)) times the sum over l of (2l +1) times the imaginary part of e^{i2δ_l}.

Wait, e^{i2δ_l} can be written as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So the imaginary part of e^{i2δ_l} is sin(2δ_l). So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for each l.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the exact factors. Let me make sure. The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ). So when θ=0, each P_l(1)=1, so f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1).

The imaginary part of f is then (1/(2ik)) times the imaginary part of the sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1).

Wait, but e^{iθ} -1 is (cosθ +i sinθ) -1 = (cosθ -1) + i sinθ. So the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) is sin(2δ_l). So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So the formula I need is: Im f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)

Wait, but what about the value of k? Oh right, k is the wave number. The electrons have energy E=50 MeV. Electrons are relativistic, so their mass is about 0.511 MeV/c², so 50 MeV is much larger than their rest mass. So non-relativistic formulas might not apply, but wait, how to find k?

The relativistic expression for the momentum p is sqrt(2mE), but wait, wait. Let me think. The relation between energy, momentum, and mass for an electron is E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c. Hmm, but the units are a bit messy. Let me proceed carefully.

E is given as 50 MeV. m c² is 0.511 MeV. So E >> m c², so we can approximate p c ≈ E. So p ≈ E/(c). Then, the wave number k is p/ħ. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. Wait, because ħc is about 197.33 MeV fm. So k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / ħ. Wait, but E is in MeV, ħc is in MeV fm. Let me compute k.

Alternatively, k can be found as k = (E) / (ħc), because p = E/c (approximation for high E). So k = E/(ħc). Let me compute that.

Given E =50 MeV, ħc is about 197.33 MeV fm. So k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but wait, no. Because k has units of inverse length. So when E is in units of MeV, and ħc is MeV fm, then E/(ħc) would have units 1/(fm), which is correct for k. So yes, k ≈ 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

But wait, another approach: For electrons, the de Broglie wavelength λ is given by λ = h/(p c) * c. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of relativistic energy. The wave number k is sqrt(2 m E) / ħ, but wait, that's when E is the kinetic energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the relation E = ħ² k² / (2m) in non-relativistic limit, but since E is 50 MeV which is way higher than m c² (0.511 MeV), non-relativistic isn't valid. So the relativistic formula is better.

So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ≈ E (since E >> m c^2). So p ≈ E/(c). Then k = p / ħ = (E/(c)) / ħ.

But ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm. So E/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Now, the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is Im f = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Wait, but wait, in the options, the answers are in fm. But the imaginary part of f has units of fm, because f has units of fm (since it's a scattering amplitude, and cross-section is f² * 4π, so f in fm gives cross-section in barns).

Wait, but let's compute step by step. Let me write down the formula:

Im f(0) = [ 1/(2i k) ] * sum_{l} (2l +1) sin(2 δ_l )

Wait, but the sum is over all the phase shifts given. Let me look at the problem: it gives δ_0 =90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. The rest are ignored.

So the sum is from l=0 to l=4. For each l, (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Wait, but wait. Are these δ_l the phase shifts for each l? The question says "ignore the rest of the phase shifts", so only l=0 to l=4 are considered.

So let's compute each term:

- l=0: (2*0 +1) sin(2 * 90°) → 1 * sin(180°) → sin(180)=0 → term is 0.
- l=1: (2*1 +1)=3 → 3 * sin(2*67) → 3 * sin(134°)
- l=2: (5) * sin(110°)
- l=3: (7) * sin(60°)
- l=4: (9) * sin(26°)

Compute each sin:

l=1: 134 degrees → sin(134)= sin(180-46)= sin(46)≈ 0.7193 → 3 * 0.7193 = 2.1579
l=2:110 → sin(110)= sin(70)=approx 0.9397 →5 *0.9397≈4.6985
l=3:60 → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660 →7 *0.866≈6.062
l=4:26 → sin(26)≈0.4384 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456

Now sum all these:

2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is approximately 16.864.

Now compute (1/(2 i k)) * (sum) → [1/(2i k)] * 16.864.

But wait, we're only interested in the imaginary part of f. Hmm, let me think. Because the formula is [1/(2i k)] multiplied by a real number (since the sum is real). Let's compute this.

Wait, 1/(2i k) is 1/(2i * 0.253 fm^{-1}) ) → 1/( (2 * 0.253) i / fm ) ) → 1/(0.506 i / fm ) → (1 / 0.506) * (1/i) fm.

Since 1/i = -i, so (1/0.506) * (-i) fm → approximately (-i) * 1.976 fm.

Wait, but let me compute the numerical value.

1/(2ik) = 1/(2i * 0.253) → 1/(0.506 i) → multiply numerator and denominator by -i: ( -i ) / (0.506 * (i * -i) ) → (-i)/(0.506 * 1) → (-i)/0.506 → approximately (-i) * 1.976.

So 1/(2ik) ≈ -i * 1.976 fm^{-1}.

Now multiply this by the sum, which is 16.864:

Im f = (1/(2ik)) * sum → (-i *1.976 fm^{-1}) * 16.864 → -i * (1.976 *16.864) fm^{-1}.

Wait, but wait, the sum is a real number, so when you multiply it by 1/(2ik), which has an i in the denominator, you get a term with i in the numerator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back.

Wait, f(theta) is a complex quantity, and the formula is f= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ} - 1) P_l(1).

So the imaginary part of f is Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ} -1) ].

Wait, since 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i.

So Im [ (-i/(2k)) * sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ} -1) ].

But e^{2iδ} -1 is a complex number, so let me write it as C_l = (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1).

Which can be written as (2l+1)[ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sin(2δ_l) ].

So the sum is a sum of complex numbers. So when you multiply by (-i/(2k)), which is a real factor times i, and then take the imaginary part, perhaps?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the imaginary part of f is (1/(2ik)) times the imaginary part of the sum.

Wait, no, actually, because Im[f] = Im [ (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ].

Let me denote S = sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1). So f = (1/(2ik)) S.

Then, Im(f) = Im( (1/(2ik)) S ).

But S is a complex number. Let me write S = S_real + i S_imag.

So (1/(2ik)) S = (1/(2ik)) (S_real + i S_imag) ) = (S_real)/(2ik) + (i S_imag)/(2ik)).

Simplify each term:

First term: S_real/(2ik) = S_real/(2ik) → multiply numerator and denominator by -i: ( -i S_real )/(2k) → ( -i S_real )/(2k). The imaginary part of this term is zero, because it's purely imaginary.

Second term: (i S_imag)/(2ik) ) → (i/(2ik)) S_imag → (1/(2k)) S_imag. The imaginary part of this term is zero because it's real.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I should compute Im[f] correctly.

Wait, no, wait. The expression is Im [ (1/(2ik)) (S_real + i S_imag) ) ].

Let me compute:

(1/(2ik)) (S_real + i S_imag) = (S_real)/(2ik) + (i S_imag)/(2ik)
= (S_real)/(2ik) ) + (S_imag)/(2k) (since i/(i k) = 1/k )

So, this is a complex number. The imaginary part is the coefficient of i in this expression.

Looking at the first term: (S_real)/(2ik) = ( S_real )/(2ik ) = ( S_real ) * (1/(2ik)).

Let me write 1/(2ik) as (1/(2i k)) = ( -i )/(2k ), because 1/i is -i.

So (S_real) * ( -i )/(2k ) → ( -i S_real )/(2k ). So the imaginary part of this term is ( - S_real )/(2k ), because it's multiplied by i.

The second term is (S_imag)/(2k ), which has no imaginary component; it's real.

So the total imaginary part is [ (- S_real )/(2k ) ].

Wait, so Im(f) = [ (- S_real )/(2k ) ].

Because the first term's imaginary part is (- S_real )/(2k ), and the second term doesn't contribute to the imaginary part.

But S_real is the real part of the sum S. So S_real = sum (2l+1) (cos(2 δ_l) - 1 ), since e^{2iδ_l} -1 = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2 δ_l).

So, let's compute S_real:

For each l:

l=0: (2l+1) =1 → cos(180) -1 = (-1) -1 = -2 → term is 1*(-2) = -2.
l=1: 3 → cos(134°) ≈ -0.6947 → cos(134) -1 ≈ -1.6947 → 3*(-1.6947) ≈ -5.0841
l=2:5 → cos(110°)=cos(180-70)=-cos(70)≈-0.3420 → cos(110)-1 ≈ -1.3420 →5*(-1.3420)= -6.71
l=3:7 → cos(60)=0.5 → 0.5 -1= -0.5 →7*(-0.5)= -3.5
l=4:9 →cos(26)≈0.8988 →0.8988 -1= -0.1012 →9*(-0.1012)≈-0.9108

Now sum all S_real terms:

-2 (l=0) 
-5.0841 (l=1) → total so far -7.0841
-6.71 (l=2) → total -13.7941
-3.5 (l=3) → total -17.2941
-0.9108 (l=4) → total S_real ≈-18.2049.

So S_real ≈ -18.2049.

Then, Im(f) = (- S_real )/(2k ) → (18.2049)/(2 *k )

k is 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 2*k ≈ 0.506 fm^{-1}.

So numerator is 18.2049, denominator 0.506.

18.2049 /0.506 ≈ approximately 35.9 fm.

Wait, because 0.506 *35 ≈ 17.71, 0.506 *36=18.216. So 18.2049/0.506 is approximately 35.9.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 18.2049 /0.506.

Compute 0.506 *35 = 17.71 → 18.2049-17.71=0.4949.

0.506 *0.977 ≈ 0.4949 (since 0.506 *0.977≈0.506*(1-0.023)=0.506 -0.0116=0.4944).

So approximately 35.977 → about 36.

Wait, so Im(f) ≈36 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option B: 355.351 fm, option C:177.675, D:251.271.

Hmm, my calculation gives around 36 fm, but none of the options are close to this. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Because the problem says that the phase shifts are given, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign or another factor.

Wait, let me double-check the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Another approach: The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The formula is σ_total = 4π |f|^2, but wait, more precisely, the total cross-section is (4π/ k²) Im f(0), but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is (4π/k) Im f(0). Hmm, but I'm not certain about the exact expression.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the formula for the scattering amplitude.

The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l=1, so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1 )

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ]

Which can be written as [1/(2ik)] * Im [ sum (2l+1) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ]

Wait, but the sum inside is sum (2l+1) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) → which is sum (2l+1) ( cos(2δ_l) -1 + i sin(2δ_l) )

So the sum is a complex number: sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1) ) + i sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

So when you multiply by 1/(2ik), you get [1/(2ik)] * [ S_real + i S_imag ]

Which becomes [ S_real + i S_imag ]/(2ik )

= S_real/(2ik) + i S_imag/(2ik )

= (S_real)/(2ik) + S_imag/(2k )

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary part of this expression. So:

Im(f(0)) = Im [ (S_real)/(2ik) + S_imag/(2k) ) ]

The second term is real, so its imaginary part is zero. The first term:

(S_real)/(2ik ) → write 1/(ik) = -i/(k )

So (S_real)*(-i)/(2k ) → the imaginary part is (S_real) * (-1 )/(2k )

So Im(f(0)) = [ (- S_real ) ]/(2k ) 

Wait, that's the same result as before. So with S_real ≈ -18.2049, Im(f)= (18.2049)/(2k )

k is about 0.253 fm^{-1}, so 2k=0.506.

18.2049/0.506 ≈35.94 fm.

Hmm, so Im f(0) is approximately 35.94 fm.

Looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times higher. Option C is 177.675, which is about half of 355.351. Wait, where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I should have converted them to radians when calculating sine terms. Oh! That could be a mistake. Because in calculations, trigonometric functions in code expect radians, but when I did the calculation manually, I used degrees. Wait, wait, no, in my manual calculations, I used degrees correctly, but perhaps I should have converted the angles to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, but in my calculation, I used sin(134 degrees) as approximately 0.7193. Let me check what sin(134 degrees) actually is. Wait, 134 degrees is in the second quadrant. So sin(134) = sin(180-46)= sin(46)≈0.7193. That's correct. So I didn't make a mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of k is incorrect.

Wait, let's recompute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

So E² = (50)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2.

(m c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So p c = sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈sqrt(2499.739)≈49.9974 MeV.

So p c ≈49.9974 MeV → p ≈ (49.9974 MeV)/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) → ħ in MeV s/(fm) ?

Wait, ħc is 197.33 MeV fm. So 1 fm = (ħ c) / (197.33 MeV) → but I'm getting confused with units.

Wait, let's express k in terms of units.

k (in fm^{-1}) = p/(ħ) 

But p is in MeV/c. 

Wait, ħ has units of MeV s. So, to compute k in fm^{-1}, we can use:

k = (p c) / ( ħ c )

Wait, because p = (p c)/(c). So,

k = p/(ħ) = (p c)/( ħ c )

So, since p c is about 49.9974 MeV, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, then:

k = (49.9974 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 49.9974 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that part is correct. So k is indeed approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct, but the answer I'm getting (about 36 fm) isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ?

Wait, that would change the calculation. Because earlier, I thought that Im(f) = ( - S_real )/(2k ), where S_real is sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 )

But perhaps I should have directly taken the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), multiplied by 1/(2k).

Wait, let me re-examine the formula.

The formula for Im(f) is:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, perhaps I was wrong before. Because when I thought about it, the imaginary part of the sum (2l+1)(e^{i2δ_l} -1) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), because e^{i2δ} -1 = (cos(2δ) -1) + i sin(2δ). So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Then, Im(f) = [1/(2ik)] * Im(sum ... )

But wait, since sum is a complex number, sum = real part + i sum (2l+1) sin(2delta)

So, Im(f) = [1/(2ik)] * [ sum (2l+1) sin(2delta) ]

So, the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2delta) ] / (2ik )

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) → So:

Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2delta) ] * (-i) / (2k )

But wait, that introduces an i, which would make the result purely imaginary. But the question asks for the imaginary part, which is a real number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) / (2k ), without the i.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i2δ} -1 ]

The imaginary part of f is Im( (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i2δ} -1 ] )

Which is (1/(2ik)) * Im( sum (2l+1) [e^{i2δ} -1 ] )

The sum is sum (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ) -1 ) + i sin(2δ) ]

So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ )

Thus,

Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2delta )

But 1/(2ik) is -i/(2k )

So,

Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2delta) ] * (-i) / (2k )

But this would make Im(f) a purely imaginary number. So, in terms of real value, the imaginary part would be equal to the coefficient of i.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of magnitude. Because the question is asking for the imaginary part, which is a real quantity.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me try an alternative approach.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1 )

The imaginary part of f is the imaginary part of this expression.

Let me write e^{2iδ_l} -1 = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l)

So,

f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ A + i B ]

Where A = sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 )

B = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So,

f = [ A/(2ik) ) ] + [ i B/(2ik) ]

= [ A/(2ik) ) ] + [ B/(2k) ]

Now, the imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i in the expression.

So, imaginary part is [ B/(2k) ) ]

Because the first term is [ A/(2ik) ), which is (A/(2i k)) = (A * (-i) )/(2 k ), which is a purely imaginary term. But when you take the imaginary part, the coefficient of i is (A * (-1) )/(2k )

Wait, no. Let me compute each part:

f = [ A/(2ik) ) ] + [ B/(2k) ]

The first term is [A/(2ik)] → which can be written as [ (A) * (-i) ]/(2k ), because 1/(ik) = -i/(k )

So,

f = [ (-i A) / (2k) ] + [ B/(2k) ]

The imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i in this sum. The first term contributes (-A)/(2k ), and the second term has no i, so contributes nothing.

Therefore, Im(f) = (-A)/(2k )

But earlier, I had that Im(f) = (18.2049)/(2k ), where A is -18.2049. So,

Im(f) = (- (-18.2049)) / (2k ) → 18.2049/(2k )

Which brings me back to the same result.

So, Im(f) ≈ 35.94 fm.

But this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are given for each l, but I might have misassigned the l values. Let me check the phase shifts again.

The problem states: measured phase shifts δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°.

So, l=0: δ_0=90°, l=1:δ_1=67, etc.

So the sum is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) / (2k )

Which would be sum sin terms multiplied by (2l+1), then divided by 2k.

In that case, the sum of sin terms was 16.864.

So, 16.864/(2k ) → 16.864 / (2 * 0.253 ) → 16.864 /0.506 ≈33.32 fm.

Hmm, which is about 33.3 fm, still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] multiplied by (1/(2k)).

Wait, that would be 16.864/(2k ) →16.864 / (0.506 ) ≈33.32.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again without approximations.

Let me recompute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for each l.

l=0:

(2*0+1) =1 → sin(2*90) = sin(180) =0 → term=0.

l=1:

3 → sin(2*67)= sin(134°) = sin(46°)= approx 0.7193 →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:

5 → sin(110)= sin(70)= approx 0.9397 →5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:

7 → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:

9 → sin(26)= approx 0.4384 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Summing these: 0 + 2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So the sum is 16.864.

Now, 16.864 / (2k ) where k=50/(197.33) ≈0.253.

So 2k=0.506.

16.864 / 0.506 = approx 33.31 fm.

Hmm. Still not matching the options.

Wait, the options are much larger. Perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in units of fm^{-1} correctly.

E=50 MeV.

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

p c= sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p=50 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ) → but ħ is 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k= (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → (50 / 197.33 ) (1/(fm) )

Because MeV cancels, and 1/c is (fm^{-1} ), because c is in fm/s, but perhaps I'm messing up units.

Wait, more accurately, ħ has units of MeV s. So when you compute k = p/(ħ), p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV s.

So,

k = [ (50 MeV/c) ] / ( 197.33 MeV s ) 

= (50 / 197.33 ) * (1/(c s)) 

But c is in fm/s, because 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and c is about 3e8 m/s → 3e8 * 1e-15 =3e-7 fm/s.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps it's easier to compute in natural units where ħ=c=1.

In natural units (ħ= c=1), then:

k = p =50 MeV.

Wait, but in natural units, the scattering amplitude f has units of (energy)^{-1} → MeV^{-1}.

But when we convert to fm, since 1 fm^{-1} = 197.33 MeV (because ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm → (ħ c )^{-1}=1/(197.33 MeV fm) → so 1 fm^{-1} = 197.33 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in MeV and then convert to fm^{-1}.

In natural units, k= p =50 MeV.

Then, to convert to fm^{-1}, since 1 fm^{-1} = 197.33 MeV, then:

k =50 MeV → 50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is the same as before.

So, I think my calculation of k is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the formula uses 2ik or ik in the denominator.

Wait, the original formula for f is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2iδ} -1 )

So, perhaps I should have considered that.

Wait, but regardless, the Im(f) calculation leads me to about 35.9 fm, which is not any of the options. 

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: 355.351 fm → which is 10 times 35.5.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, either in the sum or in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

Which would be 16.864 / (2k ) → 16.864 / (0.506 ) ≈33.31 fm.

But that's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the sum is multiplied by (2l+1) and then each term is multiplied by 2 l +1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, wait, let's recompute the sum.

Each term for l=0 to 4:

l=0: (2*0+1) * sin(2*90) → 1 * sin(180) →0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°) →3 * 0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Adding:

0 +2.1579=2.1579

+4.6985 →6.8564

+6.062 →12.9184

+3.9456 →16.864.

No mistake there.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k)) ), which is approximately 16.864/(0.506 )=33.31 fm.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the sum is sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ) / (2k) ) → 16.864/(2*0.253 )=16.864/0.506 ≈33.31 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] * (1/k )

Which would be 16.864 / 0.253 ≈66.64 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, could the formula be [ sum ... ] * (1/(2k)) * something else, like including a factor of 2? Or perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude is for the elastic scattering, so maybe I should include a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] / (k )

Which would be 16.864 /0.253 ≈66.64 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in the question, but the formula for Im(f) is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

But let's compute 16.864/(2 *0.253 )= 16.864/0.506 ≈33.31 fm.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is 251.271 fm.

Wait, 251.271 is approximately (pi * 80 ), which is about 251.327. So perhaps someone approximated pi as 3.1416.

Wait, but why would that be relevant here?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me re-express the phase shifts in radians and recompute the sines.

Compute each sin(2 delta_l) in radians:

l=1: delta=67° → 2 delta=134° → 134 * pi/180 ≈ 2.340 radians → sin(2.340)= approx 0.7193 → same as before.

l=2:110° → 2*110=220 → 220*pi/180 ≈3.8397 rad → sin(3.8397 )= approx -0.1736 → wait, wait, no, 220 degrees is in the third quadrant. So sin(220) = sin(180+40)= -sin(40)≈-0.6428.

Wait, wait a minute! Oh no! I made a mistake here.

Because 2 delta_l for l=2 is 110 degrees, so 2 delta_l is 220 degrees, not 110. Oh wait, no, delta_l is 55 degrees for l=2. So 2 delta_l is 110 degrees. Oh, wait no! Wait, in the problem statement, the phase shifts are delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, delta_2=55°, delta_3=30°, delta_4=13°.

So for l=2, delta_l is 55°, so 2 delta_l is 110°, which is in the second quadrant. So sin(110°) is sin(70°)=0.9397.

Wait, but I thought earlier that for l=2, delta_l=55, so 2 delta_l=110, which is correct. So sin(110)=0.9397, which is correct.

But for l=3, delta_l=30°, so 2 delta_l=60°, sin=0.8660.

l=4: delta_l=13° → 26°, sin=0.4384.

So no mistake here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) / (2k).

But that would change the sum.

Wait, but why would that be? The formula is based on phase shifts, which are in terms of 2 delta_l.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used delta_l instead of 2 delta_l. Let me try that.

Sum for each l: (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 → sum=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 * 0.9205≈2.7615 → sum=3.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096 → sum=7.8575.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5 → sum=11.3575.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249≈2.024 → sum=13.3815.

Then, Im(f)= sum * (1/(2k )) →13.3815 / (0.506 )≈26.45 fm.

Still not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to take the sum of (2l+1) multiplied by sin(delta_l ), not 2 delta_l.

But that would give me a sum of around 13.38, leading to Im(f)=26.45.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin( delta_l ) * (1/k )

Which would be 13.3815 /0.253 ≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) * (1/(2k)).

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 33.31 fm.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )) * (1/ k )

That would be 16.864 / 0.253 ≈66.64 fm.

Still not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm, which is approximately (pi * 80) → 251.327.

Hmm, no obvious connection.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me think again.

The correct formula for Im(f) at θ=0 is Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) / (2k )

Which is exactly what I have, leading to 33.31 fm.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check with another approach. Let me think about the units.

The cross-section sigma_total is related to Im(f) by sigma_total = 4 pi |f|^2, but more accurately, sigma_total = (4 pi / k^2) Im(f(0)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Which is what I have.

Wait, but if I take the sum as 16.864 and divide by (2k )=0.506, I get 33.31, which is about 33 fm.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I should have converted them to radians before calculating the sine.

Wait, let me try that.

For each l:

l=1: delta=67° → radians=67 * pi/180 ≈1.16937 radians → 2 delta=134° → (2.33874 rad → sin= approx 0.7193 → same as before.

l=2:55° → radians=0.9599 → 2 delta=110° → 1.91986 rad → sin(1.91986 )= approx 0.9397.

l=3:30° → 0.5236 rad → 2 delta=60° →1.0472 rad → sin= approx 0.8660.

l=4:13° →0.2269 rad →2 delta=26° →0.4539 rad → sin= approx 0.4384.

So even when using radians, the sine values are the same as before. So no change in the sum.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

l=0: 1 * sin(180) →0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 → +4.6985=6.8564 → +6.062=12.9184 → +3.9456=16.864.

Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the sum is 16.864 divided by (k ), not 2k.

Which would be 16.864 /0.253 ≈66.64 fm.

But still no option matches.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] * (1/(2k)) * (1/(2m)) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) * (1/(k )).

Which would be 16.864/0.253≈66.64 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) * (1/(2k )) * (2), which would bring it to 66.64.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, the options suggest much larger values, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for k is (E)/(ħ c ), not E/(ħ c ) as I thought.

E=50 MeV.

k= E/(ħ c ) → since ħ c≈197.33 MeV fm, so k=50 /197.33≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, I'm not finding any mistake in my approach, but the calculated value doesn't match any option. Perhaps the correct option is not among the choices, but I must choose the closest one. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] * (1/(2k )) * (2), which would be 33.31 *2=66.62 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum ...) * (1/k ), which would be 16.864/0.253≈66.64 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula actually involves the sum of (2l+1) multiplied by delta_l, not 2 delta_l.

So, sum (2l+1) delta_l (in radians).

But that would be a different approach, and I'm not sure.

Let me compute this:

delta_l in radians:

l=0:90°=pi/2 ≈1.5708 rad. sum term:1 *1.5708=1.5708.

l=1:67°≈1.1694 rad →3 *1.1694≈3.5082 → sum=5.0789.

l=2:55°≈0.9599 →5 *0.9599≈4.7995 → sum=9.8784.

l=3:30°≈0.5236 →7 *0.5236≈3.6652 → sum=13.5436.

l=4:13°≈0.2269 →9 *0.2269≈2.0421 → sum=15.5857.

So sum is approx 15.5857.

Then, if the formula is Im(f)=sum/(2k ), then 15.5857/(0.506 )≈30.76 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should take a different approach. Let's look for any miscalculations in the sum.

Wait, perhaps for l=2, delta_l is 55°, so 2 delta_l is 110°, which is correct. So sin(110)=0.9397.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used sin(2 delta_l in radians) instead of degrees. Let me compute using exact values.

Compute 2 delta_l in radians for each l:

l=0: 180° → pi → sin(pi)=0.

l=1:134° → 134 * pi/180 ≈2.340 rad → sin(2.340)=approx 0.7193.

l=2:110° → (110)*pi/180≈1.91986 rad → sin(1.91986)≈0.9397.

l=3:60° →1.0472 rad → sin(1.0472)=0.8660.

l=4:26° →0.4539 rad → sin(0.4539)=approx 0.4384.

So the sum remains the same.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is none of the options, but based on the options given, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] * (1/k )

Which would be 16.864 /0.253 ≈66.64 fm.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] * (1/(2k )) * 2.

Which would be 16.864/(0.506 ) * 2 → which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= [sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ] * (1/(2k )) * 10.

Which would give 33.31 *10=333.1 fm, which is close to option B (355.351) but not exact.

But I don't see any reason to multiply by 10.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given for each l, and the formula uses sum ( (2l+1) delta_l ), but that doesn't fit with the units.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the question wants the real part instead of the imaginary part, but that doesn't make sense as the formula for real part is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) multiplied by the phase shift itself, not twice the phase shift.

Sum would be:

l=0:1 *90=90 → but in degrees, but when converted to radians, 90 degrees is pi/2 ≈1.5708.

But if we consider the sum in terms of delta_l (in radians), then:

sum (2l+1) delta_l (in radians):

l=0:1 * 1.5708 →1.5708.

l=1:3 * 1.1694 →3.5082 → sum=5.079.

l=2:5 * 0.9599 →4.7995 → sum=9.8785.

l=3:7 *0.5236 →3.6652 → sum=13.5437.

l=4:9 *0.2269 →2.0421 → sum=15.5858.

So sum is 15.5858.

Then, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum * (1/(2k )) →15.5858/(0.506 )≈30.76 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) * (1/k )

Which would be sum=13.3815 (as computed earlier) → 13.3815 /0.253≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, the closest is option D:251.271 fm.

But I don't see how to get that number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) ) multiplied by sin(2 delta_l ) * (1/(2k )) * (something else).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is Im(f) = [ sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ) ] * (1/(2k )) * (something )

But without knowing what that something is, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the formula is Im(f) = [ sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ) ] * (1/k )

Which would be 16.864/0.253≈66.64 fm.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts given are for each partial wave, but in reality, the higher phase shifts may contribute more. But in the problem, they've given phase shifts up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps the sum is correct, but the given options have a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) multiplied by the phase shift, not twice the phase shift.

So sum (2l+1) * delta_l (in radians) would be 15.5858.

Then, Im(f)=15.5858/(2k ) →15.5858/(0.506 )≈30.76 fm.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) * (1/(2k )) * (something like 2pi )

Which would be 16.864 * 3.1416 / 0.506 → (53.0) /0.506 → around 104.7 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute using all the given phase shifts, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) again.

l=0:1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 * 0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum:0+2.1579+4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, I'm not finding any mistake in my approach. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times 35.5.

But why would that be? I don't see any step where I would multiply by 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts were given in radians, but the problem states they are in degrees.

Wait, let me check what happens if I treat the phase shifts as radians.

For l=0: δ_0=90 radians → which is impossible because 90 radians is way more than 180 degrees. So this can't be correct.

Thus, I think my calculation is correct and the answer is approximately 35.94 fm, which is not among the options. But perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is about half of 355.351.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) * (1/(k )) →16.864 /0.253≈66.64 fm.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the formula uses the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (2l+1), not the sine of twice the phase shifts.

But that would be sum (2l+1) delta_l (in radians).

Which gives sum=15.5858.

Im(f)=15.5858/(2k )=15.5858/(0.506 )≈30.76 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer must be option D:251.271 fm.

But how?

Wait, 251.271 is approximately (2 * pi * 40 ), which is about 251.327.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 251.271 * 0.253 ≈63.68.

Hmm, 63.68 would be the sum if 251.271 = sum/(2k )

Sum would be 251.271 * 2k = 251.271 *0.506 ≈127.03.

But my sum is 16.864, which is much less.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make a guess based on the calculations, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm.

But I don't see how to get that number.

Wait, 355.351 is approximately 10 times 35.535, which is around the value I calculated.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm.

But I don't know why the factor of 10 would be included.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as (E) / (ħ ), not (E)/(ħ c ), but that would give an incorrect unit.

Wait, ħ has units of MeV s. So, k= p/(ħ ), and p is (E/c ) → E in MeV, c in units that would give p in MeV/fm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong.

Let me compute k correctly.

p c = sqrt( (50 MeV )^2 - (0.511 MeV )^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV / c.

k= p/(ħ ) → p in MeV/c, ħ in MeV s.

But to get k in fm^{-1}, I need to express p in MeV/(fm/s) → because c is in fm/s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

k = (p c ) / ( ħ c ) → since p c is 50 MeV, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find an error in my approach. So I'll conclude that the correct answer is approximately 35.94 fm, but since none of the options match, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement or options.

But given that, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times my result. So perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= sum * (1/(2k )) *10.

But without any justification, I can't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:251.271 fm, which is approximately (pi * 80 ) → 251.327.

But I don't see any connection between the sum and pi.

Well, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic electron scattering at the incident beam direction, given the phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}, \quad \text{with } \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $k$
The electron energy is $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$. Using the relativistic relation:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum $\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$
For each $l$, $(2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$ is calculated as follows:

- $l=0$: $(2(0)+1) \sin(2 \cdot 90^\circ) = 1 \cdot \sin(180^\circ) = 0$.
- $l=1$: $(2(1)+1) \sin(2 \cdot 67^\circ) = 3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.7193 = 2.1579$.
- $l=2$: $(2(2)+1) \sin(2 \cdot 55^\circ) = 5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985$.
- $l=3$: $(2(3)+1) \sin(2 \cdot 30^\circ) = 7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062$.
- $l=4$: $(2(4)+1) \sin(2 \cdot 13^\circ) = 9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456$.

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) = 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\text{Im}(f(0))$
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

substitute $k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$ and $\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 16.864$:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.506} \approx 33.31 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of $\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 33.31 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which is approximately 10 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or a missing factor in the formula. Given the options, **B) 355.351 fm** is selected as the most plausible answer, assuming the factor of 10 is intended.
