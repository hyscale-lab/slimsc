Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that |alpha> is the state of an electron, and it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, wait, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I'm dealing with a spin-½ system, right? Because electrons have spin-½, so their spin states are two-dimensional.

The question then asks me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by elements A_ij, where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because the state is given as proportional to that combination, so I have to find the normalization constant.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's write it as a vector. In the basis |up>, |down>, the state is [1+i, 2-i]^T.

To find the normalization, I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself. The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose times the vector. So the inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i). Let me compute each term.

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) +i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². Wait, but that's probably better to compute as (a+bi)(a-bi) = a² + b². So (1+i)(1-i)= 1^2 +1^2=2.

Wait, wait, 1+i multiplied by 1-i is (1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Right, so that's 2. The second term is (2-i)(2+i). Again, same approach: (2)^2 - (i)^2 =4 - (-1)=5.

So the inner product is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> .

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. The state is (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down>, so when I compute <alpha|alpha>, it's (1-i)(1+i) + (2 +i)(2 -i). Because |up> is the first component, so when you take the conjugate, it becomes (1-i), and similarly (2+i) for the second component.

Wait, no, wait, the inner product is <alpha|alpha> = [ (1-i), (2 +i) ] multiplied by [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

So first component: (1-i)(1+i) = 1 + i -i -i² = 1 - (-1) = 2. Second component: (2+i)(2 -i) =4 - (i)^2 =4 - (-1) =5. So total is 2+5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Okay, so that's done. Now, the operator whose matrix is A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So what's the matrix form of A?

The operator is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-½. So in the computational basis |up>, |down>, the matrix would have zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

So A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ].

Wait, wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So in the basis of |up> and |down>, the matrix is:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]

Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

So that's the matrix.

Now, the problem is about finding the eigenstates of this operator A. Because the question says, the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Let me think about matrix A. It's a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So this is a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

The matrix A can be written as (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Because [[0,1],[1,0]] is a Pauli matrix, sigma_x. So A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Wait, sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by (hbar/2), the eigenvalues become (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait, the eigenvectors of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are those combinations.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

So, the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

But wait, perhaps I should write them correctly. Wait, sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, but actually, the eigenvectors are:

Wait, sigma_x has eigenvectors [1, 0] and [0,1] perhaps? No, wait, no. Let me actually compute the eigenvectors.

The matrix sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

For eigenvalue 1: (sigma_x - I)|v> = 0.

So [[-1,1],[1,-1]] |v> =0. The equations are -v1 + v2=0 and v1 -v2=0. So v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is [1,1]^T, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), as I said.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1: sigma_x + I = [[1,1],[1,1]]. So equations are v1 + v2=0. So v2 = -v1. So eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are the superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Now, the question is, given the state |alpha>, what is the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x> ), and what is the average value of A.

So to find the probabilities, I need to expand |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, and square the coefficients to get the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is in the z-basis. So I can express |alpha> in terms of the x-basis.

Alternatively, I can compute <v|alpha>, where v is each eigenstate of A.

So let's compute the components.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Expressed in the z-basis, that's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the coefficients when |alpha> is expressed in the x-basis, we compute the inner product between |alpha> and each |+x> and |-x>.

Let me compute c_+ = < +x | alpha > and c_- = < -x | alpha >.

c_+ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1,1) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

So c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ]

Simplify numerator: 1 + 2 + i -i =3. So 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Thus c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1, -1) ] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= [ (1+i -2 +i )/( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), so |c_+|^2 = 9/14.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 = [ (-1 + 2i) * (-1 - 2i) ] / (14) = [ (1 + 2i -2i -4i² ) ] /14.

Wait, compute numerator: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. Because (a + b i)(a - b i)=a² + b².

So |c_-|^2 = (1 +4) /14 =5/14.

Wait, wait: (-1 + 2i) multiplied by (-1 - 2i) is 1 + (2i)(-i) + etc. Let me compute it properly.

(-1 + 2i)(-1 -2i) = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i).

Which is 1 + 2i -2i -4i².

Simplify: 1 + (2i -2i) + (-4*(-1)).

So 1 +0 +4 =5. So yes, |c_-|^2 is 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36... but the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, the average value of the operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Hmm, but I can compute that.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, and sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], let me compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

So |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So sigma_x |alpha> would swap the components and take complex conjugate? No, wait, sigma_x is the matrix, so it's:

sigma_x |alpha> = [ [0 1], [1 0] ] * |alpha>

Which becomes [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, the inner product <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] · [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Compute each component:

First term: (1-i)(2 -i)/7.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Compute each:

First term: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

Which is 2 - 3i -1 =1 -3i.

Second term: (2)(1) + (2)(i) + (i)(1) + (i)(i) =2 + 2i +i +i².

Which is 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So total inner product is (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Wait, but wait, sigma_x is an operator. So the expectation value of sigma_x is 2/7?

Wait, no, no. Wait, the inner product is (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 =2/7. So sigma_x has expectation value 2/7.

Wait, but since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar /7.

So now, the probability of |+x> is 9/14 ≈0.6428, which is about 0.64, and the probability for |-x> is 5/14 ≈0.357, about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

But let me double-check the probabilities. Because in our calculation, |c_+|^2 is 9/14 ≈0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. Similarly, 5/14 is ≈0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So the first part of the answer is probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, and average hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's matching.

Wait, but looking at the other options. Option B says probabilities 0.54 and 0.46, which would sum to 1.0, but 9/14 is about 0.64 and 5/14 is about 0.36, so option A is the correct probabilities.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but another approach: let's compute the average value another way. Since A is given by the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], the expectation value is the same as the matrix element of A in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

So, A is the matrix:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then A |alpha> is [ (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then <alpha| A |alpha> is the dot product of [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] with A|alpha>.

Which is (1-i)/sqrt(7)*(hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7)*(hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7).

Factor out (hbar/2)/7.

So first term: (1 -i)(2 -i) → 2 -i -2i +i² → 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) → 2(1) +2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So total is [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] = 2.

Multiply by (hbar/2)/7 → (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/(7).

So same result. So the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

So the correct answer is option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

The problem involves an electron in a spin-½ system, described by the state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down\rangle,
\]

where \( |up\rangle \) and \( |down\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]

which corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up\rangle + |down\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up\rangle - |down\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates. The coefficients are:

\[
c_{+} = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
c_{-} = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_{+}|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_{-}|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Next, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we compute \( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \). Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) into the matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \), we find:

\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Probabilities: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), Average value: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**

Answer: A
