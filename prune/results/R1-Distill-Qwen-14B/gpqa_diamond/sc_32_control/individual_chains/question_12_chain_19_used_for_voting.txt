Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) muon and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the decay products should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny mass—almost considered massless. So maybe the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon. So perhaps the muon's momentum is approximately equal to the neutrino's, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should model this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me consider the decay equation: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The energy of each product is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu, and E_nu = p_nu c (since neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so E≈pc). But wait, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the vectors of the muon and neutrino momenta must cancel each other out. Let’s denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum must be p as well but in the opposite direction. Wait, but neutrinos are leptons with their own momentum direction. Wait, no, perhaps the momenta are opposite vectors. But the muon and neutrino would have the same magnitude of momentum? Because if the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so p_mu + p_nu =0. So p_nu = -p_mu. But in terms of magnitude, |p_mu|=|p_nu|=p.

Wait, but neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass, so their energy is approximately E_nu = p c. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV. So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 ). And E_nu = p c.

So the equation becomes sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.

But since the units are in MeV, and c is in units that make c=1 (like in particle physics), perhaps I can ignore c for simplicity. So the equation simplifies to sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Let me denote x = p. Then the equation is sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, I can rearrange this. Let me move x to the other side: sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides: x² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + 105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

The x² terms cancel out on both sides.

So,

105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x.

Let me compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112=19488; 19488 +0.16=19488.16 (MeV squared).

105.7^2: Let's compute 105^2=11025, 0.7^2=0.49, 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Rearranging,

2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67.

Wait, 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So,

x= 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2= 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, wait, 279.2 *30=8376, so that's over 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps a better approach.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

279.2 * 30 = 8376.

So 279.2 *29.7 = 8376 - 279.2 *0.3 = 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24.

Wait, 8292.24 is less than 8315.67. So 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43.

So 23.43 /279.2 ≈ 0.0839.

So x≈29.7 + 0.0839 ≈ 29.7839.

So x≈29.78 MeV/c (since we're using units where c=1).

Wait, but wait, x is p, so the neutrino's momentum is about 29.78 MeV/c. The muon has the same magnitude of momentum, 29.78 MeV/c in the opposite direction.

Wait, no. Wait, the neutrino's momentum is p, and the muon's momentum is also p. But they are opposite, so their vector sum is zero. So the magnitudes are both p.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So the muon's momentum is 29.78 MeV/c.

The muon's energy is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), which would be sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Wait, 29.78 squared is approximately 886.88 (since 30^2=900, so 29.78^2 is like 886).

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 886.88 + 11172.49 = 12059.37.

Square root of that is sqrt(12059.37) ≈ around 109.8 something MeV.

Wait, 109.8 squared is 12056.04, which is close to 12059.37. So the muon's energy is approximately 109.8 MeV.

But wait, earlier I had the equation that E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV, right? Because E_mu is 109.8, and E_nu is p*c = 29.78, so 109.8 +29.78=139.58, which is approximately 139.6. That checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c². So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV approximately.

Wait, but wait, 109.8 is the energy, and 105.7 is the rest mass, so yes, K_mu is about 4.1 MeV.

What about the neutrino's kinetic energy? Well, neutrinos are nearly massless, so their energy is E_nu = p c ≈ 29.78 MeV. So their kinetic energy is approximately equal to their energy, since their rest mass energy is negligible. So K_nu ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculations. So the muon has KE≈4.1 MeV, the neutrino≈29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy, since its rest mass is negligible. So in the problem, the question is asking for the KE of the product particles. So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Option B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, am I missing something here? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me retrace.

So, the equation was:

sqrt(x^2 + m_mu^2) + x = m_pi.

Where m_pi=139.6, m_mu=105.7.

So, sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Solving for x.

I found x ≈29.78.

So the muon's KE is E_mu - m_mu = sqrt(x^2 + m_mu^2) - m_mu.

Which gives sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2) is sqrt(886.8 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29)≈109.8.

So 109.8-105.7=4.1 MeV. So the muon's KE is approximately 4.1 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is x, which is approximately 29.78 MeV.

So the product particles' KEs are 4.1 and 29.8, which matches option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that should be the correct answer.

But another thought: wait, the neutrino is part of the decay products, so the problem is correct in considering both particles. But in reality, neutrinos are hard to detect because they have such low mass and high energy, but in this problem, we're assuming it's part of the decay.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Maybe I should compute x more accurately.

So, when I had 105.7^2 =11172.49, and 139.6^2=19488.16.

Then, 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

So 2*139.6 x =8315.67.

So x=8315.67/(2*139.6)=8315.67/(279.2) ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So the calculations seem right.

Another approach: perhaps I should use exact values.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

So 279.2 × 0.78 = ?

0.7 *279.2=195.44.

0.08*279.2=22.336.

So 195.44 +22.336=217.776.

So 0.78 *279.2=217.776.

We have 218.87 left, which is 218.87 -217.776=1.094.

So 1.094/279.2 ≈0.00392.

So total x=29.78 +0.00392≈29.7839.

So x≈29.7839 MeV/c.

So the muon's KE is 109.808 MeV (wait, let me compute sqrt(29.7839^2 +105.7^2)).

29.7839^2 = (approx) 29.78^2 = 886.8.

Wait, 29.7839^2 = (30-0.2161)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.2161 + (0.2161)^2.

=900 - 12.966 + 0.0467.

=900 -12.966=887.034 +0.0467=887.0807.

So 887.0807 + 11172.49 = 12059.5707.

sqrt(12059.5707) ≈109.81 MeV.

So E_mu=109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu=109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

Hmm, so approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon, and the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. So the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says 4.12 and 29.8. That's very close to our calculated 4.11 and 29.78. So I think option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Given:**
- Rest mass of the pion, \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of the muon, \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- The pion is stationary, so the total initial momentum is zero.

**Key Equations:**
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi^+} c^2
   \]
   Since the pion is at rest, \( c = 1 \) in natural units, so:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   The total momentum after the decay must be zero. Let the magnitude of the muon's momentum be \( p \). Since the neutrino is nearly massless, its energy is \( E_{\nu} = p \), and its momentum is also \( p \) but in the opposite direction to the muon. Thus, \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \).

3. **Energy of the Muon:**  
   The energy of the muon is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
   \]

**Solving for \( p \):**
Substitute \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p \) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Rearrange:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Square both sides:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expand the right-hand side:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]
Cancel \( p^2 \) from both sides:  
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Rearrange to solve for \( p \):  
\[
2(139.6)p = 139.6^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
Substitute \( m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 \):  
\[
2(139.6)p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.
\]
Compute \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):  
\[
2(139.6)p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Solve for \( p \):  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2(139.6)} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

**Kinetic Energy of the Muon:**
The total energy of the muon is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]
Substitute \( p = 29.78 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \):  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Compute \( 29.78^2 \approx 887.08 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.08 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.57} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

**Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino:**
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum (since its rest mass is negligible):  
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Thus, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

**Final Answer:**
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
