Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. I need to calculate the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Hmm. So the direction n lies in the x-z plane, which means it's in the horizontal plane, not the y-axis. So the direction vector n would have components (something, 0, something) because y is zero. Oh wait, but the operator here is P, which I think refers to the momentum operator or maybe the spin operator? Because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the components are given as matrices. So P is a vector operator, and each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]], right? Similarly for P_y and P_z.

So the operator P has components along x, y, and z. But the question is about the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n would be a unit vector, let's say (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero? Because if it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero in spherical coordinates. Or wait, maybe it's better to define n as (nx, 0, nz), with nx² + nz² =1.

So the operator P in the direction n is P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each P component is a matrix, so substituting in:

P_n = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

That would give us the matrix for the operator P along direction n.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to solve (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write down the matrix P_n.

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because:
- The (1,1) element is n_z*(1) from P_z, since P_z's first row is [1,0], multiplied by ħ/2. Then P_x's (1,1) is 0, so the (1,1) element of P_n is n_z*(1) * (ħ/2).
- The (1,2) element is n_x from P_x, which is 1 in the first row, multiplied by (ħ/2).
Similarly, the (2,1) element is n_x*(ħ/2), and (2,2) is -n_z*(ħ/2).

So P_n is:
[[ (n_z ħ/2), (n_x ħ/2) ],
 [ (n_x ħ/2), ( -n_z ħ/2 ) ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P_n - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. We're looking for λ = +ħ/2.

So subtract (ħ/2) I from P_n:

P_n - (ħ/2) I = [[ (n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2 ), (n_x ħ/2) ],
                [ (n_x ħ/2 ), ( -n_z ħ/2 - ħ/2 ) ] ]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x ],
           [n_x, (-n_z -1) ] ]

So the matrix becomes:
[ [n_z -1, n_x], 
  [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

We need to find the eigenvector for this matrix, which corresponds to the eigenvalue equation.

The eigenvector v = [a, b]^T, and when we apply the matrix to v, it should give zero.

So, the equations are:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These are two equations. Let me write them:

1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

I can write these as a system:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b  --> equation (1)
n_x a = (n_z +1 ) b  --> equation (2)

Let me solve for a and b.

From equation (1): a = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] b

But let's substitute a from equation (1) into equation (2).

n_x [ (-n_x / (n_z -1) ) b ] = (n_z + 1) b

Left side: ( -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ) b 
Right side: (n_z +1 ) b

Divide both sides by b (assuming b ≠ 0, which it can't be because then a would be zero, leading to a trivial solution).

So:

- n_x^2 / (n_z - 1) = (n_z + 1)

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1)
= n_z^2 -1

So:

- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1
Which rearranges to:

n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1.

Which is correct because n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1. So that's consistent.

So, now I can express a in terms of b. Let's take equation (1):

a = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] b

But wait, let's see if we can write it in terms of a ratio.

Let me write a = k * b, where k is a constant.

From equation (1):

k = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

From equation (2):

n_x k = (n_z + 1 )

Substituting k from above:

n_x * [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] = n_z +1 

Which simplifies to:

- n_x² / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1 )

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x² = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 )

Which again gives:

- n_x² = n_z² -1 

Which is correct as before.

So, the ratio a/b is k = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

Hmm. Let's pick b as a parameter, say set b = 1 (up to normalization). Then a = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

But wait, maybe it's easier to express this in terms of the angles. Since n is in the x-z plane, we can write n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), since for a direction in x-z plane, θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, wait, no, wait. If n is in the x-z plane, then direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ ), where θ is measured from the z-axis. So in that case, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Ah, because in spherical coordinates, n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ.

But since n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0. So n_x = sinθ * cos(0) = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So our ratio a/b is [ - sinθ ] / ( cosθ - 1 )

Wait, let's compute this.

k = [ - sinθ ] / ( cosθ -1 )

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this expression. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ +1 ) to rationalize.

So,

k = [ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ]

Denominator becomes cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So,

k = [ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / ( - sin²θ )

Simplify:

The negatives cancel, and denominator is sin²θ:

k = [ sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / sin²θ = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

So,

a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * b

But let me think, this is a ratio, so perhaps expressing it as a = (cosθ +1 )/(sinθ) * b. Let's see.

Alternatively, I can write a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b

Hmm. Let me see this ratio. Let's try to simplify it.

(1 + cosθ)/sinθ can be rewritten using trigonometric identities.

We know that (1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

(1 + cosθ)/sinθ = [ 2 cos²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2 )

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Therefore, the eigenvector components a and b are related by a = cot(θ/2) b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ]^T = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ]^T.

We can factor out b, and write the vector as b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The vector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

The squared magnitude is cot²(θ/2) + 1 = csc²(θ/2) = 1/sin²(θ/2).

So the normalization factor is sqrt( sin²(θ/2) ) = sin(θ/2) / sqrt( cot²(...) +1 )

Wait, actually, the norm squared is cot²(θ/2) + 1 = (cos² + sin² ) / sin² = 1/sin².

So the norm is 1/sin(θ/2). So the normalized vector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Simplify:

cot(θ/2) is cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so multiplying by sin(θ/2) gives cos(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, wait, no. Let me check.

The vector before normalization is [ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ].

Let's factor out b: b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

The norm squared is [cot²(θ/2) +1 ] b² = [ (cos² + sin² ) / sin² ] b² = (1 / sin² ) b².

So to make it unit length, set b² (1/sin² ) = 1 → b = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so:

[ ( cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ) * sin(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but this is a 2-component vector. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But let me check the options again.

Option C says: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D looks more complicated: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). Hmm, but in our calculation, the eigenvector has no factors of ħ because the eigenvalue is ħ/2. Wait, no, the eigenvector's components are in the vector space, not multiplied by ħ. So the options shouldn't have ħ in them unless it's part of a notation, but I think in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are unit vectors, so their components are dimensionless.

Wait, looking back, the given options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, our result is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But let me think again. Because in my calculation, I considered the normalized eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, in the problem statement, the operator P has components that are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, perhaps. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

So the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector depends on theta, the angle from the z-axis. So indeed, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C matches this.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, the spin-up state along direction n is written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ], but since phi is zero in this case because n is in the x-z plane (i.e., phi = 0), then the second component is just sin(theta/2). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each of which is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator along $\vec{n}$ is $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ gives:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector $|v\rangle = [a, b]^T$ must satisfy the equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]

From these equations, the ratio $a/b$ is found to be:

\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1}.
\]

Using the fact that $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, and substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$, $n_z = \cos\theta$, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}.
\]

Expressing $a$ and $b$ in terms of $\theta$, the eigenvector becomes proportional to:

\[
[a, b]^T = [\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)]^T.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, the components are already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
[\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)]^T.
\]

Among the given options, this matches **Option C**.
