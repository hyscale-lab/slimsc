Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about energy levels and their lifetimes, and how to distinguish between them.

So, the setup: two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly resolve these two levels.

Wait, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

But wait, what's the uncertainty in time here? The lifetimes given are for each state. I think the relevant time here is the lifetime of the state, because that's how long the system stays in that state before decaying or something. So the uncertainty in time Δt would be the lifetime of the state. But since we're looking to distinguish between the two states, I think we need to consider the energy difference relative to the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, but if each state has its own lifetime, maybe we need to consider both. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. For them to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Otherwise, we can't tell them apart because they might blur together.

So, the idea is that for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ divided by the lifetime. So, ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So, if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties, then they can be resolved.

Wait, but wait. Each state has its own ΔE. Oh, no, wait, no—actually, the energy difference ΔE between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each state's energy, otherwise the difference might be smaller than the uncertainties, making it impossible to resolve. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the combined uncertainty when measuring the energy difference. Let me think again.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for each state gives the uncertainty in their energies. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ divided by their lifetime. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

But I'm not sure if the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than either of these uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the maximum of the two uncertainties, then maybe they can't be distinguished.

Wait, let's compute those uncertainties. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But since the answer options are in eV, I should convert ħ into eV·s. Let's see, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So:

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s
= 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19 eV·s
≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for each energy level:

E1 lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.
ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 ≈ 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.
ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 ≈ 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for E1 and E2 respectively.

But wait, the energy difference between E1 and E2 is what we're looking for. So, the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|.

To clearly resolve them, we'd need ΔE to be much larger than the uncertainty of each state. Wait, but which uncertainty? Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty, or the sum? Hmm.

Wait, when you have two states, the uncertainty in the energy measurement for each would be their own ΔE. So for the two states to be distinguishable, ΔE (the difference) must be significantly larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties.

So in this case, the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 * 1e-7 eV → way less than 6.58e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e4 bigger than 6.58e-7. So 1e-4 eV is 1e4 * 6.58e-7 eV = 6.58e-3 eV. So 1e-4 is bigger than 6.5e-7, so it's well above the uncertainty of E1, which is the larger uncertainty.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 1.5e-1 times 6.58e-7. Wait, 6.58e-7 is approximately 6.58e-7 = 6.58 * 1e-7. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, so it's 0.1 * 1e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 6.58e-7. So that's not enough.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV. Because that's much larger than both uncertainties, so the two states can be clearly distinguished.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (here, the lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. Converting \( \hbar \) into electron volts-seconds (\( \text{eV} \cdot \text{s} \)), we have:

\[
\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV} \cdot \text{s}.
\]

For each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau},
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Calculating the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be significantly larger than the maximum uncertainty, which is \( \Delta E_1 \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly resolve the two energy levels.
