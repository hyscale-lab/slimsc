Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The info given is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. But the main point is about their luminosities, which are to be compared.

The question states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor given in the options. And they assume the stars radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that luminosity relates to the radius and temperature of a star. The formula for luminosity (L) of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Wait, but in this problem, they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait no, if λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2. Because λ_max ∝ 1/T. So if their λ_max is same, T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but Star_1 and Star_2 both have same T? So T1 = T2.

So then, their luminosities can be compared based on their radii alone because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is same for both, L is proportional to R².

So Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 = (R1² / R2²) * L2. Because L is proportional to R squared. So substituting R1 = 1.5 R2, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor would be 2.25 times. So that's about option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does this affect the calculation?

Hmm, because when a star is moving, its observed wavelength can be affected by the Doppler effect. Since the peak wavelength they observe is the same. Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max are the same. But the actual λ_max is determined by their temperature, but Doppler shift can change the observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. The problem states that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars.

So if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would change. So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that would cause a Doppler shift. So the observed λ_max would be different from the actual λ_max.

Wait, but the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So even though Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max is the same as Star_1's. So I think this would imply that the actual λ_max of Star_2 (before Doppler shift) is different.

Wait no, let me clarify. The peak emission wavelength observed is the same. So the stars' own λ_max (given by Wien's law) would be different if their velocities are different.

Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to model it.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: observed λ_max1 = actual λ1 * Doppler factor.

Similarly, Star_2: observed λ_max2 = actual λ2 * Doppler factor.

The problem states that λ_max1 = λ_max2 = same value, say λ_obs.

So λ_obs = λ1 * (1 + v1/c), assuming v is radial velocity towards us (so blueshift), but wait, the sign depends on direction. Star_1 has v=0, so λ_obs1 = λ1.

Star_2 has v=700 km/s. But wait, what's the direction? Since radial velocity is towards us or away? Because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer (redshift), and if moving towards, it's shorter (blueshift).

Wait, the problem says Star_1's radial velocity is 0, Star_2's is 700 km/s. It doesn't specify the direction, but I think in Doppler shift, the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) if moving away, but wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me recall the Doppler shift formula for light.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the velocity away from the observer. If the star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If moving towards (v negative), observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

But in this problem, Star_2's velocity is given as 700 km/s. Since Star_1 has 0 velocity, perhaps Star_2's velocity is towards or away from us.

Wait, but the problem says the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_1's λ_max is λ1 = b / T1, and Star_2's λ2 = b / T2.

But observed λ1 is λ1 (since v1=0).

Observed λ2 is λ2 * Doppler factor, which depends on its velocity.

So the observed λ_max for both is the same: λ_obs = λ1 = λ2 * Doppler factor.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me set it up:

For Star_1: observed λ1 = λ1_rest (since v=0).

For Star_2: observed λ2 = λ2_rest * Doppler shift factor.

And according to the problem, observed λ1 = observed λ2.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

We know λ_rest is related to temperature via λ_rest = b / T.

So λ1_rest = (b) / T1, λ2_rest = (b) / T2.

So substituting into the observed equality:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * Doppler factor.

Cancel b from both sides: (1/T1) = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

So Doppler factor = (T2 / T1).

Hmm, but the Doppler factor depends on the velocity. So let's write the Doppler factor as (sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )) ), but I'm not sure about the sign. Wait, if the star is moving away, then observed wavelength is longer, so Doppler factor is greater than 1. If moving towards, it's less than 1.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards).

So for Star_2, since its velocity is 700 km/s, but we don't know the direction. Let's make an assumption that it's moving away, so v_r is positive.

So, for Star_2, observed λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) )

We know that observed λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v1=0).

And, observed λ_obs1 = observed λ_obs2, so:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) )

But λ_rest is b / T, so:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) )

Cancel b:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) )

Rearranging:

(T2 / T1) = sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) )

But v is 700 km/s. Let me compute v/c.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333... So approximately 0.002333.

So 1 + v/c is about 1.002333, and 1 - v/c is about 0.997667.

Calculating (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.004675. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.002333 / 0.997667 = approximately 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ Let me compute 1.002333 ÷ 0.997667.

Let me compute 1.002333 ÷ 0.997667:

It's roughly (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333/(0.997667) ≈ Let me compute this.

Let me compute 0.997667 * 1.00467 ≈ 0.997667 * 1.00467 ≈ 1.00233, which matches the numerator.

So sqrt(1.00467) ≈ approximately 1.00233, because (1.00233)^2 ≈ 1.00467.

Wait, because (1+x)^2 ≈ 1+2x when x is small. So for x=0.00233, (1.00233)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00233) = 1.00466, which is roughly the same as 1.00467. So sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So the ratio (T2 / T1) ≈ 1.00233.

Which implies that T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 is a bit higher than T1.

But wait, earlier I thought that the observed λ_max is same, so:

λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Which, after the Doppler effect, would mean that T2 is T1 multiplied by the Doppler factor.

Hmm, but perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me write the Doppler effect formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed wavelength λ_obs is the same for both stars. So λ_obs = λ1 (since Star_1 is at rest) = λ2 * Doppler factor.

So λ_obs = λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), because Star_2 is moving.

Wait, but λ_obs is the same for both. So:

λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ1 = b / T1, and λ2 = b / T2.

Substituting:

(b/T1) = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But v is 700 km/s, and c is 3e5 km/s, so v/c ≈ 0.002333.

So (1 + v/c) is approximately 1.002333, (1 - v/c) is approximately 0.997667.

So (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.004675.

So sqrt(1.004675) ≈ approximately 1.002335.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002335.

So T2 is a bit larger than T1.

But wait, earlier I thought that the observed λ_max being the same would imply T1 = T2, but that seems not to be the case because Doppler shift comes into play.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I thought that since the observed λ_max is the same, and without Doppler shift, T would be same. But because Star_2 is moving, the actual T can be different.

So in reality, the actual temperatures T1 and T2 are such that when considering the Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is same.

Thus, T2 is higher than T1 by a small factor.

So now, back to the luminosity calculation. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

And T1 = T2 / 1.002335.

Wait, wait. Wait, earlier I had T2 = T1 * 1.002335, so T1 = T2 / 1.002335.

Which is approximately T1 ≈ 0.997667 * T2.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002335.

So to compute L1 and L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = (2.25) R2².

So R1²/R2² = 2.25.

Now, T1 = T2 / 1.002335.

So T1^4 = (T2^4) / (1.002335)^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1.002335)^4.

Calculate (1.002335)^4.

Since 1.002335 is approximately 1.002335, and to the fourth power:

We can approximate using (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + n x for small x.

x is 0.002335, n=4.

So (1.002335)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002335) = 1 + 0.00934 = 1.00934.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 1/1.00934 ≈ 0.9907.

So now, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

What's 2.25 * 0.9907? Let me calculate:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

Then, 2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So L1/L2 ≈ approximately 2.229. Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is close to 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, perhaps my approximation is a bit rough. Let me do a more accurate calculation.

Let me compute (1.002335)^4 precisely.

1.002335^2 = (1 + 0.002335)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.002335) + (0.002335)^2 ≈ 1.00467 + 0.00000545 = approx 1.00467545.

Then, 1.00467545^2 = (1.004675)^2.

Compute 1.004675 * 1.004675.

Let me compute this:

1.004675 * 1.004675.

Multiply 1.004675 by 1.004675:

= (1 + 0.004675)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.004675) + (0.004675)^2.

= 1 + 0.00935 + 0.00002186 ≈ 1.00937186.

So (1.002335)^4 ≈ 1.009372.

So 1/(1.009372) ≈ 0.99073.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 0.99073.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99073 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but what if Star_2 is moving towards us? Then the Doppler factor would be less than 1, so the observed wavelength would be shorter. So in that case, would T2 be larger or smaller?

Wait, let me reconsider the Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, observed λ2 would be less than λ2_rest.

But in our problem, observed λ1 = observed λ2.

So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ2 would be less than λ2_rest. So for Star_1, observed λ1 is λ1_rest.

So for Star_2, observed λ2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), if moving towards (v is negative, but in the formula, perhaps v is positive if moving away).

Wait, the Doppler formula for light (for wavelength) is a bit tricky. Let me get it right.

The correct formula for the observed wavelength λ_obs is given by:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards).

So if Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r is negative.

So for Star_2, v_r = -700 km/s. So the formula becomes:

λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - 700/c)/(1 + 700/c) )

Compute this.

v_r = -700 => substituting:

λ_obs2 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 - (700/3e5)) / (1 + (700/3e5)) )

= λ2 * sqrt( (0.997667) / (1.002333) )

= λ2 * sqrt(0.99534) )

So sqrt(0.99534) is approximately 0.99767.

So λ_obs2 ≈ λ2 * 0.99767.

But Star_1's observed λ is λ1. So:

λ_obs1 = λ1.

λ_obs2 = 0.99767 * λ2.

But according to the problem, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 => λ1 = 0.99767 * λ2.

But λ is inversely proportional to T: λ = b / T.

So λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2.

So substituting:

b/T1 = 0.99767 * (b / T2 )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = 0.99767 / T2.

=> T2 = T1 * 0.99767.

So T2 is less than T1.

Wait, this is the opposite scenario of moving away. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is shorter than its rest λ, so to have the same observed λ as Star_1 (which is at rest), Star_2's rest λ must be longer, implying Star_2's temperature is lower.

Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is shorter, so to have the same observed λ as Star_1 (which has λ1 = λ_rest1), Star_2's observed λ2 must be λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

So for Star_2 moving towards, Doppler factor less than 1, so λ_obs2 is less than λ_rest2.

But in our problem, λ_obs1 (which is λ_rest1) is equal to λ_obs2.

So λ_rest1 = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

So if Doppler factor is less than 1 (because moving towards), this would imply that λ_rest1 < λ_rest2.

Which implies that T1 > T2 (since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T).

So in this case, T1 is larger than T2.

So let's recompute the ratio.

In this case, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ), where v=700 km/s.

So (1 - v/c) = 0.997667, (1 + v/c)=1.002333.

So the Doppler factor is sqrt( 0.997667 / 1.002333 ) ≈ sqrt(0.99534) ≈ 0.99767.

So, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.99767.

Which equals λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Thus, λ_rest1 = 0.99767 * λ_rest2.

But λ_rest = b / T, so:

b / T1 = 0.99767 * (b / T2 )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = 0.99767 / T2.

=> T2 = T1 * 0.99767.

So T2 = 0.99767 T1.

So T1 is larger than T2.

Wait, but that's different from the earlier scenario where Star_2 was moving away, which would have made T2 larger than T1.

So in this case, when Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed λ would be same, but T1 would be larger than T2.

Now, let's compute L1/L2 again.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 => R1² = 2.25 R2². So R1²/R2² = 2.25.

And T1 = T2 / 0.99767 ≈ T2 * 1.002335.

So T1 = 1.002335 T2.

So T1^4 = (1.002335)^4 T2^4.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = (1.002335)^4 ≈ 1.00937.

Which, when multiplied by 2.25, gives 2.25 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.2708.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps my initial assumption was correct that Star_2 is moving away, giving L1/L2 as ~2.23, which is option D.

Wait, in the first case, when Star_2 was moving away, L1/L2 came out to be approximately 2.23. When moving towards, it's 2.27, which doesn't match any option.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same. So regardless of the direction, we need to compute the correct T ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more accurately.

Let me recompute without making approximations.

The problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars.

So, observed λ_max = same for both.

Using Doppler shift, observed λ_max = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But since Star_1 has v_r = 0, λ_obs1 = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s, and we don't know direction.

So, λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

But λ is proportional to 1/T. So λ_rest = b/T.

So, (b/T1) = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

But v_r is the radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive. If moving towards, v_r is negative.

Case 1: Star_2 moving away, v_r = +700.

Then,

sqrt( (1 + 700/c)/(1 - 700/c) ) = sqrt( (3e5 +700)/(3e5-700) ) ) = sqrt( (300700)/(299300) ) ≈ sqrt( (300700/299300) )

= sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00233.

So T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.00233.

So, T1^4 = (T2^4) / (1.00233)^4 ≈ T2^4 / 1.00937.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 * T1^4) / (R2^2 * T2^4) ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T2^4 / 1.00937) ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 ) )

Simplify: (2.25 R2^2 / R2^2 ) * (1 / 1.00937) = 2.25 * (1 / 1.00937).

Calculate 1/1.00937 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23 (option D).

Case 2: Star_2 moving towards us, v_r = -700.

Then,

sqrt( (1 + (-700)/c ) / (1 - (-700)/c ) ) = sqrt( (1 - 700/c)/(1 + 700/c) )

Which is sqrt( (3e5 -700)/(3e5 +700) ) = sqrt(299300/300700) ≈ sqrt(0.99534) ≈ 0.99767.

So T2 = T1 * 0.99767.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 0.99767 ≈ T2 * 1.00233.

So, T1^4 = (T2 * 1.00233)^4 = T2^4 * (1.00233)^4 ≈ T2^4 * 1.00937.

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T2^4 * 1.00937) ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

= (2.25) * 1.00937 ≈ 2.2708.

But none of the options is 2.27. So this case would not match any option.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same, so the velocity's direction must result in the correct T ratio.

Moreover, the problem doesn't specify the direction of the radial velocity, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended approach ignores the Doppler shift, which would lead to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But that would be incorrect because the problem gives the radial velocities. So, the correct approach must include the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler effect when the problem actually refers to the peak emission without considering motion, but the problem states that the observed λ_max are same. So the Doppler effect must be considered.

Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming the stars radiate as black bodies.

Ah, wait a minute. The question says that they computed the luminosity assuming the stars are black bodies. So for that, they would use the radius and effective temperature. So perhaps the observed wavelength is used to compute the effective temperature.

Wait, but that's getting into more confusion. Let me think again.

The observed λ_max is affected by Doppler shift. So if the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual λ_max (before Doppler) would be different.

But when computing the luminosity, you'd use the actual temperature (not the observed), since T is the effective temperature of the star.

But perhaps the problem is that the observed peak wavelength is used to compute T, but considering the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps since the observed λ_max is same, the effective temperature is same, but that can't be right because Doppler shift changes the observed λ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the Doppler shift. Because the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1..." So perhaps the radial velocity isn't needed for the calculation.

Wait, but the question states that the observed λ_max are same, which is affected by radial velocity. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the ratio using R and T, and the Doppler shift is part of that.

Hmm, this is getting really confusing. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. Luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4. So L is proportional to R² T^4.

2. The observed peak wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * Doppler factor.

3. The observed λ_obs for both stars is the same.

4. λ_rest = b / T, so T = b / λ_rest.

So for each star:

T1 = b / λ1_rest.

T2 = b / λ2_rest.

But λ_obs1 = λ1_rest, since Star_1's velocity is zero.

λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

And λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

Which implies:

λ2_rest = λ1_rest / Doppler factor.

Thus, T2 = b / ( λ1_rest / Doppler factor ) ) = (b / λ1_rest) * Doppler factor = T1 * Doppler factor.

Wait, because T1 = b / λ1_rest.

So T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

But Doppler factor depends on the velocity.

If Star_2 is moving away, Doppler factor is greater than 1, so T2 > T1.

If moving towards, Doppler factor is less than 1, T2 < T1.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (T1 * Doppler factor)^4 )

= (2.25 R2²) / R2² * 1/(Doppler factor^4 )

= 2.25 / (Doppler factor^4 )

So what's Doppler factor?

Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) if moving away.

But let's compute it correctly.

Given that λ_obs2 = λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

So,

Doppler factor = λ_obs2 / λ2_rest = λ1_rest / λ2_rest.

But λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

Doppler factor = (b/T1) / (b/T2 ) ) = T2 / T1.

Which brings us back to the earlier conclusion that Doppler factor = T2 / T1.

Wait, that's an interesting point. So:

Doppler factor = T2 / T1.

So from the earlier equation, T2 = T1 * Doppler factor.

Thus, substituting into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (Doppler factor^4 ) = 2.25 / ( (T2/T1)^4 )

But T2 = T1 * Doppler factor => Doppler factor = T2 / T1.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as:

Since Doppler factor is the ratio of observed to rest wavelength, and since observed is same for both, and rest is different.

But perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe I should just compute the Doppler factor from the given velocity and see the impact on T, then compute the luminosity ratio.

Let me proceed with the initial calculation where Star_2 is moving away, which gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But the problem does mention the radial velocities, so I think the Doppler shift must be considered.

Thus, the correct answer would be approximately 2.23, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we start by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is luminosity, \(R\) is radius, \(T\) is effective temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since \(L \propto R^2 T^4\), the ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Radii
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting this into the ratio:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Thus, the radius contribution to the luminosity ratio is 2.25.

### Step 2: Relating Temperatures
The observed peak wavelength (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) at which the stars appear brightest is the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), and accounting for the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1, \(v_1 = 0\), so \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). For Star_2, \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), we find:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\), the Doppler factor is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + 700/300,000}{1 - 700/300,000}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.00233
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Contribution to Luminosity
The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.00233}
\]

Since \(L \propto T^4\), the temperature contribution to the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \left(\frac{1}{1.00233}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 4: Final Luminosity Ratio
Combining the radius and temperature contributions:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 5: Matching the Options
The calculated ratio of \(L_1/L_2 \approx 2.229\) is closest to option **D) ~2.23**.
