Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to the melting point of something familiar. Oh wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I remember that the melting point of ice is 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe it's something like sodium hydroxide? Or perhaps some other solid.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let me think. 277 K is 4°C. Wait, what solid is that temperature? Maybe it's B is a solid, but I'm not sure yet. Let me put that aside for a moment.

The gas W is said to have a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That means the molecule is probably something like O2 or N2. Let me think. For O2, each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen's atomic number is 8, and the most common isotope is O-16 with 8 neutrons). So, O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, no, that's for each molecule. Each molecule of O2 has 2 atoms, so combined, 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh wait, but the molecule's total protons and neutrons are equal. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons, so that's 32 each? Wait, no, wait. Each molecule: total protons equal total neutrons. So for O2, each O is 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So 16 each, which are equal. So yes, O2 would fit. Another possibility is N2, since nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in N-14. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that works too. So gas W is either O2 or N2?

Wait, but the reaction is between substance X and liquid Y. What kind of reaction produces O2 or N2? Let me think. Maybe a decomposition reaction. Or perhaps it's a reaction where a compound breaks down into these gases.

Let me think about what X and Y could be. The problem says that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm. So X is probably a compound where one element is a heavier isotope. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Oh, wait, common reagents include things like NaOH, K, Na, etc. But wait, another thought: in organic chemistry, Grignard reagents are very important. Grignard reagents are organometallic compounds like Mg in an organic compound. But wait, substance X is reacting with liquid Y. Let me think more.

Wait, another possibility: potassium or sodium metal. They react with certain liquids. For example, water. Let's see, if X is a metal, like Na, then liquid Y could be water. The reaction would produce gas H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in each molecule. Wait, but H2 has one proton and one neutron per molecule? No, wait. Each H atom has 1 proton and, if it's deuterium, one neutron. So H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, assuming it's D2. But the problem says the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see, H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so that works. So gas W would be H2. Wait, but then, the reaction of sodium with water gives H2 gas. So that could fit.

But earlier possibilities with O2 or N2 were for other reactions. So perhaps this is a different scenario. Let me think again.

Wait, if W is H2, the reaction between X (like Na) and Y (like water) would produce H2. So that's possible. Then, what's precipitate G? When Na reacts with water, it produces NaOH and H2, but sodium is more likely to react vigorously, producing NaOH and H2. But that doesn't form a precipitate. Unless Y is not water but something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Let me think. If X is a metal and Y is an acid, maybe a reaction occurs. Wait, but the product could be a gas. Or perhaps Y is a solution of a salt. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another angle.

The problem also mentions that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid, or something similar. So if a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. That suggests that X is something that might add to the acid, perhaps removing oxygen. Wait, but maybe it's a neutralization reaction.

Wait, another thought. If X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, then the neutralization would produce sodium acetate, which has O in the acetate ion. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the product.

Wait, if X is a base like NaOH and the keto acid is something like RCOOH (a carboxylic acid, which is a keto acid), then the neutralization would produce RCOO^- Na^+ and water. The product would have more oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product is said to have two oxygen atoms. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the product is something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible substances for X. The question says that X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and that a close analog is also used. So maybe X is something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but that's a solvent, not a reagent. Alternatively, maybe X is a Grignard reagent, but Grignards are organometallic and are used in reactions like addition to carbonyls.

Wait, but Grignard reagents are made from haloalkanes and Mg. They react with carbonyl compounds. So if X is a Grignard reagent, then when it reacts with a keto acid (which is a carbonyl-containing acid), perhaps it would add to the carbonyl group. But I'm not sure what product would have two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, if X is a base, like NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid (like a ketone plus acid) might lead to some kind of condensation reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, such as Na. If X is sodium, reacting with water (Y) produces H2 (W), and a precipitate G. But wait, sodium and water reacting would produce NaOH and H2. NaOH is soluble, so that wouldn't form a precipitate. Unless Y is not water. Maybe Y is an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl, but that's probably not it. Wait, but in this case, X is the reagent, so perhaps X is AgNO3. Wait, but AgNO3 in solution reacts with Cl- to form AgCl precipitate. The gas produced would be... maybe not. Wait, but in that case, the gas would be HCl? No, that's a solution. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. For example, if X is HCl (but that's a liquid?), but wait, HCl is a gas. Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate solution, and X is an acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. So B is a solid at that temperature. Let's think about solids that melt around that temperature. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So what solid has a melting point around there? Sodium hydroxide's melting point is higher, about 318°C. Wait, no, that's way higher. Wait, maybe it's not a hydroxide. What about something like ammonium chloride? No, its melting point is around 334 K (61°C), which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe B is water ice? Because 277 K is just a bit above 0°C, which is the melting point of ice. But ice melts at 273 K, so 277 is just a bit higher. But then, why would G, when heated, release B as a solid? Wait, maybe B is a solid that's left after heating. For example, when a carbonate decomposes upon heating, it might produce CO2 and a metal oxide. Wait, but that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. But that would release CO2 gas, which would be W. But earlier, W was thought to be O2 or H2 or N2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid like sodium carbonate or something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal oxide. Let me think. If G is a hydroxide, and upon heating, it dehydrates to form an oxide. For example, heating sodium hydroxide would not change much, but perhaps another hydroxide.

Wait, let's think about the melting point again. 277 K is about 4°C. So what solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? Wait, no, its melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, maybe I should look for a solid that melts at about 277 K. Let me think. Wait, 277 K is approximately 4°C. So, for example, the melting point of water is 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. But that's ice. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid with a higher melting point than ice but lower than, say, 273 K. Hmm, perhaps it's something like ammonium chloride. Wait, no, I think it's 334 K or so.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like sodium acetate trihydrate. Wait, sodium acetate's melting point is around 210°C, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps this line of thinking isn't getting me anywhere. Maybe I should move on and see if other parts of the problem can help.

So, the product of a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think about a keto acid. A keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. If X is a base like NaOH, then the reaction would be a neutralization, producing sodium acetoacetate. The formula would be CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+. The product would have more oxygen atoms than the acid itself, but the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is a strong oxidizing agent. Maybe KMnO4. But I'm not sure. Let me think of a reaction between a keto acid and KMnO4. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and the reaction is displacement. Let's say X is Fe, and the keto acid is something like citric acid. Then the reaction would produce Fe^3+ and the acid would be reduced. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a product with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diatomic molecule with two oxygen atoms. That could be O2, but that's the gas W. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is water (H2O), which has one O atom. But the problem says two atoms. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is an oxide, like CO2 or something. But how would that come from a keto acid and X?

Wait, perhaps X is a base, like NaOH. If the keto acid is something like formic acid (which is a keto acid), then the neutralization would produce sodium formate. Formic acid is HCOOH, so sodium formate is HCOONa. Each formate ion has two oxygen atoms (HCOO^-). So the product would have two oxygen atoms per molecule. Oh, that fits!

So, if X is NaOH, reacting with formic acid (HCOOH) would produce HCOO^- Na^+ and water. The product has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. That fits the description.

So, if X is NaOH, then what happens when it reacts with liquid Y? Let's see, Y would be formic acid. But in the initial reaction, X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and then B upon heating G.

Wait, but formic acid is a liquid. So X (NaOH) is a solid or a liquid? NaOH is a solid, but in solution, it's a liquid. So Y would be formic acid, and X is NaOH. Their reaction would produce sodium formate, water, and perhaps some gas. Wait, but formic acid reacting with NaOH would produce sodium formate and water. No gas is released in that neutralization reaction. So maybe that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different base, like KOH. Or maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: If X is sodium metal (Na), and Y is a solution of a salt, perhaps something like a nitrate. When sodium reacts with a nitrate solution, it might produce sodium nitrate, hydrogen gas, and perhaps some other products. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate solution, like sodium carbonate. Then, X could be a metal like calcium. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the problem, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. Then, when G is heated, it releases B. So, perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. Then, B might be the metal oxide, which has a melting point around 277 K. Hmm, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that dehydrates upon heating. For example, heating sodium hydroxide wouldn't do much, but maybe another hydroxide. For example, some metal hydroxides lose water upon heating to form an oxide. So, if G is a hydroxide, heating it would produce B as an oxide, and perhaps some water vapor. But I'm not sure about the melting point of B.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the isotopes. The problem states that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has one element with a heavier isotope. For example, if X is NaOH, the oxygen is usually O-16, but perhaps it has some O-18. Or maybe the hydrogen is deuterium. But heavier isotopes are less common, so maybe X is something like D2O, but that's more of a heavy water thing.

Wait, but the question says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes. For example, let's say X has elements A and B. The lightest isotope of A is A_min, and the heaviest is A_max. Similarly for B. Then, the sum would be (A_min + A_max) + (B_min + B_max). But wait, no, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the lightest and heaviest elements in X, summing their atomic masses? Or for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes, then sum all those together?

Hmm. Let's re-read that part: "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. For example, if X has elements like Na and O, the lightest element is O (atomic number 8), and the heaviest is Na (atomic number 11). So the sum would be 16 (O) + 23 (Na) = 39. But none of the options match that. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps for each element in X, we take the lightest and heaviest isotopes. For example, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. For Na, the lightest isotope is Na-23 (23), and the heaviest is Na-25 (25). For O, lightest is O-16 (16), and heaviest is O-18 (18). For H, lightest is H-1 (1), heaviest is H-2 (2). So the sum for each element would be (23+25) for Na (48), (16+18) for O (34), and (1+2) for H (3). Then, adding all together: 48 +34 +3 = 85. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Like, for X, the lightest element is, say, O, and the heaviest is Na. So their atomic masses are 16 (O) and 23 (Na). Sum is 39. Again, not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about possible X candidates again.

Earlier, I thought about X being NaOH. But the product with a keto acid (formic acid) would produce sodium formate, which has two oxygen atoms. So that fits. But then the reaction of X (NaOH) with Y (maybe water?) but that doesn't produce a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another solution.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3 (ammonia), but that's a gas, not a solid. Or maybe X is something like ethanol, but that doesn't fit with the reaction producing a gas.

Wait, another thought: X is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Reacting with Y, which could be a solution of a metal. Wait, no, perhaps Y is a strong acid, like HCl. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas, NaCl, and water. But that's a possible reaction.

But let's go back. The reaction of X with Y produces gas W. If W is CO2, then the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule must be equal. Let's check: CO2 has 2 C atoms each with 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if C-12), and two O atoms with 8 each. So CO2 has (6*2) = 12 protons, and (6*2 + 8*2) = 20 neutrons. Wait, 12 protons and 20 neutrons. Not equal. So that wouldn't fit.

If W is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's protium, but deuterium has one neutron). So H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So 2 each, which matches the condition. So W is H2.

So if X is a metal, like Na, and Y is water, the reaction would produce NaOH, H2, and precipitate? But NaOH is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm. Unless Y is not water. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol, but that might not explain the precipitate.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Reacting with an acid Y (like HCl), would produce CO2 gas, NaCl, and water. The precipitate G might form if any insoluble product is formed, but in this case, all products are soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. For example, if X is a metal hydroxide, like NaOH, reacting with H2S might produce a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a salt solution. For example, if Y is a solution of a less active metal's salt, and X is a more active metal. Then, X would displace the other metal, producing a precipitate. But then, what gas would be released?

Wait, perhaps X is Mg metal, Y is cold water. Mg reacts with cold water slowly, producing Mg(OH)2 and H2. Mg(OH)2 is a precipitate. Then, when heated, the precipitate might decompose, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let me think about Mg. Mg reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 (which is a precipitate) and H2 gas. So W is H2. Then, precipitate G is Mg(OH)2. When heated, Mg(OH)2 decomposes into MgO and H2O. So B would be MgO. But what's the melting point of MgO? MgO has a very high melting point, around 2800°C, so that's way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Let me try another angle. The product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is a molecule with two O atoms. For example, if X is a base like NaOH, and the keto acid is formaldehyde (but that's not an acid). Alternatively, maybe the product is something like H2O, but that has one O. Or O2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonate, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another thought. If X is a metal, and the keto acid is something like oxalic acid (which has two carboxylic groups), then maybe the reaction would produce a metal oxalate. Oxalic acid is H2C2O4. When neutralized with NaOH, it would produce Na2C2O4 and water. The product (Na2C2O4) has four oxygen atoms. Hmm, but the problem says two.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. For example, if X is a metal and the keto acid is something that would produce an oxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options provided. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of these.

Earlier, for X being NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). So the lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3. But then, the elements are N and H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is N (14). Sum is 15. Not an option.

Alternatively, X is CH3CH2OH (ethanol). Elements are C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12). Sum is 13. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). Then elements are C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum is 13. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule, like O2. But that's not a compound. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like MgO. But MgO is a solid, but in reaction with Y (like water), it would produce Mg(OH)2 and O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide. For example, FeO. Reacting with Y (like an acid) to produce Fe^3+ and water. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is a chloroalkane, reacting with a base to form a Grignard reagent. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the problem.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let's think about the fact that gas W has same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. So possible gases are H2, O2, N2, etc. Let's think about each case.

Case 1: W is H2. So the reaction produces H2. So X and Y react to produce H2. What reactions produce H2? Metal and acid reactions, or metal and water. Let's say X is Na, Y is water. Reaction: 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So gas W is H2. The precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble in water, so that doesn't form a precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless Y is not water.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal carbonate. Suppose X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. Reaction: Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. So the gas is CO2, which doesn't fit because CO2 doesn't have equal protons and neutrons. So that's not the case.

Case 2: W is O2. So what reaction would produce O2? Decomposition reactions, such as the thermal decomposition of a compound. For example, heating KClO3 produces O2. But that doesn't fit with X and Y reacting.

Alternatively, maybe X is a chlorate, and Y is a solution with MnO2 as a catalyst. But I'm not sure.

Case 3: W is N2. How to produce N2? Decomposition of a compound containing N, like ammonium compounds. For example, NH4Cl heated with a strong base might produce NH3 and HCl, but that's not N2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a nitride and water. For example, Ca3N2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + NH3. But that produces NH3, not N2.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the problem again.

So, the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think about what reaction would lead to that. Maybe it's a dehydration reaction, or perhaps a condensation.

Wait, another thought: if X is a dehydrating agent, like P2O5 or something. Then, when it reacts with a keto acid, it might dehydrate it, producing a molecule with fewer oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that reacts with the keto acid to form a salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is HCOOH (formic acid), and X is NaOH, the product is NaHCOO, which has two oxygen atoms (HCOO^-). So that fits.

So, if X is NaOH, the reaction with formic acid (Y) produces NaHCOO and water. So W would be H2O, but that's a liquid. Wait, no, the reaction between NaOH and formic acid would not produce a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. Then, X could be something else. I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about the melting point of B again. It's close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. So what solid has a melting point around there? Wait, could it be ammonium chloride? Wait, no, its melting point is higher. What about sodium carbonate decahydrate? Its melting point is around 277 K? Maybe. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, maybe B is sodium nitrate. Sodium nitrate's melting point is around 327°C, which is way higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point of about 277 K? Let me think. Sodium acetate's anhydrous form has a melting point of about 324°C, but the trihydrate has a lower melting point. I think it's around 277 K, which is 4°C. So if G is sodium acetate trihydrate, heating it would cause it to lose water and form anhydrous sodium acetate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then what would G be before heating? If G is sodium acetate trihydrate, then when heated, it would dehydrate to form anhydrous sodium acetate and water. So B would be the anhydrous sodium acetate, which has a higher melting point. But I thought the melting point of B was around 277 K. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps B is the product of G upon heating, which is a solid with a melting point close to 277 K. So if G is a hydrate, heating it would produce a solid with a higher melting point. Hmm.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Let me try to think of the cumulative atomic masses again.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). Summing 1 + 23 gives 24. Not an option. So that can't be right.

Another possibility: X is Na2CO3. Elements are Na, C, O. Lightest is C (12?), no, wait, H is lighter. Wait, in Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. So the lightest element is C (6?), no, wait, no. Wait, the elements are Na (11), C (6), O (8). So the lightest is C (6), the heaviest is Na (11). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3. Elements N and H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is N (14). Sum 15. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is CH3CH2OH (ethanol). Elements are C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X has elements A and B, where A is lighter and B is heavier, sum their atomic masses.

Looking at the options: 31, 25, etc.

Wait, 31 could be 15 + 16? No. Wait, 31 is the atomic mass of Ar (39.95?), but that might not fit. Alternatively, 15 + 16 is 31? No, 15 is P, 16 is S. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought. If X is something like NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), which is used as a fertilizer. Its elements are N and O. The lightest is N (14), the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 30, which is close to option C (31). But maybe considering isotopes.

Wait, but the question says to consider the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all their isotopes.

Wait, for N, the lightest isotope is N-14 (14), heaviest is N-15 (15). For O, lightest is O-16 (16), heaviest is O-18 (18). So for NH4NO3, the elements are N and O. So sum would be (14 +15) for N, and (16 +18) for O. Total is (29) + (34) = 63. Not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic element, like O2 or N2. But that doesn't make sense in the context of the reaction.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the product of a keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is H2O2. Then H2O2 has two oxygen atoms. So if X reacts with a keto acid to produce H2O2, which has two O atoms. Then, X would be something that provides the necessary elements. For example, if X is H2O2 itself, but that's not a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with a keto acid. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another thought: if the product is CO2, but that has two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is something that reacts with a keto acid to produce CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound. For example, if X is a reducing agent, like NaBH4, and the keto acid is something that can be reduced. But that's a stretch.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me try to outline what I know:

- X reacts with Y to produce gas W (same protons and neutrons), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B (melting point ~277 K).

- X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are NaOH, Na, Mg (Grignard reagents), etc.

- The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms.

So, let's think about Grignard reagents. Grignard reagents are RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. They react with carbonyl compounds. So if X is a Grignard reagent, and the keto acid has a carbonyl group, the reaction would add the R group to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol.

Wait, but the product would have more oxygen atoms than the acid. So if the acid has two O (like HCOOH), the product would have more. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a strong base like NaOH, and the reaction with a keto acid produces a salt with two O atoms. For example, HCOOH (formic acid) reacts with NaOH to produce NaHCOO and water. HCOO^- has two O atoms. So that fits the condition.

So, if X is NaOH, Y is formic acid.

Then, the reaction between NaOH and formic acid (Y) would produce sodium formate (HCOONa) and water. No gas is produced, so gas W must be something else. Hmm, but the problem says that X reacts with Y to produce W.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, and X is a metal. For example, X is Na, Y is Na2CO3. Then, the reaction would be 2 Na + Na2CO3 → 3 Na2↑? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps X is Na and Y is water. Then the reaction produces NaOH and H2. So W is H2. The precipitate is NaOH, but NaOH is soluble. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, X is a metal like Ca. The reaction would be Ca + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 precipitate + 2 Na. But that doesn't produce a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate. X is Mg, Y is Mg(NO3)2. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the precipitate G. If G is a carbonate, perhaps upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. Then, the metal oxide B would have a melting point around 277 K. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfate. Heating it might release SO3 gas or something. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: The melting point of B is 277 K. Let me check the melting points of some compounds. For example, sodium chloride melts at about 801°C, which is much higher. Sodium hydroxide melts at around 318°C. Hmm. What about something like ammonium nitrate? Its melting point is about 169°C. Still higher.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a hydrate that melts at 277 K. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 277 K. So if G is sodium acetate trihydrate, heating it would produce anhydrous sodium acetate and water. But then, what would G be before heating? Perhaps G is a different compound.

Alternatively, if G is sodium carbonate decahydrate, it has a melting point close to 277 K. So when heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous sodium carbonate, which has a higher melting point.

Wait, but then B would be the anhydrous sodium carbonate, which has a higher melting point. Hmm, but the problem states that B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is lower than the decahydrate's. So maybe B is the decahydrate.

Wait, no, because heating would remove water, making the melting point higher. So perhaps B is the product after heating, which has a higher melting point. But the problem says B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is lower than the decahydrate. So maybe I'm getting it backwards.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think of something else. Maybe B is a solid with a low melting point, like ammonium chloride. But earlier I thought its melting point is higher.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Its melting point is around 270°C, which is higher than 277 K (which is about 4°C). No, that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck on identifying B. Let me try to think of other possibilities.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K. So when G is heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous, which has a higher melting point. Then, B would be the anhydrous Na2CO3, which has a higher melting point. But the problem says B's melting point is close to 277 K, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is an anhydrous compound that upon heating forms a hydrate. But that seems unlikely.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Let me try to think of the possible candidates for X based on the options given.

The options for the cumulative atomic masses are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Let me think of elements whose lightest and heaviest sum to one of these.

For example:

- If X has elements with atomic masses adding to 25, perhaps 12 (C) +13 (Al? No, Al is 13). Wait, C is 12, O is 16. 12+16=28. Not 25.

Wait, another approach: for each option, think of possible elements.

Option D) 29.

Possible combinations: 14 (N) +15 (O)=29. Hmm, 14+15=29? No, 14+15=29? No, 14+15=29? Wait, 14+15 is 29. So N (14) and O (16). Wait, no, 14+16 is 30. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 29 could be 15 (P) and 14 (N), but 15+14=29. So maybe X has P and N as elements. So, for example, a compound like NH4PO4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NO. But NO is a gas.

Wait, perhaps X is NH3. Then, the elements are N and H. N is 14, H is 1. Sum is 15, not matching any options.

Option C) 31.

Possible combinations: 16 (O) +15 (P)=31. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl)=31. Or C (12) + O (16)=28, no. Hmm.

Option B) 25.

Possible combinations: 13 (Al) +12 (C)=25. Or O (16) + F (19)=35, which is option A.

Option A) 35.

Possible combinations: 17 (Cl) +18 (Ar)=35. Or O (16) +19 (F)=35.

Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps one element is a heavier isotope, like Cl-35 instead of Cl-35 is the heavier, but Cl usually has 35 and 37 as isotopes.

Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X has, for example, Cl-37. So if X is Cl-based, like Cl2, but that's probably not a reagent.

Alternatively, if X is NaOH, which has H and O. O usually has O-16, but perhaps X has O-18, making it heavier.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C) 31.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that X is a compound like NaHCO3, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, given its reactions and properties. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and eventually solid B upon heating G.  
   - Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons in its molecule, suggesting it could be H₂, O₂, or N₂.  
   - Precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C).  

2. **Melting Point of B**:  
   - The melting point of 277 K (~4°C) suggests B could be a hydrate or a low-melting solid. Sodium acetate trihydrate, for example, has a melting point around this temperature.  

3. **Product with Keto Acid**:  
   - The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X could be a base like NaOH, which reacts with a keto acid (e.g., formic acid) to form sodium formate (HCOONa), where the formate ion (HCOO⁻) contains 2 oxygen atoms.  

4. **Isotopes in X**:  
   - X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. For example, if X is NaOH, the oxygen could be a heavier isotope like O-18 instead of the lighter O-16.  

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**:  
   - The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.  
   - If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), and H (1). The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (23). Their sum is 24, which does not match the options.  
   - Considering other possibilities, if X contains elements like N (14) and O (16), their sum is 30, which is close to option C (31).  

6. **Final Answer**:  
   Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are most consistent with option C (31).
