Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity—right, that's the method where you look for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical in mass, planets are same mass. Got it.

They detected each planet using the RV method. The first planet caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and the second caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but wait—wait, or is it the other way around? No, the question says planet #1's shift is 5, and planet #2's is 7. So the second star's spectral line shifts more.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, if planet #2's period is longer, the ratio would be more than 1. Or maybe not? Because the shift depends on the mass and the orbital period in some way.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is given by a formula. Let me think. The formula for K (the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity) is something like K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ), but I might be mixing it up. Or maybe it's better to recall the simplified version when M_p is much less than M_star, which it is here since the planet is Neptune-like and star is Sun-like.

In that case, the formula simplifies. I think it's K = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (some exponent))... Wait, maybe it's better to think about the formula as derived from the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, the inclination of the orbit (but since both are circular and I think the inclination is the same for both, or at least not given to vary, so maybe it's the same), and the mass of the star.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets' masses are similar to Neptune's, so same. So M_p is same for both. So why are the shifts different? Because the orbital periods are different.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity wobble. The semi-amplitude K (the maximum velocity) depends on several factors. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, from what I remember, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ). Because when you have the same M_p and same M_star, K should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, let me think again. RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler version. Alternatively, I remember that when the planet is much less massive than the star (which it is here), the formula simplifies. So, for a circular orbit (e=0), the formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (G * P) / (2 * pi * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

But wait, I'm probably getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

But I'm not too confident. Alternatively, maybe I should think about how K relates to the orbital period.

Wait, another approach. The RV method's semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (which we can assume is the same for both planets, since we don't have information about that), the mass of the star (same for both), and the orbital period and semi-major axis.

The semi-major axis is related to the period via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) a^3. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, it's approximately P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

So, a ≈ ( (G M_star P²)/(4 π²) )^(1/3)

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) c ) )^(1/ something... wait, maybe I should think about the formula in terms of the velocity.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = ( (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * ( (G / (4 π² c^3))^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) (1 + M_p/(M_star))^(1/3) )

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way. Since both stars are identical, and the planets have the same mass, the difference in K must be due to the orbital period and semi-major axis.

Wait, I remember that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because, looking at the formula, when K increases, the period decreases. So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then their periods would be inversely proportional to K^(3), but wait, I think K is inversely proportional to cube root of P, so P is proportional to (1/K)^3. Or wait, if K is proportional to (something)/ (P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me think about the formula again.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 pi G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) c ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Assuming M_p << M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term can be approximated as 1. So,

K ≈ ( (2 pi G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p)/(M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

Wait, no, because if K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), which would mean P is proportional to 1/(K^3). Because:

K = A / P^(1/3) → P^(1/3) = A / K → P = (A/K)^3 → P ∝ 1/(K^3)

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. If K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3), then:

K ∝ 1 / (P)^(1/3) → P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K → P ∝ (1/K)^3 → P ∝ (1/K³)

So, if K doubles, P becomes 1/(2³) = 1/8. So, P is inversely proportional to K cubed.

Alternatively, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let's see. From the formula, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So,

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

So,

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, but wait, no. Let me re-express the proportionality.

If K1 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) * C, and K2 = (1 / P2^(1/3)) * C → then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So,

(K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but in our case, K2 is larger than K1. Because planet #2 has a shift of 7, which is bigger than planet #1's 5.

So, K2 =7, K1=5. So, K2 > K1 → but according to the formula, P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1. So, P2 is shorter than P1? That can't be, because a larger K would mean a shorter period? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, perhaps I got that reversed. Let me think again. If K is larger, the star is moving more quickly. A more massive planet would cause a larger K. But for the same mass, if K is larger, that would mean a shorter period, because the star has to complete the orbit more quickly to cause a larger shift.

Wait, but let me think about a planet close to the star. It has a shorter period (like Mercury), so the RV signal would have a higher K (since the star is moving faster in its orbit). So, K is higher for a shorter period.

Therefore, if K2 is bigger than K1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So, what's the ratio of P2 to P1? Since P2 is shorter, the ratio would be less than 1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So, if P2 is shorter, the ratio P2/P1 would be less than one, so the answer would be something like 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let's compute it. K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

P2 = (K1 / K2)^3 * P1 → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, the ratio is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, that can't be right—because if K is larger, the period is shorter, so P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So, the answer is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( 1 / P^{1/3} \), meaning that \( P \propto (1/K)^3 \). This implies that the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) is given by:

\[
P_2 / P_1 = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
P_2 / P_1 = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3
\]

Calculating the ratio:

\[
\frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (0.7143)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer: A**
