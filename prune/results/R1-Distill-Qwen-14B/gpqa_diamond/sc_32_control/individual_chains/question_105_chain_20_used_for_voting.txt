Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots that have a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe it over time, the brightness variations will look like those caused by a planet transiting the star. The question is, what radius would a planet need to have to produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Hmm. So, the scenario is that the star's brightness is varying because of these spots, and without the spots, a planet would cause a similar dip in brightness when it transits. We need to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar that would mimic the effect of the spots.

First, I think I need to calculate the total brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, find what planet radius would cause the same dip.

So, the star's radius Rstar is same as the Sun. Let's say Rstar = R_sun. The filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, the hemisphere area is (1/2) * 4πR² = 2πR². So spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So spots cover 20% of that hemisphere's area. So the area is 0.2 * (2πR²) ? Because the hemisphere's area is 2πR². Wait, the total surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so hemisphere is 2πR². So spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K, which is 5000 K.

The star's brightness is due to its blackbody emission. The total flux without any spots would be the star's flux, Fstar = σTeff^4. The total flux when spots are present is the sum of the spot flux and the rest of the star's flux.

Wait, but the star is a blackbody, so each part emits according to its temperature. The unspotted areas are at 6000 K, and the spotted areas are at 5000 K.

So, the total flux when spots are present is: (Area without spots) * σ(6000)^4 + (Area with spots) * σ(5000)^4.

But how does this compare to the total flux without spots? The variation in flux would cause the brightness dip when spots are on the side we see or when they're facing away, depending on the star's rotation.

Wait, but the problem is about the periodic brightness variation due to spots rotating into and out of view. So, when a spot is on the visible hemisphere, it makes the star appear dimmer. The maximum dimming occurs when the spot is fully visible.

But in this case, the star's brightness variation is being compared to a planet transit. So, the dip in brightness (the amplitude) when the planet transits is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but the question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)", so without the spots, a planet would do the same. So we're to find what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots do.

So, the dip caused by the planet is when it blocks part of the star's light. The fractional dip is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) multiplied by the star's flux.

But the dip caused by the spots is a bit more complicated. Let me think.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4π) ) ? Wait, no. The flux from a star is often calculated as the total power emitted per unit area (sigma T^4) multiplied by the surface area. So, the total power is L = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are present, the total power is L = (Area_unspotted * σ T_unspotted^4) + (Area_spotted * σ T_spotted^4).

Area_unspotted is the area of the hemisphere minus the spots. The hemisphere is 2π Rstar², so the unspotted area is 0.8 * 2π Rstar² = 1.6π Rstar². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4π Rstar².

So, L = 1.6π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4π R² σ (5000)^4.

The original luminosity (without spots) is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4. So the ratio is L/L0 = [1.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / (4 * (6000^4)).

Wait, wait. Wait, the total area is 2π R² for the hemisphere, but in reality, the star emits from all sides. Oh wait, no, the star's total surface area is 4π R², but when one hemisphere is spotted, the unspotted hemisphere is 2π R² and the spotted is 2π R² as well. Wait, no: the problem says that one hemisphere is covered. So the unspotted hemisphere is 2π R², the spotted is also 2π R², but 20% of that is covered with spots.

Wait, maybe I need to model the star as having two hemispheres: the front and the back. When we look at the star, we can see the front hemisphere and not the back. So, the front hemisphere (visible to us) has 20% of its area covered by spots, and the back is unspotted.

So, the area of the front hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that (0.2 * 2π R²) = 0.4 π R² is spots, the rest (1.6 π R²) is unspotted.

So the total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is the sum of the unspotted part (1.6 π R²) at 6000 K and the spotted part (0.4 π R²) at 5000 K.

The original luminosity (if no spots) would be 4 π R² * sigma * (6000)^4.

So the observed luminosity when spots are on the front is:

L = (1.6 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 pi R²) * sigma (5000)^4

We can factor out pi R² sigma:

L = pi R² sigma [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] 

The original luminosity (without spots) is L0 = 4 pi R² sigma (6000^4).

So the ratio L/L0 is [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / [4*(6000^4)]

Let me calculate that.

First, compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 5^4 *1e12 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So,

1.6 * 6000^4 = 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15

0.4 * 5000^4 = 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14

Adding them: 2.0736e15 + 2.5e14 = 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 = 2.3236e15.

The denominator is 4 * 6000^4 = 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So L/L0 = (2.3236e15) / (5.184e15) = approximately 0.4473.

So the brightness is about 44.73% of the original when the spots are visible. Wait, that can't be right because 44% would mean a big dip, but I'm probably making a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Because when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the star appears dimmer. So the brightness when spots are visible is lower than L0.

Wait, but the ratio L/L0 is 0.4473, which would imply that the star emits 44.73% of its normal brightness when the spots are visible. So the dip is 100% - 44.73% = 55.27%.

Wait, that's a big dip. But that can't be the case because even with spots covering 20% of the hemisphere, the temperature difference is smaller. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 6000^4 is (6000)^4 = 6000 * 6000 * 6000 * 6000 = 6^4 * 1e3^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 is 5^4 *1e3^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 1.6 * 6e3^4 = 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 *5e3^4 = 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 0.25e15 = 2.5e14.

So 2.0736e15 + 2.5e14 = 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 = 2.3236e15.

Denominator: 4 *1.296e15 =5.184e15.

So 2.3236e15 /5.184e15 = approximately 0.4473.

So L = 0.4473 L0.

Wait, that would mean that when the spots are on the visible side, the star appears 44.73% as bright as usual. So the dip is 55.27% of the original brightness.

Wait, but that's a huge dip. Even a planet with radius 0.3 Rstar would block (0.3)^2 = 9% of the light. But here the dip is 55%—that's much bigger. So perhaps the way I'm modeling it is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the spots are on only part of the star that's rotating into view, so the maximum dip is when the maximum area is blocked. Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation—so the spots rotate into view and out of view, causing a periodic change.

But the question is, how does this compare to a planet transit. The planet would cause a dip equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 when it transits in front.

So, when the spots are on the side we can see, the brightness is lower. The maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the dip is (L0 - L_spotted)/L0.

Wait, but in the calculation, that dip is (1 - 0.4473) = 0.5527, so 55.27% dip. That's a lot.

So the planet would need to block 55% of the light when it transits, which would require a very large planet. But that can't be the case because Jupiter would cause about a 1% dip. Wait, wait, no: Jupiter's radius is about 10% of the Sun's radius. So Rpl/Rstar is 0.1, which would cause a (0.1)^2 = 1% dip.

Wait, but here the dip is 55%, which is way larger. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, the problem says that the star is observed to have brightness variations due to the spots, and those variations are as if an exoplanet were transiting. So when the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases, and when they rotate away, it increases. The amplitude of this variation is the same as a planet transit.

So the dip caused by the spots is the same as the dip caused by a planet. We need to find Rpl such that the dip is the same.

Wait, so the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The dip caused by the spots is the fractional change in brightness when the spots are on the visible side. So what is that dip?

Wait, perhaps the dip is (fractional loss of flux) = [ (Area_spotted * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 )) / (Total area) * (something) ].

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the difference in flux between when the spots are on the visible side and when they're not.

Wait, when the spots are on the far side, we don't see them, so the star's brightness is at maximum—L0.

When the spots are on the near side, the brightness is L_spotted, which is less than L0.

The dip is (L0 - L_spotted)/L0.

So, let's compute that.

L_spotted is as calculated before: 0.4473 L0.

So dip = (1 - 0.4473) = 0.5527, or 55.27%.

So the dip is 55.27% of the star's brightness.

That's the dip amplitude when the spots are on the near side.

So the planet's dip when it transits is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So we need (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.5527.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply Rpl is sqrt(0.5527)*Rstar ≈ 0.74 Rstar, which is larger than Jupiter, which is impossible because Jupiter is about 0.1 Rstar.

Wait, but that can't be. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I have the approach wrong. Maybe the dip caused by the spots is not 55%, but much smaller.

Wait, perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The total variation would be the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, but the star's brightness without spots is L0. When the spots are on the front, the brightness is L_spotted. When the spots are on the back, the brightness is L0.

Wait, but no, that's not correct because when the spots are on the back, we don't see them. So the brightness is L0. When the spots are on the front, brightness is L_spotted. So the maximum brightness is L0, and the minimum is L_spotted.

So the maximum change in brightness is (L0 - L_spotted) = 55.27% of L0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 55.27% of L0.

But the planet transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * L0.

So setting (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * L0 = (L0 - L_spotted) = 0.5527 L0.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.5527 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.5527) ≈ 0.743.

But that's a planet larger than the host star, which is impossible because planets can't be larger than their host stars. So clearly, I have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the total brightness with the brightness variation. Because when the spots rotate, the brightness changes in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps the dip is not 55%, but a smaller value. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the star emits more when the spots are not visible. Wait, no, the star's total luminosity is the same regardless of where the spots are, because spots are just cooler regions. Hmm, no, the star's total luminosity is fixed, but the observed flux depends on which parts are visible.

Wait, the star's total luminosity is the same as before, but when the spots are facing us, the observed flux is lower. So the dip is the difference between the flux when spots are not visible (maximum flux) and when they are visible (minimum flux).

Wait, but I think I got that right. So the dip is 55% of the star's flux.

But that's impossible for a planet transit because the planet can't block 55% of the star's light.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So perhaps the brightness variation is similar in shape to that of a planet transit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total change in flux is the same as the planet would cause. So the maximum dip is the same.

So, the dip caused by the spots is (L0 - L_spotted) = 0.5527 L0.

The dip caused by the planet is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) L0.

So to have the same dip amplitude:

(Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) L0 = 0.5527 L0 → Rpl^2 / Rstar^2 = 0.5527 → Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.5527) ≈ Rstar * 0.743.

But that's impossible because Rpl can't be larger than Rstar. So I must have a mistake in the way I calculated the dip.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's brightness when spots are present and when they're not. Let me think again.

The star's total luminosity when spots are on the near side is L1, and when they're on the far side, it's L0.

Wait, no, the star's total luminosity is always the same. The spots are just cooler regions, so when they're on the near side, the observed brightness is less.

Wait, no, the star's total luminosity is still the same as before. The spots are part of the star's surface, so the total luminosity doesn't change. But the observed flux from the star does, based on which parts are visible.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between total luminosity and the observed flux. The star's total luminosity is 4π R² σ Teff^4. When we observe the star, the flux we receive depends on the area of the star that is visible and the temperature of those regions.

So when a spot is on the near side, the area A_spot (which is cooler) is part of the observed area, so the flux is:

F = (A_unspotted * T_unspotted^4 + A_spotted * T_spotted^4) / (4π R²) × 4π R² ... wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the observed flux from the star is the integral of the flux from each point on the star's surface. So, for a distant observer, the flux from a small area dA at a temperature T is (T^4 / (π D^2)) * dA, assuming the star is at distance D and the area is dA on the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: The star's surface has two regions, unspotted and spotted. The total flux observed is the sum of the flux from each region.

The flux from a region is σ T^4 multiplied by the area of that region as seen by the observer. For a distant observer, the area seen is π R² (since the star is a sphere, the cross-section is a circle of radius R) times the fraction of the surface covered by each region.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me model the star as a sphere. The observer sees the star's surface as a disk of area π R². The fraction of that disk covered by spots depends on the rotation. But in this problem, it's a static spot coverage on a hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness when the spots are on the near side is such that the spots cover a certain fraction of the disk. Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered with spots, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the front, otherwise on the back.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I thought. The filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. But the hemisphere's area is 2π R², so the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4 π R². So, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1 or 10%. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so when we look at it, only a hemisphere is visible. So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the visible area is π R² (the cross-section), so the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4. So 40% of the visible area is spots when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the hemisphere (front) that's spotted has 20% spot coverage. So the area of spots on the front is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². The visible area is π R² (the area of the circle we see). So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4 or 40%.

Wait, that seems high. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the area we see is spots. So the spots are covering 40% of the visible disk.

So, the total flux when the spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The flux from the unspotted part: (1 - 0.4) * (π R²) * (sigma T_unspotted^4) / (4 pi R^2) )  * 4 pi R^2? Hmm, maybe I should model it differently.

Wait, each point on the star's surface emits flux sigma T^4 per unit area. The observer sees the sum of all points in the visible hemisphere.

So, the flux from the unspotted part is (Area_unspotted) * sigma T_unspotted^4.

Similarly for the spotted part.

The total flux when the spots are visible would be:

F_spotted = [ (0.6 * 2 π R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * sigma (5000)^4 ] / (4 pi R²) ) * 4 pi R² ?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the flux from the star is the sum of the flux from each part.

The star's surface area is 4 pi R². The visible area is pi R² (the hemisphere). So, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the spotted area on the visible side is 0.4 pi R² (as calculated before).

So, the flux from the star is:

F = [ (pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² * sigma (5000)^4 ].

Simplifying, F = [ 0.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4 ].

The normal flux (without any spots) is F0 = pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

So the flux when spots are present is F = sigma pi R² [0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 ].

F0 = sigma pi R² (6000)^4.

So the ratio F/F0 is [0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / (6000^4).

Calculating this:

6000^4 = 1.296e15 (as before)
5000^4 = 6.25e14.

So,

0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14
0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14
Total numerator = 7.776e14 + 2.5e14 = 1.0276e15
Denominator = 1.296e15.

So F/F0 = 1.0276e15 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.792.

So the brightness when spots are present is about 79.2% of the normal brightness. So the dip is 100% - 79.2% = 20.8%.

Wait, that's much more reasonable. So the dip is about 20.8%.

So, the planet would cause the same dip. So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.208 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.208) ≈ 0.456.

Wait, but that's about 0.46 Rstar, which is bigger than Jupiter (which is about 0.1 Rstar). But looking at the options, option A is ~0.39, and option D is ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

So, F/F0 when spots are present is [0.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4] / 6000^4.

Compute each term:

0.6 * 6000^4 = 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

0.4 *5000^4 = 0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Total numerator: 7.776e14 + 2.5e14 = 1.0276e15.

Denominator: 6000^4 = 1.296e15.

So F/F0 = 1.0276e15 / 1.296e15 = approximately 0.792.

So dip is 1 - 0.792 = 0.208, or 20.8%.

So, dip amplitude is 20.8% of the star's brightness.

So, the planet's dip would have to be 20.8%, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.208.

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.208) ≈ 0.456.

But none of the options are around 0.46. The closest option is A) ~0.39, which is (0.39)^2 = 0.152, which is about 15% dip. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area. Let me think again.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of the spots on the hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere's area. The hemisphere's area is 2 pi R². So the spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

But the visible area when the hemisphere is facing us is the cross-section, which is pi R². So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (pi R²) ) = 0.4 → 40% of the visible area is spots.

So, the area of the spots in the visible hemisphere is 40% of the disk area. So, the area is 0.4 * pi R².

Wait, but earlier I used 0.4 pi R² as the area of the spots, but in the calculation, I used F = [0.6 * pi R² * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * pi R² * (5000)^4 ].

Wait, but this approach is incorrect because the unspotted part is 60% of the visible hemisphere, which is 0.6 pi R², and the spotted is 0.4 pi R².

So, the total flux is:

F = (0.6 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 pi R²) * sigma (5000)^4.

The normal flux is F0 = pi R² * sigma (6000)^4.

So F/F0 = [0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4] / 6000^4 = 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 = 0.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4.

Compute (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So F/F0 = 0.6 + 0.4 * 0.48225 = 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929 → approximately 0.793.

So dip is 1 - 0.793 = 0.207, or 20.7% dip.

So the planet's dip is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) = 0.207 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.454.

But none of the options match this. The options are:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2=0.152 → 15.2% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Hmm, so none of these match 20.7% dip. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I model the star's brightness variation.

Wait, another approach: The star's brightness variation is periodic because the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of the variation is the difference between when the spots are on the visible side and when they're not.

So, when the spots are on the far side (not visible), the star's brightness is F0.

When the spots are on the near side (visible), the brightness is F_spotted.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted).

Earlier, I calculated F_spotted as 0.793 F0. So the amplitude is 0.207 F0.

So the dip is 0.207 F0.

So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 F0.

So, set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.207 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.454.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I have to reevaluate the setup.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature includes the spots. No, the effective temperature is given as 6000 K, which is the overall temperature. The spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

So, the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spotted area on the visible hemisphere is 0.4 pi R², which is 40% of the visible area (pi R²).

So, the flux when the spots are visible is F = 0.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4) multiplied by sigma pi R².

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is not facing us, the spots are on the far side, so the flux is just F0 = sigma pi R² (6000^4).

So the brightness variation is between F0 and F when the spots are visible.

So, F when spots are visible is:

F = (0.6 * pi R² * sigma (6000^4)) + (0.4 pi R² sigma (5000^4)).

Divide F by F0 (which is pi R² sigma (6000^4)):

F/F0 = [0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / 6000^4.

Which is 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4.

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So F/F0 = 0.6 + 0.4 * 0.48225 = 0.6 + 0.1929 ≈ 0.7929.

So, the dip is 1 - 0.7929 = 0.2071, which is about 20.7% dip.

So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl = 0.454 Rstar.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm miscalculating again.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering that the star's total flux when spots are present is the same as when they're not, but the observed flux changes. Hmm, no, the star's total flux is the same. The observed flux depends on which parts are visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is meant to calculate the relative brightness variation, not the absolute dip.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is the peak-to-peak change, but when the spots rotate, the star's brightness varies between F0 and F_spotted. So the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted) = 0.207 F0.

So, the planet would need to cause a dip of 0.207 F0, which corresponds to a (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.207 → Rpl/Rstar = 0.454. But this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness as being modulated by the spots, but when the star isn't spotted, the planet's transit would cause a dip. So, the question is, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the brightness variation as the spots do.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the brightness variation caused by the spots as a function of the rotation period, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is at maximum, and when on the near side, it's at minimum. So the amplitude is (F_visible_spots - F_invisible_spots).

But wait, when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is F0, and when on the near side, it's F_spotted. So the amplitude is F0 - F_spotted = 0.207 F0.

Wait, but for a planet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 F0. So setting (Rpl/Rstar)^2 F0 = 0.207 F0 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.454, which is not an option.

So perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe the problem is considering the change in brightness when the star rotates, but the spots are only on a part of the star, leading to a varying brightness as they come into view.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the change in brightness over time due to spots rotating in and out of view, and the amplitude of that change is the same as the planet's dip.

Wait, but the dip caused by the planet is a one-time event during transit, while the spots cause a periodic variation. However, the amplitude of the variation would be the same as the planet's dip.

So perhaps I need to model the brightness variation when the spots are on the limb versus the center, leading to a varying brightness change as the spots rotate. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total change in brightness over the entire rotation period. That is, the maximum change from when all the spots are on the near side to when they're on the far side.

Wait, but I thought that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The spots cause a brightness dip of a certain amount, and the planet must cause the same dip.

But perhaps I should compute the dip differently. Let me think again.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ), but since we're considering relative brightness, D cancels out.

When the spots are present, the flux is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) * (Teff^4) + f * (Teff - delta T)^4 ] / Teff^4, where f is the filling factor on the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but in our case, the filling factor on the visible hemisphere is 0.4 (40% of the hemisphere's area). So f = 0.4.

So F = F0 * [ (1 - 0.4) * Teff^4 + 0.4 (Teff - 1000)^4 ] / Teff^4.

Compute this:

(1 - 0.4) = 0.6 → 0.6 * Teff^4.

0.4 * (Teff -1000)^4.

So F = F0 * [0.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ] / Teff^4.

Which is F = F0 [0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 ].

As before, (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So F = F0 [0.6 + 0.4*0.48225] = F0 [0.6 + 0.1929] = F0 * 0.7929.

So the dip is 1 - 0.7929 = 0.2071 → 20.71% of F0.

So the planet's dip must be 0.2071 F0, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.454.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is the same as the planet's transit, but the planet's transit is a one-time dip, while the spots cause a dip that varies as the star rotates. But the amplitude of the dip is the same as the planet's.

But earlier calculations don't match the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but the planet's radius is to be found relative to the host star's radius. So Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, in the problem statement, the star's radius is same as the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The planet's radius is to be found as a fraction of Rstar.

So, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of F/F0.

Wait, 0.6 * (6000^4) is 7.776e14.

0.4 * (5000^4) is 2.5e14.

Sum is 1.0276e15.

Divided by 1.296e15 → 0.792.

So F/F0 = 0.792 → dip of 0.208.

So Rpl = sqrt(0.208) Rstar ≈ 0.456 Rstar.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation when the spot is on the limb versus the center, leading to a varying dip, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: Maybe I'm supposed to compute the equivalent of the planet as the area of the spots. But the spots' area is 0.4 pi R², which is 40% of the visible area. So the area of the spots is 0.4 pi R². The area blocked by a planet is pi (Rpl)^2. So to get the same dip, pi Rpl^2 = 0.4 pi R² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R. But that's a larger planet than the options suggest.

Hmm, but in that case, the dip would be (0.4 pi R²)/(pi R²) )= 0.4 → 40% dip, which is much higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the planet that would cause the same signal as the spots, but considering the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the planet's area as a fraction of the star's area, which would be the same as the spots' area as a fraction of the star's area.

But the spots cover 0.4 pi R² on the visible hemisphere, but the star's total area is 4 pi R². So the fraction is (0.4 pi R²)/(4 pi R²) ) = 0.1 → 10%. So the planet's area should be 10% of the star's area. So (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) = 0.1 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is about 0.32, matching option D.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested a dip of 20.7%, which would require Rpl/Rstar ≈0.454. But this approach gives Rpl/Rstar ≈0.32.

So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the planet's radius such that the area blocked is the same as the area of the spots. Because the spots cover 0.4 pi Rstar², and the planet's area is pi Rpl², so set pi Rpl² = 0.4 pi Rstar² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) Rstar ≈ 0.632 Rstar. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots on the star's surface as a fraction of the star's total area. The spots cover 0.4 pi R² on the hemisphere, which is 2 pi R² total. So the fraction is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1 → 10%. So the planet's area should be 10% of the star's, so Rpl = sqrt(0.1) Rstar ≈ 0.316 Rstar → option D is ~0.32.

But earlier calculation with flux gave a higher Rpl. So perhaps the correct approach is this: the area of the spots is 10% of the star's total area.

Wait, but the star's surface area is 4 pi R². The spots cover 0.4 pi R² (from 20% of the hemisphere's area: 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R²).

So fraction = 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1 → 10%.

If the planet's area is 10% of the star's area, then (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is option D.

But earlier, the dip in brightness was calculated as 20.7%, which would require a larger planet. So why would the two approaches give different answers?

Ah, because the dip in brightness is determined by the change in flux due to the spots, which depends on their temperature, not just their area. So the dip isn't just proportional to the area, but to the area times the difference in temperature to the fourth power.

So, the correct approach is the flux-based calculation, which gives Rpl/Rstar ≈0.454, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest to 0.454 is option A: ~0.39, but that's still quite a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the F/F0 ratio.

Let me recalculate:

(5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So F/F0 = 0.6 + 0.4 * 0.48225 = 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929.

So dip is 1 - 0.7929 = 0.2071 → 20.71% dip.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

Hmm.

But looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem states that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, i.e., 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So on the visible hemisphere when the spots are facing us, 20% of that area is spots.

Wait, perhaps the hemisphere in question is the near side, so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The visible area is pi R², so the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4 → 40%.

So, the flux when the spots are visible is F = 0.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4), scaled by sigma pi R².

Flux when spots not visible is F0 = 6000^4 * sigma pi R².

So ratio F/F0 = [0.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 (5000^4)] / (6000^4) = 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 = 0.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4.

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So F/F0 = 0.6 + 0.4*0.48225 = 0.7929.

Thus, the dip is 0.2071. So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem intended to have the same brightness variation but in the opposite way—when the spots are not visible, the brightness is higher. Wait, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's flux when the spots are on the far side, which is F0, and when on the near side, it's lower. So the difference is F0 - F_spotted = 0.2071 F0.

So, the dip is 0.2071 F0.

So, the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view only partially, leading to a smaller dip than when the entire hemisphere is visible. Wait, but the problem states that one hemisphere is spotty, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire spot area is visible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is not a simple dip, but a sinusoidal variation, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. But I'm not sure how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation when the spots are only partially visible, leading to a smaller dip.

Wait, another approach: The total area of the spots is 0.4 pi R². The area of the planet would need to be the same, so pi Rpl² = 0.4 pi R² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R. But that's option A is 0.39 and option D is 0.32.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the planet's radius such that the planet's area is the same as the spot area on the star's surface.

The spot area on the star's surface is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The planet's area is pi Rpl².

Set them equal: pi Rpl² = 0.4 pi R² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius to produce the same signal in the light curve as the spots. The signal would be the same as the dip caused by the spots. So, Rpl/Rstar = sqrt( dip ) = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem intended to have the spots' filling factor be 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere. Let me see.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then the area is 0.2 * 4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R².

When the spots are on the visible side (hemisphere), the area visible is 0.8 pi R² * 0.5 = 0.4 pi R². So the fraction of the visible area is 0.4 pi R² / (pi R²) = 0.4 → same as before.

So the F/F0 ratio remains the same. So dip is 20.7%, leading to Rpl/Rstar=0.455.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the spot's temperature difference applied differently. Let me recheck the calculation.

The spot's temperature is 5000 K, and the star's is 6000 K.

The flux from a spot is sigma (5000)^4 per unit area, and from the star it's sigma (6000)^4.

The ratio for each area is (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So, when the spot is visible, each unit area emits 0.48225 times as much as the star's normal emission.

So, the total flux when the spot is visible is (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4, where f is the filling factor.

In this case, when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the filling factor f is 0.4 (40% of visible area).

So, F/F0 = (1 - 0.4) * 1 + 0.4 * 0.48225 = 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929 → dip 20.7%.

So again, Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing a key point in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the planet's radius such that the same amount of flux is blocked, but the star's T_eff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, the flux difference per unit area is (6000^4 - 5000^4) * sigma.

The area blocked by the planet is pi Rpl². The area blocked by the spots is 0.4 pi Rstar².

So, the total flux blocked by spots is 0.4 pi Rstar² * sigma (6000^4 -5000^4).

The flux blocked by the planet is pi Rpl² * sigma (6000^4).

Setting them equal: pi Rpl² (6000^4) = 0.4 pi Rstar² (6000^4 -5000^4).

Divide both sides by pi sigma (6000^4):

Rpl² = 0.4 Rstar² (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= 0.4 Rstar² [1 - (5/6)^4 ]

= 0.4 Rstar² [1 - 0.48225 ]

= 0.4 Rstar² * 0.51775 ≈0.4 * 0.51775 Rstar² = 0.2071 Rstar².

So Rpl = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Again, same result.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius such that the transit depth is the same as the brightness variation due to the spots. The transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The brightness variation due to the spots is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = (1 - F_spotted/F0) = 0.2071.

So, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl/Rstar = ~0.455.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach was different.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is to find the planet's radius such that the area covered is the same as the spot's area on the star's surface.

The star's surface area is 4 pi R². The spots cover 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So the fraction is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1 → 10% of the star's surface.

So, to get the same area, the planet's area would be 10% of the star's area. But the planet's area is pi Rpl² = 0.1 * 4 pi R² → Rpl² = 0.4 R² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, the planet's area is 10% of the star's cross-sectional area (pi R²), so pi Rpl² = 0.1 pi R² → Rpl = sqrt(0.1) R ≈ 0.316 R. Which is option D.

But this approach ignores the temperature difference, which affects the brightness variation.

Another possibility: Perhaps the problem is intended to use the fraction of the star's light blocked by the spots, which is the area of the spots times their temperature difference.

So, the fractional change in flux is f * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4.

In this case, f is 0.4 (40% of the visible area), T_spot =5000 K, T_star=6000 K.

So, fractional change = 0.4 * (5000^4 -6000^4)/6000^4.

But (5000/6000)^4 = 0.48225 → 5000^4 = 0.48225 * 6000^4.

So, 5000^4 -6000^4 = - (1-0.48225) *6000^4 = -0.51775 *6000^4.

So fractional change is 0.4 * (-0.51775) → -0.2071 → dip of 20.71%.

So, the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl=0.455 R.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm. At this point, I'm stuck. The calculations consistently point to Rpl/Rstar ≈0.455, but none of the options are close. The closest option is A) ~0.39, but that gives a dip of about (0.39)^2 = 0.152, or 15.2%, which is less than the 20.7% dip from the spots.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of F/F0.

Wait, perhaps the area of the spots on the visible hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The visible area is pi R², so the fraction is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4.

So, F = (0.6 pi R² * sigma 6000^4 ) + (0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 ) .

F0 = pi R² sigma 6000^4.

So F/F0 = [0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] /6000^4.

Which is 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4.

Which is 0.6 + 0.4*(0.48225) = 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929.

So, dip is 1-0.7929=0.2071→ 20.7% dip.

So, Rpl = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈0.455 R.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, perhaps option A is the closest, but that's 0.39, which gives a dip of about 15%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed, and the planet's radius is such that it blocks the same amount of flux as the spots, considering the temperature difference.

Wait, the star's flux without spots: F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ), but we're considering relative flux.

When the planet transits, it blocks an area of pi Rpl^2, causing a dip of (pi Rpl^2) * sigma T_eff^4 / (4 pi Rstar^2 sigma T_eff^4 ) ) = (Rpl^2)/(4 Rstar^2) * 4 → wait, no, the flux is F = sigma T_eff^4 * (pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ), so the dip is (pi Rpl^2) / (pi Rstar^2) ) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The dip caused by the spots is 0.2071.

So, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈0.455 R.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the spots are cooler. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says the spots are 1000 K cooler than the star, which is 6000 K. So, T_spot =5000 K.

So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the radius of the spots as the same as the planet. So, the area of the spots on the star's surface is 0.4 pi R². The planet must block the same area as the spots, so pi Rpl^2 = 0.4 pi R² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the planet's radius such that the area it blocks is 20% of the star's area, which would be Rpl = sqrt(0.2) R ≈0.447 R. Closest option is A) 0.39, but not exact.

Wait, but the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

If the dip is 20.7%, then Rpl=0.455 R. But that's not an option.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, 0.11, but I don't see how that aligns.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial problem setup.

Wait, the problem says that the star's radius is the same as the Sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a 20% filling factor. So, the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The star's surface area is 4 pi R². So, the fraction is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1 → 10%.

So, the planet's area would be 10% of the star's area. The star's area is 4 pi R². So, planet's area is 0.1 *4 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The planet's area is pi Rpl² → 0.4 pi R² = pi Rpl² → Rpl² = 0.4 R² → Rpl = sqrt(0.4) R ≈ 0.632 R.

But none of the options are close. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the planet's radius such that the area blocked is 20% of the star's cross-sectional area (pi R²). So, 20% of pi R² is 0.2 pi R². So, the planet's area is 0.2 pi R² → pi Rpl² =0.2 pi R² → Rpl²= 0.2 R² → Rpl= sqrt(0.2)=0.447 R. Closest option is A) ~0.39.

But 0.447 R is closer to option D (0.32) than to option A (0.39). Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the calculations, the correct Rpl/Rstar is approximately 0.455, which isn't among the options. However, given the options, the closest match might be option A) ~0.39, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the F/F0 ratio. Let's re-calculate.

Compute F/F0: [0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] /6000^4.

Calculate each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 =6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 =5^4 *1e12=625e12.

0.6 *1296e12 =777.6e12.

0.4 *625e12 =250e12.

Sum =777.6e12 +250e12 =1027.6e12.

Divide by denominator:6000^4 =1296e12.

So F/F0 = 1027.6e12 / 1296e12 ≈ 0.7929.

So, dip is 20.7%.

So Rpl/Rstar =sqrt(0.207) ≈0.455.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, which is approximately sqrt(0.152) → dip of 15.2%.

But why would the problem lead us to that? Perhaps the problem intended to have the spots' filling factor as 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

Let me try that.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star (4 pi R²), then the area is 0.2 *4 pi R² =0.8 pi R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area visible is 0.8 pi R² * 0.5 = 0.4 pi R².

So, the fraction of the visible area is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4.

So, F/F0 = [0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] /6000^4 =0.7929 as before.

So, dip is 20.7% → Rpl=0.455 R.

Still no match.

Perhaps the problem expects me to use the area of the spots on the star's surface as 20% of the area, so 0.2 *4 pi R² =0.8 pi R². When the hemisphere is facing us, the area visible is 0.8 pi R² * 0.5 =0.4 pi R², which is 40% of the visible area.

So again, F/F0=0.7929 → dip 20.7% → Rpl=0.455 R.

Hmm.

Since I can't find a way to match the options, perhaps the intended approach is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the planet's radius such that the area it blocks during transit equals the area of the spots on the star's surface. The spots' area on the star's surface is 0.4 pi R² (from 20% of the hemisphere's 2 pi R² area).

So, the planet's area is pi Rpl^2 =0.4 pi R² → Rpl^2=0.4 R² → Rpl= sqrt(0.4) R ≈0.632 R. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the planet's radius such that the area blocked is 20% of the star's cross-section (pi R²). So, 0.2 pi R² =pi Rpl^2 → Rpl^2=0.2 R² → Rpl= sqrt(0.2) R≈0.447 R. Closest option is A) ~0.39.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the planet's radius to be such that the same amount of flux is blocked as the spots, but the calculation is done differently. For example, perhaps the problem uses the average brightness variation over the rotation period.

Wait, but I've tried that and it leads to the same dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness as the spots rotate, leading to a sinusoidal variation, and the amplitude is half the dip I calculated. So, the maximum dip is 20.7%, so the amplitude (peak-to-peak) is 20.7% of the star's brightness.

Wait, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the planet that would cause the same light curve variation as the spots, which would include both the dip and the rise as the spots rotate in and out of view. But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

At this point, I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 0.455 R, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, which is the closest to the square root of 0.152 (15.2% dip), but I'm not sure why the dip would be that low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me recheck.

Wait, when the spots are on the front, the star's brightness is F = 0.6 *6000^4 +0.4*5000^4.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done as:

The unspotted area on the visible hemisphere is 60% (0.6), and the spotted area is 40% (0.4).

So, the flux from the unspotted part is 0.6 * sigma *6000^4 * area_unspotted.

The area_unspotted is 0.6 * pi R².

The flux from the unspotted part is 0.6 * sigma *6000^4 * 0.6 pi R².

Wait, no, that's not correct. The area_unspotted is 0.6 pi R², so the flux is sigma *6000^4 * 0.6 pi R².

The flux from the spotted area is sigma *5000^4 *0.4 pi R².

So, total flux F = sigma (6000^4 * 0.6 pi R² +5000^4 *0.4 pi R²).

The normal flux F0 = sigma 6000^4 * pi R².

So F/F0 = [0.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ] /6000^4.

Which is 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 =0.7929.

So dip is 20.7%, leading to Rpl=0.455 R.

So, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option A) ~0.39, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation in a star's light curve as the star's dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature of 5000 K. The goal is to find the planet's radius relative to the star's radius, \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \), that would mimic the brightness variation caused by the spots.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star's Flux Without Spots**:  
   The star's total flux without spots is proportional to its surface area and effective temperature:  
   \[
   F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot \text{Surface Area} = \sigma (6000)^4 \cdot 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
   \]

2. **Star's Flux With Spots**:  
   When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions are calculated separately:  
   - Unspotted area: \( 0.6 \cdot \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), emitting at \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - Spotted area: \( 0.4 \cdot \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), emitting at \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  
   The total flux is:  
   \[
   F = \sigma \left[ 0.6 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4 \right] \cdot \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
   \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:  
   The ratio of the spotted flux to the normal flux is:  
   \[
   \frac{F}{F_0} = \frac{0.6 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4}{(6000)^4}.
   \]
   Substituting \( (5000/6000)^4 \approx 0.48225 \):  
   \[
   \frac{F}{F_0} = 0.6 + 0.4 \cdot 0.48225 = 0.7929.
   \]
   The dip in brightness is:  
   \[
   \text{Dip} = 1 - \frac{F}{F_0} = 1 - 0.7929 = 0.2071 \, \text{(20.71%)}.
   \]

4. **Planet's Brightness Variation**:  
   The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet's radius relative to the star's radius:  
   \[
   \text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
   \]
   Setting the planet's dip equal to the spotted dip:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2071 \implies \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.2071} \approx 0.455.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.455 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A) ~0.39**, which corresponds to a smaller dip of approximately 15.2%. It is unclear why the problem's setup or options do not align with the calculated result.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately \( 0.455 \), but since this is not among the options, the closest match is **A) ~0.39**. This discrepancy may arise from an error in the problem's setup or interpretation.
