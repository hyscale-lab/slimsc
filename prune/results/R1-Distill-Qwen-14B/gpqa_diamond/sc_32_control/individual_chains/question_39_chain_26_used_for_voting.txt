Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about quantum mechanics, specifically wave functions. So, the setup is that there's a large number of identical systems—10,000 particles, all the same and under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. Wait, i is the square root of -1, right? So this is a complex wave function. But when they measure the position, none of the particles are found at x < 1 or x > 3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3 when measured.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. Okay, so what do I remember about wave functions in quantum mechanics? I think the wave function squared (the probability density) must integrate to 1 over all space because the total probability is 1. That's normalization, right? So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. 

Wait, but the wave function here is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex part. To find the probability density, I need to compute the square of the magnitude of the wave function. Which is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the magnitude squared is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because when you square the magnitude, you do (Re)^2 + (Im)^2.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's the correct expression. Now, the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 should be 1. Because the particle must be somewhere between 1 and 3, and nowhere else.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

Let me write that down:

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

I can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each part separately.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C. So evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 divided by ln(2). Let me think, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213). Let's calculate that.

What's sqrt(0.7213)? Well, 0.85 squared is 0.7225 (since 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.85^2 is 0.7225). Oh wait, 0.85 squared is exactly 0.7225. But our a² is about 0.7213, which is just a little less. So a is approximately sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), imaginary part is -0.5.

2. The probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

3. Integrate this from x=1 to x=3. So ∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

4. Split into two integrals: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a² ln(2), and ∫0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.5.

5. So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.85.

Yes, that seems correct. So the correct answer is option B, 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where \( i \) is the imaginary unit. The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability must integrate to 1 over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
