Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, right. Stability constants, those are for the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The formula, I think, for each complex is Co(SCN)_n^2-n or something like that. So the complexes would be Co(SCN), Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃, and Co(SCN)₄, I guess, with each n having a β value.

But wait, the problem mentions "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands. So which complexes are those? Oh, I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, so Co(SCN)₂²+? Or maybe it's a different charge. Wait, let me think. The stability constants go from β1 to β4, so each β corresponds to the complex with n ligands where n is 1,2,3,4. So β1 is Co(SCN), β2 is Co(SCN)₂, β3 is Co(SCN)₃, and β4 is Co(SCN)₄.

Wait, no, maybe the complexes are different. Oh wait, no, the stability constant for each successive addition. So each β represents the formation of the next complex. So β1 is the formation of the first complex, Co(SCN), from Co²+ and SCN⁻. Then β2 is the formation of Co(SCN)₂ from Co(SCN)+ and SCN⁻, and so on.

So the problem is about the distribution of all possible cobalt species. The total cobalt concentration is given, which is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the species [Co²+], [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃], [Co(SCN)₄] should equal 1e-2 M.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are [Co(SCN)] and [Co(SCN)₂], but wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the blue is a particular complex where n is 2. Because in other contexts, I've heard that the [Co(SCN)_n] complexes have different colors. For example, Co(SCN) is pink, Co(SCN)_2 is blue, then maybe others are different colors. So the question specifically refers to the blue ones, which would be the dithiocyanato complexes, so n=2. So that's [Co(SCN)₂²+] perhaps.

Wait, no, the question says "dithiocyanato", which would mean two SCN⁻ ligands. So the complex would be Co(SCN)₂²+. So the species is Co(SCN)₂²+.

But wait, all the options are percentages, so I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)₂²+ in the total cobalt species.

So, the approach is to calculate the concentration of each complex, then sum them up and find the percentage for the desired one.

But how to calculate each concentration given the stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻?

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be modeled using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The general approach is to use the expression for each complex's concentration in terms of the free metal ion concentration and the ligand concentration, multiplied by the appropriate β.

The formula for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n

Wait, no, the stability constant β_n is defined as:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co²+] [SCN^-]^n )

So, rearranged, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n

But wait, each β_n is the cumulative stability constant, meaning that β_n is the overall formation constant for the complex up to n ligands. Or are they stepwise? Wait, no, I think they are stepwise. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, sometimes β can be the overall constant for the entire complex, meaning for the nth complex, it's the product of the stepwise constants. So for example, β1 = K1, β2 = K1*K2, β3 = K1*K2*K3, etc. Wait, but in this problem, the given βs are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's a bit odd because β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower. So maybe β1 is the first step, β2 is the second step, etc. So each βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth ligand.

Wait, but if that's the case, the overall β for each complex would be the product of β1 through βn. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the stepwise formation constants are K1 (for Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²+), K2 (CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂²+), etc. So the overall β for the first complex is K1, for the second, it's K1*K2, for the third, K1*K2*K3, etc.

But in this problem, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is K1, β2 is K1*K2, β3 is K1*K2*K3, and β4 is K1*K2*K3*K4.

Wait, but in that case, β2 would be K1*K2 = 40, and since β1 is 9, K2 would be 40/9 ≈4.444.

Similarly, β3 is 63 = K1*K2*K3 = 9 * (40/9 ) * K3 → 40 * K3 =63 → K3=63/40 =1.575.

And β4 is 16= K1*K2*K3*K4 =9*(40/9 )*(63/40 )*K4 → 9*(40/9)=40; 40*(63/40)=63. So 63 * K4 =16 → K4=16/63 ≈0.254.

Wait, but that may complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the βs given are the overall stability constants for each complex. So β1 is the overall for CoSCN²+, β2 is for Co(SCN)₂²+, etc. So each complex's β is given as a separate value, not as a product of steps. But that's not how stability constants usually work. Usually, βn is the overall for the nth complex, which is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that each β_n is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So each [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n.

So, the total cobalt is the sum of all the species:

Total Co = [Co²+] + [CoSCN²+] + [Co(SCN)₂²+] + [Co(SCN)₃²+] + [Co(SCN)₄²- ]

Wait, wait, the charge on the complexes depends on n. For example, Co²+ plus n SCN⁻ (each -1) gives a complex with charge 2-n. So for n=1, CoSCN²+ (charge 2-1=1+), but wait, that's not possible. Because Co²+ plus one SCN⁻ (charge -1) would make CoSCN²+ → charge +1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe each SCN⁻ is a ligand that's neutral when bound, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, SCN⁻ is a -1 charge ligand. So when it binds to Co²+, each SCN- contributes a -1. So the complex:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}.

So for n=1: CoSCN^0. Wait, 2+ plus 1*(-1) → +1. So the complex would have a +1 charge. Hmm, but that's possible only if it's in solution with an anion. But perhaps in solution, the charge isn't as important as the concentration, so maybe the charge doesn't directly affect the distribution, except in terms of how much ligand is available.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the charge isn't directly relevant, because the key is the concentration of each species based on K and ligand concentration.

So the problem is to find the distribution of each cobalt species based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

So, the first step is to write expressions for each [Co(SCN)_n], and then find their sum.

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n.

So all the [Co(SCN)_n] are proportional to [Co²+] and [SCN^-]^n, multiplied by β_n.

But [Co²+] is the free ion concentration, which is the same in all terms. But [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but wait. The total concentration of SCN⁻ is given as 0.1 M. But when calculating [Co(SCN)_n], each complex consumes n SCN⁻ ions. So the actual concentration of free SCN⁻ would be lower than 0.1 M because some is tied up in complexes.

Hmm, now that complicates things. Because the ligand concentration in solution isn't just 0.1 M, but is actually [SCN^-] = 0.1 - sum(n * [Co(SCN)_n]).

But this makes the problem much more complicated, because the [SCN^-] is not a fixed value anymore; it depends on the concentrations of the complexes.

So, perhaps to model this, we need to let x be the free Co²+ concentration. Then, each [Co(SCN)_n] can be expressed in terms of x and [SCN^-], but [SCN^-] is 0.1 - sum(n * [Co(SCN)_n}).

This seems complicated, but maybe we can make an approximation. Since the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M, which is higher than the total Co concentration (1e-2 M), perhaps the ligand isn't depleted too much. So [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid approximation. Let me think. The total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. Each Co forms up to 4 SCN complexes. So the maximum ligand consumed would be 4 * 1e-2 = 0.04 M. The initial SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, so 0.04 is only 40% of 0.1, so maybe the approximation holds. But I'm not entirely sure, but for the sake of solving the problem, perhaps it's acceptable to proceed with [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the change in [SCN^-], treating it as constant. So it's a common approximation in such problems, especially when the ligand concentration is much higher than the metal concentration.

So, if I proceed under that assumption, then [SCN^-] = 0.1 M for all calculations.

So, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN²+] = β1 * x * (0.1)^1
[Co(SCN)₂²+] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2
[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 * x * (0.1)^3
[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β4 * x * (0.1)^4

Wait, but the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but wait, if β1 is the overall constant for the first complex, then what about higher complexes? Because each subsequent β would be the overall constant, not the stepwise. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing because stepwise constants are usually multiplied. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given β's are the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is K1 (the first step), β2 is K2 (the second step), etc. Then, the overall β for the nth complex is the product K1*K2*...*Kn.

In that case, the overall β for the first complex (n=1) is K1=β1=9.

The overall β for the second complex (n=2) is K1*K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, for n=3: β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 9 *40=360; 360*63=22680.

For n=4: 9*40*63*16 = 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but that seems a bit high for β3 and β4. But maybe that's how it is.

So, using this approach, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = (overall βn) * [Co²+] * [SCN^-]^n.

But then, the βn is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So, for each n:

n | β (overall) = product of K1 to Kn
1 | 9
2 | 9*40=360
3 | 9*40*63=22680
4 | 9*40*63*16=362880

Wait, but then the [Co(SCN)_n] would be:

[Co(SCN)_1] = β1 * x * (0.1)
[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 * x * 0.01
[Co(SCN)_3] = 22680 * x * (0.1)^3 = 22680 *x * 0.001 = 22.68 x
[Co(SCN)_4] = 362880 * x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 *x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x

Wait, but adding all these up:

Total Co = x + (9 * 0.1)x + (360 * 0.01)x + (22680 * 0.001)x + (362880 * 0.0001)x

Let me compute each term:

x is [Co²+]=x

[CoSCN²+] =9 * x *0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)₂²+] =360 *x *0.01= 3.6 x

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] =22680 *x *0.001= 22.68 x

[Co(SCN)₄²-]=362880 *x*0.0001=36.288 x

So total Co = x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = sum all the coefficients:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5+22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So 64.468 x = total Co = 1e-2 M.

So x = (1e-2) /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, let me compute that. 1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551.

So x ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the [Co(SCN)]₂²+ concentration is 3.6 x.

So substituting x:

3.6 * 1.551e-4 ≈ 5.5836e-5 M.

Now, the total Co concentration is 0.01 M, so the fraction is [Co(SCN)₂²+] / 0.01 = (5.5836e-5) / 0.01 = 0.0055836, which is approximately 0.55836%? Wait, that can't be. That's less than a percent, but looking at the options, the lowest is 16.9% (option D). Hmm, but this approach must be wrong because the result is way too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the βs are the stepwise constants. Maybe the given βs are the overall constants for each n. So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n.

In that case, the [Co(SCN)_n] would be:

n=1: 9 * x * 0.1 =0.9 x

n=2:40 *x *0.01=0.4 x

n=3:63 *x *0.001=0.063 x

n=4:16 *x *0.0001=0.0016 x

So the sum of all Co species is:

x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = x (1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016) = x*(2.3646)

Set total Co to 0.01 M: 2.3646 x =0.01 → x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004225 M.

So x is approximately 4.225e-3 M.

Now, the [Co(SCN)₂²+] is 0.4 x → 0.4 * 4.225e-3 = 1.69e-3 M.

The percentage is ([Co(SCN)₂²+]/total Co)*100 → (1.69e-3 / 0.01)*100 =16.9%.

Wait, that's option D. But wait, the problem is about the dithiocyanato, which is n=2, so 16.9% would be the answer, which is option D.

But wait, in the earlier approach, where I treated the βs as stepwise, the percentage came out to be less than 1%, but that's not any of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is that each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

So, in this case, the [Co(SCN)₂²+] is 16.9% of the total Co, which would be option D.

But wait, the problem says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So this suggests that each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So, for n=1, β1=9; for n=2, β2=40, etc.

So then, the approach where [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n is correct.

So with that, the [Co(SCN)₂²+] is 40 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 x * 0.01 =0.4 x.

The sum of all species is x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x =2.3646 x.

Set to 0.01 → x=0.004225.

So [Co(SCN)₂²+] is 0.4 * 0.004225 = 0.00169 M.

Percentage: (0.00169 / 0.01) *100 =16.9%.

Which is option D.

Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I thought the blue ones were [Co(SCN)₂²+], so that's correct.

But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN⁻ ligands, so that's correct. So the answer would be D)16.9%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the blue complexes include more than just n=2. But I don't think so; the problem specifies "dithiocyanato" which is two.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂²⁺]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16), the total cobalt concentration ([Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃] + [Co(SCN)₄] = 10⁻² M), and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The stability constants are interpreted as the overall formation constants for the respective complexes.

### Key Equations
The concentration of each cobalt complex is given by:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
\]
where \( \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the \( n \)-th complex, \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \) is the free cobalt ion concentration, and \( [\text{SCN}^-] \) is the free thiocyanate ion concentration.

### Total Cobalt Concentration
The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Approximation for Free SCN⁻
Since the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻]) is 0.1 M, which is significantly higher than the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M), the depletion of SCN⁻ by complex formation is negligible. Thus, we approximate \( [\text{SCN}^-] \approx 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

### Calculations
Using the stability constants and the approximation \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), the concentrations of the cobalt complexes are:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1)^1 = 9 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}],
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}],
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_3] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}],
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_4] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}].
\]

The total cobalt concentration is:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4] = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016).
\]
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]
Thus:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot 2.3646 = 10^{-2}.
\]
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂²⁺]
The concentration of [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] is:
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 0.4 \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] = 0.4 \cdot 0.004225 \approx 0.00169 \, \text{M}.
\]
The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂²⁺] is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{\text{Total Co}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂²⁺]) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
