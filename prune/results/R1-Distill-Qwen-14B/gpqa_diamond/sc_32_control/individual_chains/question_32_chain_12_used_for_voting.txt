Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. So, if it has 3 neutrons, that means the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Next, I need to find the energy of the RHIC. The energy given in particle accelerators is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it refers to the total energy. Wait, but in the case of high-energy physics like RHIC, I think they often use the total energy, which includes the rest mass. Or wait, no, sometimes they just give the kinetic. Hmm, but wait, the problem says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So maybe they're considering the kinetic energy or the total energy. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the speed is given as 0.96c, so relativistic effects are definitely important here. So I should probably use the relativistic equations for energy and momentum.

Let me recall that the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0c². The gamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's calculate gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? So yeah, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Now, the mass of Li-6. Lithium has an atomic mass of about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. But we're dealing with a nucleus here, so we need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, actually, the exact atomic weight for Li-6 is about 6.941 g/mol. Hmm, but wait, that's the mass of one mole. So the molar mass is 6.941 g per mole. Therefore, the mass of one Li-6 atom is 6.941 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So the mass m0 is (6.941e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ) = 6.941e-3 / 6.022e23 kg per atom. Let me compute that:

6.941e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = approx 1.1524e-27 kg.

Wait, let me double-check that. 6.941 grams is 0.006941 kg. Divided by 6.022e23 gives about 0.006941 / 6.022e23 = 1.1524e-26 kg? Wait, no, 0.006941 divided by 6e23 is about 1.15e-26 kg, but wait, 6.941e-3 kg is 0.006941 kg, so 0.006941 / 6.022e23 = (6.941 / 6.022) * 1e-26 kg.

6.941 / 6.022 is approximately 1.152, so m0 ≈ 1.152e-26 kg.

Wait, but wait, that's the mass of a single Li-6 atom. But the nucleus is only the protons and neutrons. Wait, no, the mass we use in these calculations is the rest mass of the nucleus, which includes all nucleons. So that's correct. So m0 is approximately 1.152e-26 kg.

Now, the rest mass energy is m0c². Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

m0c² = 1.152e-26 kg * (3e8)^2 = 1.152e-26 * 9e16 = 1.152 * 9e-10 = 10.368e-10 J.

Wait, that's in joules. Let's convert that to GeV because the answer options are in GeV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So m0c² ≈ 1.0368e-9 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 6.47e9 eV = 6.47 GeV.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

m0c² = 1.152e-26 kg * (9e16 m²/s²) = 1.0368e-9 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0368e-9 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 6.47e9 eV = 6.47 GeV.

Wait, but Li-6 nucleus is actually more massive than a proton. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Because the molar mass is 6.941 g/mol, so per nucleus, it's 6.941 / (6.022e23) grams per nucleus, which is 6.941e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = 1.152e-26 kg per nucleus, same as before.

So m0c² is about 6.47 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times m0c². Gamma is approx 3.5714.

So E = 3.5714 * 6.47 GeV ≈ let's compute that.

3 * 6.47 is 19.41, 0.5714 *6.47 is approx 3.694. So 19.41 +3.694 ≈ 23.10 GeV.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me compute 3.5714 *6.47 exactly.

3 *6.47=19.41.
0.5714 *6.47 = let me compute that as 0.5 *6.47 =3.235, 0.0714*6.47≈0.461. So total 3.235+0.461=3.696. So 19.41+3.696=23.106 GeV.

So around 23.106 GeV.

But wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, option B is 23.069 GeV. Close to my calculation of 23.106, but perhaps I approximated too much.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's compute (0.96)^2:

0.96 * 0.96: 96*96=9216, so 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So 3.57142857 *6.47 GeV.

Wait, maybe the m0c² is exactly 6.47 GeV? Let me recheck.

Wait, m0c²= (mass of Li-6 nucleus) * c².

Wait, perhaps I should get a more precise value for the mass of Li-6 nucleus. The exact mass in atomic mass units (u) is about 6.941 u. But 1 u is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg.

So m0 = 6.941 u * 1.660539e-27 kg/u = 6.941 * 1.660539e-27.

Let me compute that:

6 *1.660539e-27 = 9.963234e-27,

0.941 *1.660539e-27 ≈approx 0.941 *1.660539 ≈ 1.5648e-27.

So total m0 ≈9.963234e-27 +1.5648e-27 = 11.528e-27 kg, which is 1.1528e-26 kg.

Which is what I had before. So m0c² is 1.1528e-26 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 1.0375e-9 J.

Convert to GeV: 1.0375e-9 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 6.475e9 eV = 6.475 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 *6.475 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.475.

First, 3 *6.475 = 19.425.

0.57142857 *6.475.

Compute 0.5 *6.475 = 3.2375.

0.07142857*6.475 ≈ let's compute 6.475 *0.07 = 0.45325.

6.475 *0.00142857 ≈ approx 0.00925.

So 0.45325 +0.00925≈0.4625.

So 3.2375 +0.4625=3.7.

So total E=19.425 +3.7=23.125 GeV.

Hmm, but the option B is 23.069 GeV. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values. Let me recalculate gamma.

(0.96c)^2 = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 3.57142857...

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.941 u, but perhaps I should use a more precise value for 1 u in kg.

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m0 =6.941 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute 6.941 *1.66053906660e-27:

Calculate 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632343996e-27.

Then 0.941 *1.6605390666e-27:

Compute 0.941 *1.6605390666.

0.9 *1.6605390666 = 1.4944851599.

0.04 *1.6605390666=0.06642156266.

0.001 *1.6605390666=0.0016605390666.

Add them together: 1.4944851599 +0.06642156266=1.56090672256 + 0.0016605390666= ~1.5625672616.

So m0 =9.9632343996e-27 +1.5625672616e-27 = 11.5258016612e-27 kg =1.15258016612e-26 kg.

So m0c² =1.15258016612e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

= 1.15258016612e-26 *9e16 = 1.0373221495e-9 J.

Convert to GeV: 1.0373221495e-9 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (1.0373221495 / 1.602176634) * 1e10 eV.

Calculate 1.0373221495 /1.602176634 ≈ 0.6473.

So 0.6473 * 1e10 eV = 6.473e9 eV =6.473 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² = 3.57142857 *6.473 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.473:

Let me compute this more precisely.

6.473 *3 = 19.419.

6.473 *0.57142857 = ?

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

6.473 * (4/7) = ?

6.473 *4 =25.892; divided by 7: 25.892 /7 ≈3.698857.

So 19.419 +3.698857 =23.117857 GeV.

Hmm, so about 23.1179 GeV.

But option B is 23.069 GeV. So why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Is the energy the kinetic energy or the total energy?

Wait, in accelerators, sometimes the energy given is the kinetic energy (K), not the total energy (E). So E = K + m0c².

So if the problem states that the energy of RHIC is the kinetic energy, then perhaps I should compute K and not E.

Wait, the question says: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

In accelerator physics, the kinetic energy is usually what is referred to as the "energy" of the beam. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy K.

So K = (gamma -1) m0c².

Earlier, I computed E = gamma m0 c² ≈23.1179 GeV.

If K = E - m0c² =23.1179 -6.473= approx 16.6449 GeV. That's nowhere near any option.

Wait, but the options are higher than that. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, which is E.

But according to my calculations, E is about 23.1179 GeV. The closest option is B:23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

So (v²)/(c²) =0.9216.

gamma =1/ sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is more precise. Let me look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

The exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.941 u, but perhaps it's actually 6.940943 u. Let me check.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941, but for Li-6, the exact mass is 6.940943 u.

So using m0=6.940943 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u.

Compute m0:

6.940943 * 1.6605390666e-27 = ?

Compute 6 *1.660539...e-27 =9.963234e-27.

0.940943 *1.6605390666e-27:

Calculate 0.940943 *1.6605390666.

0.9 *1.6605390666 =1.4944851599.

0.04 *1.6605390666=0.06642156266.

0.000943 *1.6605390666≈ 0.001566.

Adding these: 1.494485 +0.0664215=1.5609066; +0.001566=1.5624726.

So m0=9.963234e-27 +1.5624726e-27=11.5257066e-27 kg=1.15257066e-26 kg.

m0c²=1.15257066e-26 kg *9e16 m²/s²= 1.037313594e-9 J.

Convert to GeV: (1.037313594e-9 J) / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) = 6.47305 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *6.47305 GeV.

Let's calculate this accurately.

3.57142857 *6.47305:

Break it down:

3 *6.47305 =19.41915.

0.57142857 *6.47305.

Compute 0.5 *6.47305 =3.236525.

0.07142857 *6.47305 ≈ let's compute 0.07 *6.47305 =0.4531135, and 0.00142857 *6.47305≈0.009253.

So total 0.4531135 +0.009253=0.4623665.

So 3.236525 +0.4623665=3.6988915.

So total E =19.41915 +3.6988915=23.1180415 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 23.118 GeV.

But option B is 23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the mass is even more precise. Let me check the exact value of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.940943 u. So that's what I used.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation uses the rest mass energy of a proton and neutron. Let me think.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the rest mass is 3*(m_p + m_n).

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So each proton is 938.272 MeV, neutron 939.565 MeV.

So the total rest mass of Li-6 is 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV.

Compute that: 3*(1877.837 MeV) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Wait, that's different from the 6.47 GeV I calculated using atomic mass units. 

Wait, why the discrepancy? Oh because the mass of the nucleus is not just the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy. The nucleus has a mass deficit (mass defect) compared to the sum of individual nucleons.

Wait, so when using the rest mass of the nucleus, it's actually the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy (mass defect). So when I calculated using Li-6's atomic mass, I included the binding energy because the atomic mass already accounts for the mass defect.

But perhaps the approach I took earlier, using the exact atomic mass, is correct because it includes all the binding energies and other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the rest mass as the sum of individual protons and neutrons, but that would be incorrect because the nucleus's mass is less than that. 

Wait, in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons because of the mass defect due to binding energy. So I think using the exact atomic mass (6.940943 u) is the correct approach, as it already includes the binding energy.

Wait, but according to that, the rest mass energy is about 6.47 GeV, and the total energy is about 23.118 GeV.

Hmm, but the option B is 23.069 GeV. Close, but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857...

But perhaps using more precise calculation.

Wait, 0.96 is exact. So v=0.96c.

So beta=0.96, so beta²=0.9216.

1-beta²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the mass calculation is more precise, leading to a slightly lower total energy.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of m0c² is 6.47 GeV. Let me compute 1.15257066e-26 kg * (3e8)^2 = 1.15257066e-26 *9e16 =1.037313594e-9 J.

Convert to GeV:

1.037313594e-9 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (1.037313594 / 1.602176634) * 1e10 eV.

Let me compute 1.037313594 /1.602176634.

Hmm, 1.602176634 *0.647 =1.602176634 *0.6=0.96130598, 0.04*1.602176634=0.064087065, 0.007*1.602176634=0.011215236. So 0.647 *1.602176634=0.96130598 +0.064087065=1.025393045 +0.011215236=1.036608281.

Which is very close to 1.037313594. So 0.647 *1.602176634=1.036608281, which is a bit less than 1.037313594.

The difference is 1.037313594 -1.036608281=0.000705313.

So 0.000705313 /1.602176634 ≈0.00044. So 0.647 +0.00044=0.64744.

So m0c²=0.64744 *1e10 eV=6.4744 GeV.

So E=gamma * m0c²=3.57142857 *6.4744 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.4744.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6 =21.42857142.

3.57142857 *0.4744=?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.4=1.428571428.

3.57142857 *0.07=0.25.

3.57142857 *0.0044=0.01571324.

Adding those: 1.428571428 +0.25=1.678571428 +0.01571324=1.694284668.

So total E=21.42857142 +1.694284668=23.12285609 GeV.

Wait, so about 23.1229 GeV.

The closest option is B:23.069 GeV. Hmm, but this doesn't match. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the relativistic kinetic energy formula.

K = (gamma -1) m0 c².

But if I'm to find the total energy, including rest mass, it's gamma m0 c².

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the energy of RHIC. RHIC is a collider, so the energy per beam. I think since it's a collider, each beam has energy E, so the total collision energy is 2E. But perhaps the question is referring to each beam's energy. Wait, but the options are single values, so perhaps E is the energy per nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking the kinetic energy, but that would give a lower value.

Wait, but 23.12 GeV is a close option. However, the given options don't have that. The closest is option B:23.069 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is computed as the sum of protons and neutrons, but that would be incorrect. Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon, but that can't be because Li-6 has 6 nucleons.

Wait, maybe I should compute the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but that would be way higher than the actual mass due to binding energy. Let's see.

Mass of a proton: ~938 MeV/c².

Mass of a neutron: ~940 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 2814 MeV.

3 neutrons: 2820 MeV.

Total: 5634 MeV.

m0c²=5.634 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857.

E=gamma * m0c²=3.57142857 *5.634 GeV.

3 *5.634=16.902.

0.57142857 *5.634≈3.216.

Total E=16.902+3.216=20.118 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.118 GeV, which is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, that can't be right because the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. So the rest mass should be less than 5.634 GeV.

Wait, but when I used the atomic mass, I got m0c² around 6.47 GeV. But that's higher than 5.634 GeV. So that can't be correct. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the units earlier. Because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c².

Ah! That's a key point. I think I messed up the conversion from u to GeV.

Wait, let me correct that.

1 u = 931.5 MeV/c².

So if Li-6 is 6.940943 u, then m0c² =6.940943 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.940943 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.940943 *931.5 ≈ 876.3 MeV.

Total:5589 +876.3=6465.3 MeV=6.4653 GeV.

Ah! So m0c² is approximately 6.4653 GeV.

Ah, I see, earlier I was converting kg to GeV incorrectly. So the correct m0c² is about 6.465 GeV, not 6.473.

So, E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *6.465 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *6.465 =19.395.

0.57142857 *6.465 ≈3.703.

19.395 +3.703=23.1 GeV.

Wait, that's about 23.1 GeV.

Hmm, but the options have option B as 23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps using more precise numbers.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.4653.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6 =21.42857142.

3.57142857 *0.4653.

Compute that: 3.57142857 *0.4=1.428571428.

3.57142857 *0.06=0.214285714.

3.57142857 *0.0053=0.018929101.

Adding them:1.428571428 +0.214285714=1.642857142 +0.018929101=1.661786243.

So total E=21.42857142 +1.661786243=23.09035766 GeV.

Hmm, about 23.090 GeV, which is about 23.09 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV. Close, but not exact. Did I make a mistake in the exact value of gamma?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571.

But perhaps calculating using more precise decimal places.

Compute 1 - (0.96)^2=1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma remains 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps using the exact calculation:

E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *6.4653 GeV.

Let me compute 6.4653 *3.57142857.

6 *3.57142857=21.42857142.

0.4653 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.4 *3.57142857=1.428571428.

0.06 *3.57142857=0.214285714.

0.0053 *3.57142857≈0.018929101.

Adding:1.428571428 +0.214285714=1.642857142 +0.018929101=1.661786243.

So 21.42857142 +1.661786243=23.09035766 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 23.0904 GeV.

Hmm, but the option is 23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculation.

Wait, using a calculator for gamma:

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering only the kinetic energy, but that would give a lower value. Let's see.

K = (gamma -1) * m0c².

gamma=3.57142857.

gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 *6.4653 GeV.

Compute that:

2 *6.4653=12.9306.

0.57142857 *6.4653≈ let's compute 0.5 *6.4653=3.23265, 0.07142857 *6.4653≈0.4622.

Total K≈12.9306 +3.23265=16.16325 +0.4622=16.62545 GeV.

That's about 16.625 GeV, which isn't any option. So probably, the question refers to the total energy.

Hmm. So with all that, the closest option is B:23.069 GeV. But according to calculation, it's around 23.090 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check the exact value of Li-6.

Li-6's exact mass is 6.940943 u.

So m0c² =6.940943 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute exactly.

6.940943 *931.5.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.940943 *931.5.

Compute 0.940943 *900 =846.8487.

0.940943 *31.5=29.6445.

So 846.8487 +29.6445=876.4932 MeV.

Total m0c²=5589 +876.4932=6465.4932 MeV ≈6.4654932 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *6.4654932 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *6.4654932.

I'll do this step by step.

6.4654932 *3 =19.3964796.

6.4654932 *0.5=3.2327466.

6.4654932 *0.07=0.452584524.

6.4654932 *0.00142857 (approx 1/700)=0.009236.

Adding these together:

19.3964796 (from 3)
+3.2327466 (from 0.5)
=22.6292262.

Adding 0.452584524 →23.0818107.

Adding 0.009236 →23.0910467 GeV.

Wait, that's about 23.091 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, that's a difference of about 22 MeV. That's not a huge difference, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *6.4654932 using more precise methods.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.4654932:

=3.57142857 * (6 +0.4654932) 

=3.57142857 *6 =21.42857142.

Plus 3.57142857 *0.4654932.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.4 =1.428571428.

3.57142857 *0.06 =0.214285714.

3.57142857 *0.0054932 ≈0.019744.

So summing:1.428571428 +0.214285714=1.642857142 +0.019744=1.662601142.

So total E=21.42857142 +1.662601142=23.09117256 GeV.

So about 23.091 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more precisely.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.4654932.

3.57142857 *6.4654932.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.4654932.

Break it down:

Let me write it as:

(3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) *6.4654932.

=3*6.4654932 +0.5*6.4654932 +0.07142857*6.4654932.

=19.3964796 +3.2327466 +0.462524.

Wait, 0.5 *6.4654932=3.2327466.

0.07142857 *6.4654932 ≈ let's compute:

6.4654932 *0.07=0.452584524.

6.4654932 *0.00142857≈0.009236.

So sum is 0.452584524 +0.009236=0.461820524.

So total:

19.3964796 +3.2327466=22.6292262.

+0.461820524=23.0910467 GeV.

Still about 23.091 GeV.

Hmm, I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy between my calculation and the option given. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: the problem refers to the nucleus moving at 0.96c, but in a collider, the two nuclei are moving in opposite directions. The total energy would then be the sum of their energies. But in this question, perhaps it's only considering one nucleus's energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the entire atom, including electrons. Wait, that would be incorrect because the nucleus is considered without the electrons.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the mass number as the mass. For example, the mass could be approximated as A * (proton mass), but that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the atomic mass.

Li-6 has an exact atomic mass of 6.940942629 amu.

So m0c²=6.940942629 *931.5 MeV=6.940942629 *931.5.

Compute that:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.940942629 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 0.940942629 *900=846.8483661 MeV.

0.940942629 *31.5=29.6445242 MeV.

Sum:846.8483661 +29.6445242=876.4928903 MeV.

Total m0c²=5589 +876.4928903=6465.49289 MeV=6.46549289 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.46549289 GeV.

Compute this:

3 *6.46549289=19.39647867.

0.57142857 *6.46549289.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.5 *6.46549289=3.232746445.

0.07142857 *6.46549289.

Compute 0.07 *6.46549289=0.452584502.

0.00142857 *6.46549289≈0.009236.

So sum is 0.452584502 +0.009236=0.461820502.

So total 0.57142857 *6.46549289=3.232746445 +0.461820502=3.694566947.

So E=19.39647867 +3.694566947=23.09104562 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

So the energy is approximately 23.091 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recalculate gamma more precisely.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.0784).

But sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma=3.571428571428571.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is due to rounding in the problem's options. The calculated value is approximately 23.091 GeV, but the option is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV (22 MeV) less. That's within the realm of possible calculation errors if the problem expects an approximate approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of beta = v/c =0.96, but to compute gamma using a different method, perhaps with more precise calculation.

Wait, another approach: calculate gamma using the exact formula.

gamma = (1 - beta²)^(-1/2).

Beta =0.96.

Beta squared=0.9216.

1 - beta²=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is solved using the total energy formula, E=gamma * m * c², where m is the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is taken as 6.941 GeV/c².

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6.941 amu is 6.941 *931.5 MeV=6.465 GeV. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations point to approximately 23.09 GeV, but the closest option is B:23.069 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I can look for a more precise calculation approach. Let me compute everything step by step with more precise decimal places.

Compute m0c²:

Li-6: exact atomic mass=6.940942629 amu.

m0c²=6.940942629 amu *931.496589 MeV/amu =6.940942629 *931.496589 MeV.

Calculate 6 *931.496589=5588.979534 MeV.

0.940942629 *931.496589=?

Compute 0.9 *931.496589=838.3469301 MeV.

0.040942629 *931.496589 ≈ let's compute:

0.04 *931.496589=37.25986356 MeV.

0.000942629 *931.496589≈0.877 MeV.

So sum: 37.25986356 +0.877≈38.13686356 MeV.

So total m0c²=5588.979534 +838.3469301=6427.326464 +38.13686356=6465.463327 MeV=6.465463327 GeV.

So E=gamma * m0c²=3.57142857 *6.465463327 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *6.465463327.

Break it into 3 *6.465463327=19.39639.

0.57142857 *6.465463327.

Compute 0.5 *6.465463327=3.2327316635.

0.07142857 *6.465463327=0.4618204367.

So total for 0.57142857 part:3.2327316635 +0.4618204367=3.6945521.

So E=19.39639 +3.6945521=23.090942 GeV.

Hmm, about 23.0909 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV. That's about 0.022 GeV difference, which is 22 MeV. That's within the precision of maybe using more precise values for gamma or mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of gamma ≈3.570 instead of 3.5714? Let me see.

If gamma were 3.570, then E=3.57 *6.465463327≈23.070 GeV.

Ah! So perhaps the intended approach is to calculate gamma as approximately 3.57 instead of the more precise 3.5714.

So 3.57 *6.465463327=?

3 *6.465463327=19.39639.

0.57 *6.465463327=3.6943.

Total E=19.39639 +3.6943=23.0907 GeV.

Hmm, no, that's still about 23.0907 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses gamma as 3.570.

Wait, gamma=3.570.

E=3.570 *6.465463327.

3 *6.465463327=19.39639.

0.57 *6.465463327=3.6943.

So 19.39639 +3.6943=23.0907 GeV.

Hmm, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of beta=0.96 and uses a different method for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the approximation gamma ≈ 3.570, leading to E≈23.069 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the kinetic energy formula, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is referring to the center-of-mass energy, but in a collider, the total energy is the sum of both beams. But in this case, it's asking for the energy of the RHIC, which I think is the energy per beam.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is using the proton mass instead of the nucleus mass, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using precise values would give 23.069 GeV when rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, 23.0909 GeV is approximately 23.091 GeV, which rounds to 23.09 GeV. But the option is 23.069 GeV, which is a bit lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and should recheck.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *6.465463327 precisely.

3.57142857 *6.465463327.

Compute 3.57142857 *6 =21.42857142.

3.57142857 *0.465463327.

Compute 0.4 *3.57142857=1.428571428.

0.06 *3.57142857=0.214285714.

0.005463327 *3.57142857≈0.019531.

Adding those:1.428571428 +0.214285714=1.642857142 +0.019531=1.662388142.

So total E=21.42857142 +1.662388142=23.09095956 GeV.

Hmm, still about 23.091 GeV.

I think the issue is that the problem's option is approximate, and perhaps the intended answer is option B:23.069 GeV, but due to calculation precision, it's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the mass calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the entire atom, including electrons. Let's see:

Li-6 has an atomic mass of 6.940943 amu. The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 amu. A neutral Li atom has 3 electrons. So the mass of the atom including electrons would be 6.940943 +3*0.00054858=6.94247 amu.

So m0c²=6.94247 amu *931.5 MeV/amu=6.94247 *931.5 MeV.

Compute:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.94247 *931.5 MeV= let's compute:

0.9 *931.5=838.35 MeV.

0.04247 *931.5≈39.55 MeV.

So total m0c²=5589 +838.35=6427.35 +39.55=6466.9 MeV=6.4669 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *6.4669= let's compute:

3 *6.4669=19.4007.

0.57142857 *6.4669=3.6945.

So E=19.4007 +3.6945=23.0952 GeV.

Hmm, that's even higher.

Wait, but this approach is incorrect because the nucleus is being considered, not the entire atom. So including electrons would be wrong.

I think I've tried every approach I can think of, but I can't get exactly 23.069 GeV. Perhaps the intended answer is option B, 23.069 GeV, and perhaps the problem uses some approximations in the calculations, leading to this value.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the nucleus**: The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of 6.940943 atomic mass units (amu).  
2. **Relativistic energy formula**: The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m_0 c^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m_0 \) is the rest mass, and \( c \) is the speed of light.  

3. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
   \]

4. **Rest mass energy (\( m_0 c^2 \))**:  
   Using \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy of Li-6 is:  
   \[
   m_0 c^2 = 6.940943 \, \text{amu} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \approx 6465.5 \, \text{MeV} = 6.4655 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

5. **Total energy (\( E \))**:  
   Substituting into the relativistic energy formula:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 6.4655 \, \text{GeV} \approx 23.091 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

6. **Compare with options**:  
   The calculated energy is approximately \( 23.091 \, \text{GeV} \). The closest option is **B) 23.069 GeV**, which is within a reasonable margin of error due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

Thus, the energy of the RHIC is most consistent with option **B**.  

ANSWER: B
