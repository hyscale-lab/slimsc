Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that we mix HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, so all three are being mixed together. I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve acids reacting with bases to form water and a salt, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when these three solutions are mixed. Let's list out each chemical:

1. HCl is a strong acid. When dissolved, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl- ions. So, 0.2 M HCl would mean 0.2 M H+.

2. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid but, wait, is it diprotic? Yeah, the first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-, and the second is also pretty much complete, giving another H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+ but the second H+ is weaker? Or is it that the first dissociation is complete, and the second is not? No, wait, no, I think it's that the first dissociation is 100% complete, but the second one is about 90% or something. But for neutralization purposes, do I consider both H+ ions available? Hmm, maybe the problem assumes both are available because sometimes in problems, especially when dealing with strong acids, they consider both H+ ions as part of the acid's contribution.

Wait, but wait. The problem says H2SO4 is 0.3 M. So each molecule would contribute two H+ ions? So for n factor, the equivalent would be 2 per mole.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- when dissolved. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH^- ions.

So the neutralization reaction is between H+ from the acids (HCl and H2SO4) and OH- from the base (Ba(OH)2). The reaction is:

H+ + OH^- → H2O, which is exothermic, and the enthalpy change is usually around -57 kJ/mol per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Or is it per mole of H2O formed? Because each mole of H2O formed releases about 57 kJ.

So the first thing I need to do is calculate the total moles of H+ available from both HCl and H2SO4, then calculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2, and see which is in excess. Because the neutralization will depend on the limiting reactant.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H+ ions. So when calculating the H+ from H2SO4, it's 2 times the moles of H2SO4.

Similarly, Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per mole. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So let's compute the moles for each:

HCl: volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Concentration is 0.2 M, so moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since it's a strong acid, each mole gives one H+. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Concentration 0.3 M, so moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives two H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Concentration 0.5 M, so moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, so the H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles.

In neutralization, each H+ reacts with an OH- to form water. So the OH- is the limiting reactant here because 0.2 < 0.28. So not all H+ will react. How much will react?

The OH- is 0.2 moles. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

But wait, wait. I think in neutralization, the H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So the amount of H+ that reacts is equal to the amount of OH- available, which is 0.2 mol. But the total H+ available is 0.28, so 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol of H+ left over.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Wait, when H2SO4 is a strong acid, does it dissociate completely both H+ ions? Or does the second H+ dissociate only partially? I think for the purpose of this calculation, unless stated otherwise, we can assume that H2SO4 is a strong acid and both H+ ions are available. So the initial calculation seems correct.

So, the enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. Since OH- is the limiting reactant (0.2 mol), all of it will react, producing 0.2 mol of H2O, and the excess H+ is 0.08 mol (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08).

But wait, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change per mole is about -57,000 J/mol, which is -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed.

So the total enthalpy change (ΔH) would be moles of H2O formed multiplied by the enthalpy per mole. Moles of H2O formed is 0.2 moles. So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me check the units. The options have some in kcal and some in kJ. So I need to make sure which unit to use.

Wait, the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, -11.4 kJ is approximately -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, maybe the strong acid's second H+ doesn't contribute because I'm mixing them in a solution. Or maybe I'm considering the net reaction correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Wait, in neutralization, the equivalents are important.

For HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 equivalents (since each HCl gives 1 H+).

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles, each giving 2 H+, so 0.18 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles, each giving 2 OH-, so 0.2 equivalents.

So total equivalents of H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Equivalents of OH- = 0.2.

The neutralization will proceed until the lower equivalent is used up. So OH- is 0.2, which is less than 0.28. So 0.2 equivalents of H+ will react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, wait, the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, so perhaps the problem uses calories instead of kilojoules.

Wait, because 1 cal is about 4.184 J. So 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is about 13608 cal (since 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 57000 /4.184 ≈ 13608 cal). So per mole of H2O, it's about -13608 cal.

Wait, that's a lot. But wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization given is per mole in kcal. Wait, I thought it's around -57 kcal/mol? No, wait, no, 57 kJ/mol is about 13.6 kcal/mol. Wait, because 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 57000 J is 57000 /4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, that makes sense. So each mole of H2O formed releases about 13.6 kcal.

So if 0.2 moles are formed, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-13.6) ≈ -2.72 kcal. Wait, that's option A.

But wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it's 0.2 moles. Let me recalculate.

Wait, I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal. Let me clarify:

Enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O. So 57,000 J per mole.

1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57,000 J is how many kcal?

57,000 / 4184 ≈ approximately 13.6 kcal.

So per mole of H2O, it's -13.6 kcal.

So if 0.2 moles are formed, it's 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

But wait, earlier I thought that the calculation would be -11.4 kJ, which is about -11.4 (but that's in kJ). But the options have option D as -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's see what I did wrong.

Wait, I think I messed up the units. Let me redo the calculation.

First, the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- is exothermic, and the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Alternatively, per mole of H2O formed.

So, the total H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options give D as -16.0 kJ. So why isn't D the answer?

Alternatively, maybe I should compute in terms of equivalents.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

H+ from acids: 0.28 moles (from HCl and H2SO4).

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 moles), so 0.2 moles of H2O are formed.

Each mole of H2O releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. But since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, so -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal). Wait, no, wait:

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So -11.4 kJ is -11.4 * 0.239 ≈ -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

But earlier I thought the correct answer was -11.4 kJ. So why is option B present? Because option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be if we have 0.2 moles multiplied by 57.2 kcal per mole or something.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong enthalpy value. What's the standard enthalpy of neutralization?

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of acid (monoprotic). So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that all the H+ from H2SO4 is available, and perhaps we have an excess H+.

Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the H2SO4 is 0.3 M in 0.3 L → 0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the acid's H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

So, OH- is limiting. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ → 0.2 moles H2O.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have -11.4 kJ except option D is -16.0 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, wait. Maybe the problem isn't just about the H+ and OH- reacting. Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4 (a diprotic acid), perhaps the reaction is more involved.

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions. HCl is a monoprotic acid, H2SO4 is diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that can accept two H+ ions.

So when mixed, the H+ ions from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But perhaps the H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, both of which might react.

Wait, but the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles, so each mole of Ba(OH)2 can take two H+, so 0.2 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, no, because each OH- neutralizes one H+. So 0.2 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

The H+ available is 0.28, so after neutralization, 0.08 moles of H+ remain.

So the total H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

But that's option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the H+ from H2SO4 as two equivalents, but perhaps the reaction is not complete because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and not all H+ are available, but that's unlikely because the problem states that it's a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total equivalents.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total acid equivalents and the total base equivalents.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 N (since it's monoprotic) → 0.1 equivalents.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 * 2 (diprotic) → 0.3 *0.3=0.09 moles, each gives 2 equivalents → 0.18 equivalents.

Total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 * 2 → 0.2 *0.5=0.1 moles, each gives 2 equivalents → 0.2 equivalents.

So, acid equivalents are 0.28, base equivalents are 0.2. So the base is limiting, and 0.2 equivalents will neutralize, leaving 0.08 equivalents of acid.

So, the neutralization produces 0.2 equivalents of water, which is 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Which is -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. Oh, wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, wait. Let me convert -11.4 kJ to kcal. Since 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal, so 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

But earlier I concluded it's -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization," which typically refers to per mole of reaction, but perhaps in this case, they're just calculating the total.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the total heat released when all the H+ and OH- react, but considering that not all H+ are neutralized.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is the limiting reagent, so the reaction stops when OH- is fully consumed, leaving some H+.

So the total enthalpy change is based on the moles that actually react, which is 0.2 moles of H2O.

So if the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole, then it's -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (because 11.4/4.184 ≈ 2.72).

So the answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -49.4 kJ. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H+ as -57 kcal/mol. That would be a mistake, because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the wrong units. Let me check.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol, not kcal. So if the problem expects the answer in kcal, but I've got -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal, so option A.

But then why is option B at -11.42 kcal? That would be if the calculation was 0.2 moles * 57.1 kcal/mol, which is about 11.42 kcal. But that would mean the enthalpy per mole is 57 kcal/mol, which is incorrect because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each mole of H2SO4 as contributing one H+ instead of two. Let me consider that scenario.

If H2SO4 is only considered as providing one H+ (monoprotic), then the H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 moles, and from HCl 0.1 moles, total 0.19.

OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is still in excess? Wait, no, because 0.19 < 0.2. So the H+ is the limiting reagent.

Wait, but that would change the calculation.

Wait, in that case, the H+ available is 0.19. OH- is 0.2. So all 0.19 H+ would react, producing 0.19 moles of H2O. The OH- would have 0.01 moles left.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.19 * (-57) kJ = -10.83 kJ.

Which is about -2.56 kcal (since 10.83 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.56).

But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but the problem states that H2SO4 is 0.3 M. So, if it's a diprotic acid, both H+ would be available.

So my initial calculation seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem considers the neutralization as H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2 first, and then the excess H+ from HCl.

Wait, let's think about the reactions.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

So, for each mole of Ba(OH)2, one mole of H2SO4 is needed, and two moles of H2O are produced.

But wait, how does that work?

Wait, the reaction for a strong diprotic acid (H2SO4) and a strong base (Ba(OH)2):

H2SO4 (2 H+) + Ba(OH)2 (2 OH-) → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, the balanced equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, for each mole of H2SO4, you need one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce two moles of H2O.

In this problem, we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4 and 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2.

So, H2SO4 is limiting here because 0.09 < 0.1.

So, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.18 moles of H2O.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles, which gives 0.02 moles of OH-.

Now, the HCl has 0.1 moles of H+.

So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.02 moles. They will react with H+ from HCl.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.02 moles of OH- will react with 0.02 moles of H+ from HCl, producing 0.02 moles of H2O.

So, the total H2O produced is 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction) + 0.02 (from HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 moles.

So, the total H2O is 0.2 moles, same as before.

So, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Which is about -2.72 kcal. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is the option B -11.42 kcal? That would suggest 0.2 moles at 57.1 kcal/mol, which is 11.42.

But wait, 57.1 kJ is about 13.7 kcal.

So, 0.2 *57.1 kJ is 11.42 kJ → 11.42 kJ is about 2.73 kcal.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, but then it's about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total enthalpy, not per mole. But the way the question is phrased, it's to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these solutions are mixed. So the total would be -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we analyze the reaction between the acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The neutralization reaction is:

\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids
1. **HCl**:  
   Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Concentration = 0.2 M  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄**:  
   Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Concentration = 0.3 M  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, each mole contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

**Total H⁺ from acids**:  
\[
0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂
Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L, Concentration = 0.5 M  
Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant
The neutralization reaction occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio of H⁺ to OH⁻.  
- Moles of H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \)  
- Moles of OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \)  

Since OH⁻ is present in smaller quantity, it is the limiting reactant. All \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ will react, neutralizing \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺. This produces \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O.

### Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of H₂O formed.  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Step 5: Convert to kcal
Since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \):  
\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The calculated enthalpy change is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
