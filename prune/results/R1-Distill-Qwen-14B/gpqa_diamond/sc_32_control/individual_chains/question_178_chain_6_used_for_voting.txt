Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of parameters like coupling constants is important because it tells us about renormalizability. Let's try to think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int equals κ times ψ bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) times the commutator of gamma matrices, [γ_μ, γ_ν]. So σ_{μν} is an antisymmetric tensor, right? And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism since F is usually for gauge fields like photons.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I'll consider the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action (which is ∫ L d^4x) is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me list out the fields and their dimensions. Fermion fields ψ, like electrons, have a mass dimension of 3/2 each. So ψ bar is also 3/2. The F^{μν} field strength tensor for a gauge field (like the photon) has a mass dimension of 2. Because the field A has dimension 1, the derivatives in F would add 1 to each, so F is ∂A which is 2.

Now, the σ_{μν} term: since it's a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (I think), and the structure is from the commutator, which doesn't add any mass dimension. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Putting it all together, the term inside the Lagrangian is ψ bar σ ψ F. Let me compute the dimensions of each part:

ψ bar has dimension 3/2, ψ is 3/2. So ψ bar ψ would be 3/2 +3/2=3. Then, because σ is dimensionless, the ψ bar σ ψ part is 3.

Then multiply by F^{μν}, which is 2. So overall, the term is 3 +2=5. But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling κ must have a dimension that brings this down to 4. So the product κ * (term) has to be dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ bar σ ψ F] = 4. Since [ψ bar σ ψ F] is 5, [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That narrows it down to options A or C.

Next, determine if the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories have interactions with coupling constants that have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 - 4? Wait, wait. I think the rule is that a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has mass dimension greater than or equal to zero. Because the dimension tells you the superficial degree of divergence. Or wait, another way: the interaction term in the Lagrangian must have a dimension ≤4.

Wait, the term is L_int, which has dimension 4. The coupling κ has dimension -1. Now, in terms of renormalizability, the interaction term is allowed if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ (4 - (sum of fields' dimensions)).

Wait, no. Another approach: in renormalizable theories, the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if their dimension is negative, the interaction becomes more relevant at higher energies, leading to possible non-renormalizable divergences.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The general rule is that an interaction term is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ (4 - sum of the fields' dimensions). Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Wait, the interaction term is part of the Lagrangian (so it must have dimension 4). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. The coupling κ is multiplied by some fields, so the sum of the fields' dimensions plus the dimension of κ must equal 4.

In this case, the fields in the term are ψ bar σ ψ F. As before, ψ bar has 3/2, ψ 3/2, F 2. So the sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5, plus [κ]=-1, totals 4. So the term is okay.

But for the theory's renormalizability, we look at the dimension of the coupling. If the dimension is positive, it's renormalizable; negative implies non-renormalizable.

Wait, I think the correct criteria is that a coupling constant is renormalizable if its dimension is ≥ (4 - d), where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, but I think that's for operators in the Lagrangian. Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence is determined by the dimension. If the superficial degree is positive, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the power counting. The interaction term's dimension is 4, and the coupling's dimension is [κ]=-1. So when you have a Feynman diagram with a vertex, the coupling's dimension contributes. For a theory to be renormalizable, all divergences should be handled by counterterms already present in the Lagrangian.

Alternatively, the degree of divergence can be found by the formula D = 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions) - [coupling].

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me get back. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is:

L = κ ψ bar σ F ψ.

Each field's dimension: ψ bar is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So sum of fields' dimensions is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5. The dimension of L must be 4, so [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1, which matches what I found earlier.

Now, for renormalizability, the coupling κ must have a dimension that's ≥ 0. Because if the dimension is negative, each order in the coupling becomes more significant at higher energies (since the dimension is negative, the coupling grows with energy). So this would require an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

In this case, [κ]=-1, which is less than zero. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Putting it all together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory renormalizable, which can't be right because κ is negative.

Wait, but wait, could I have made a mistake about the renormalizability criteria? Let me think again. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ 0. Because if [g] <0, each additional vertex increases the number of factors of g, leading to more divergences, requiring more counterterms.

So since [κ]=-1, which is <0, the theory is non-renormalizable. So the correct option is C. Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action $\int \mathcal{L} \, d^4x$ is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must therefore also have mass dimension 4.

- The fermion fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $3/2$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term, being a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, is dimensionless.

The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following dimensions:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]
To ensure the Lagrangian has dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the interaction terms do not introduce divergences that require an infinite number of counterterms. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term becomes more significant at higher energies, requiring an infinite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
