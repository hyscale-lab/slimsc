Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to remember.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, that might be a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no. Oh right, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, but I think that's a way of writing 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because the 'd' might stand for two substituents, like two methyl groups. Wait, no, maybe it's a typo. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes they denote substituents with numbers and letters. So 'd' could mean two substituents, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl-1-bromo benzene.

Wait, but let me not get stuck there. Let's assume it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the structure would have a bromine at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 on the benzene ring.

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, like elimination. Also, in aromatic substitution, sometimes it's used for dehydrohalogenation to form rings with double bonds, like in the formation of alkenes.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, when you have a benzene ring with a leaving group like bromine, and you use a strong base like NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps this is a Friedel-Crafts type reaction? No, no, because Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3, and typically involves alkylation or acylation. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires activating groups, like electron donating groups, because the ring has to be activated for nucleophilic attack. But 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene... Let me think: the ring has methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Methyl is an activating group (electron donating by the +I effect), so the ring is activated. So maybe the base is removing H+ from a position, leading to a substitution.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. In aromatic substitution, using a strong base might lead to a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, if the ring is activated, perhaps it's more about elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzyne intermediate.

Oh, right! I remember that when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can eliminate to form benzyne. But wait, in this case, we have only one bromine and two methyl groups. So maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 2,4-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene. So if we have NaNH2, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, to form benzyne, you typically need two leaving groups in adjacent positions, right? Because when they are eliminated, you form a triple bond, making benzyne.

But in this molecule, the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups are at 2 and 4. So positions 1, 2, 4 are substituted. So that leaves positions 3, 5, and 6 available. Hmm, but how would elimination work here?

Alternatively, perhaps the base is abstracting a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine. So, if the bromine is at position 1, then positions 2, 3, and 6 are adjacent. But wait, position 2 has a methyl group. So the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 3 or 6, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but let me think about the structure again. 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the ring has Br at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

If I remove a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (which has a methyl group). Wait, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and 4. So, if I eliminate H from position 3 and the Br from position 1, that would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2? Or between 1 and 3?

Wait, no. Wait, elimination typically forms a double bond between the positions where the H and the leaving group were. So if Br is at position 1, and the H is abstracted from position 2, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. But in this molecule, position 2 has a methyl group, which is a substituent. So that might affect the possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, the ring becomes a benzene with a triple bond. No, wait, benzyne is a triple bond, but that requires adjacent leaving groups. So perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Maybe it's a substitution. Bromine is a leaving group, and maybe another group substitutes it. But with NaNH2 being a strong base, perhaps it's more about deprotonation and elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond (like making a styrene-like structure). But in our case, the ring already has substituents, so the possible sites for elimination would dictate the products.

Wait a minute, in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the bromine is at position 1. So let's number the benzene ring:

Positions:

1: Br

2: CH3

4: CH3

So the ring looks like this: positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), 4 (CH3). So what are the possible positions adjacent to Br?

Adjacent positions are 2, 6, and perhaps 3? Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So the hydrogen that can be abstracted would be either from position 2 or 6.

But position 2 already has a methyl group. So the hydrogens available would be on position 6 and position 3 (since position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4, but not adjacent to Br, wait no—position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 6 or maybe from position 3? Wait, no, position 3 is not adjacent to position 1. Wait, no: benzene has each carbon connected to two others. So position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. Position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. Position 3 is connected to 2 and 4. Position 4 is connected to 3 and 5. Position 5 is connected to 4 and 6. Position 6 is connected to 5 and 1.

So, the hydrogens adjacent to Br (position 1) are on carbons 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl group, so the H's on carbon 2 are not available (since the substituent is CH3). Thus, the only available H's adjacent to Br would be on position 6. Therefore, the base (NaNH2) would abstract a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

But wait, the ring would lose Br and form a double bond, right? So the elimination would produce a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 6, but that would require that the Br is at 1 and the H is at 6. So the product would be 1,6-didehydrobenzene? Or perhaps another way of looking at it is that the benzene ring becomes a cyclohexene ring with substituents.

Wait, but in reality, when elimination occurs from bromobenzene, you get a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already aromatic, so forming a double bond would imply that the ring is still aromatic. But how?

Wait, perhaps elimination forms an antiaromatic compound, but that's unlikely because benzene is more stable as aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like forming a substituted cyclohexa-1,3-diene or something else. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, leading to a substituted styrene. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. The reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. This is a strong base, so it's likely to cause elimination. In such cases, dehydrohalogenation occurs, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So, in this case, the product would be 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond between positions 1 and 2? Wait, but if the H is abstracted from position 2, which already has a methyl group, that's not possible because the H's on position 2 are part of the CH2 group in the methyl? No, wait, the methyl group is attached to the ring. So the CH3 at position 2 is directly attached to the ring. So the H on position 2 is attached to the same carbon as the methyl. But wait, the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, so each methyl is on a ring carbon.

So, when NaNH2 abstracts a beta hydrogen, say from position 6 (which is adjacent to position 1 where Br is attached), and the Br leaves, a double bond forms between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent only to position 5 and 1. So the double bond would be between 1 and 6, making the ring have a double bond at that position.

Wait, but after elimination, you lose HBr, and the ring gains a double bond.

So the product would be 1,3-dimethyl-1,6-didehydrobenzene? Wait, that's not a correct way to name it. Alternatively, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, and methyl groups at C2 and C4.

Wait, but let's think about the positions. If the double bond is between C1 and C6, then the ring would have substituents at 1 (now part of a double bond), 2 (CH3), and 4 (CH3). So the structure would have a CH2 group at position 1 (since it's part of a double bond, it can't have the Br anymore). Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled up in the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count the double bond between 1 and 2, but that's impossible because position 2 has a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond in the meta position relative to the methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but forms a benzene ring with a substituent replacing the bromine.

Wait, another angle: NaNH2 can deprotonate the ring, especially at positions that are activated. The methyl groups are activating, so perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a position that's ortho or para to the methyl groups, leading to a substitution.

Wait, but our starting material has Br at position 1. So let's look at the positions. The methyl groups are at 2 and 4.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to the methyl at position 2 and position 4, maybe that leads to a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by an amide group from NaNH2. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. But wait, methyl groups are activating (electron donating), which make the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So nucleophilic substitution is less likely here.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possibility of forming a benzene ring with a triple bond, like benzyne. But for that, you typically need two adjacent halogens to eliminate and form the triple bond. Since our starting material only has one Br, that's not feasible.

Wait, but wait. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's para to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. Or perhaps the ring undergoes some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution, where the Br is replaced by another group from the ammonia. But NaNH2 is a source of NH2- which is a strong base, but perhaps in this case, it could act as a nucleophile.

Wait, but the ring is activated towards electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So substitution of Br by NH2- would require that the ring is deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an aniline derivative. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. For example, when bromobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination to form phenylene, but that's under specific conditions. Wait, but in this case, the substituents might influence the possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a substituted styrene. Let me think: the bromine at position 1 is eliminated along with a hydrogen from position 6, forming a double bond between 1 and 6. So the product would be 6-methyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-dimethylbenzene with a double bond between 1 and 2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible positions where elimination can occur. If the Br is at position 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Since position 2 has a methyl group, the H can be abstracted from position 6. So elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6, and the Br would leave. So the product would be 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene with a double bond between 1 and 6—no, wait, after elimination, the Br is gone. So the ring would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but benzene is already a ring with alternating double bonds. So adding another double bond would disrupt that. Oh, wait, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexene, but that's a six-membered ring with a single double bond.

But wait, the ring is still a benzene ring; introducing a double bond would require the structure to have two double bonds, but that's not possible because benzene already has three double bonds in a conjugated system. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a ring with a triple bond—benzyne. But as I thought earlier, benzyne typically forms when two adjacent halogens are present, which is not the case here. So that can't happen.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the product possibilities.

Another thought: NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction. Wait, no, the Birch reduction uses NH3, NaNH2, and a solvent like ethanol. But that's for aromatic rings, typically to reduce them to cyclohexadienes. But in our case, the ring already has substituents. But wait, wait, Birch reduction requires a metal catalyst, like Na in liquid NH3. I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a substituted cyclohexene. So the product would be a cyclohexene ring with substituents.

But wait, the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative. So elimination would produce a cyclohexene ring with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted phenylacetylene, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a Grignard-like compound, but with NaNH2, that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible products.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. When NaNH2 is added, which is a strong base, perhaps the H adjacent to Br is abstracted, leading to elimination of Br- and forming a double bond.

So the possible positions for H abstraction are adjacent to Br, which are positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has a methyl group, so the H's there are not available. Thus, the only available H is from position 6.

So elimination occurs, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

So the product would be 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene? No, wait, no. Wait, after elimination, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between 1 and 6.

Wait, but the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So after elimination, the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 6, making it 1,6-didehydro-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

But wait, is that a possible structure? Alternatively, perhaps the ring isn't flat anymore, but it's more likely to form a conjugated diene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as forming a substituted styrene. So the product would be 6-methyl-1,3-dimethylbenzene with a double bond between 1 and 2? No, that's not right.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let's think about the elimination. The Br is at position 1, and the H is at position 6. So when they eliminate, the double bond forms between 1 and 6, leading to a cyclohexene ring with methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and methyl groups at C2 and C4.

So the product would be 1,6-didehydro-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But is that a possible structure?

Wait, but benzene is a planar structure with three double bonds. Introducing another double bond would disrupt that. So perhaps the product is a substituted vinyl benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the product as a ortho-dimethylstyrene. So the double bond is between positions 1 and 2, but position 2 has a methyl group, so that's possible.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, which is adjacent to the Br at position 1, but position 2 already has a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2Br-C6H4-CH3, but no, that's not right.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should sketch this out.

But without drawing, let me think again: positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), 4 (CH3). The adjacent positions to Br are 2 and 6. So the only available H is from position 6. So elimination occurs between Br (position 1) and H (position 6), forming a double bond between 1 and 6.

So the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but benzene is a ring with alternating double bonds. How would adding another double bond fit into that?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexadiene, with two double bonds. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination but via substitution. But I don't see a good leaving group for substitution in this case.

Another angle: perhaps the reaction is a C-H activation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with an NH2 group. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think about the possible products when 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene reacts with NaNH2.

If elimination occurs, the product would be a substituted cyclohexene. But how many such products are possible?

Wait, the possibility of different regiochemistry. Since the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 6, but what about position 3? Wait, position 3 is not adjacent to Br, so elimination from there isn't possible. So only position 6 is available.

Hmm, so only one product from elimination. But wait, what about the possibility of forming different isomers?

Wait, after elimination, the double bond could be between 1 and 6, but is that the only possibility?

Alternatively, perhaps the base could abstract a hydrogen from a different position if there are multiple Hs available, but in this case, only position 6 is available.

So the product would be 1,6-didehydro-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is 1,6-dimethyl-1,2-didehydrobenzene or something like that.

Wait, but how many products? Only one possible elimination product, right? Because only position 6's H is available for elimination.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other possible reactions? Perhaps if the base is strong enough, could it deprotonate the ring in another way, leading to a different product?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a possibility of forming multiple isomers due to different positions of the substituents, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: after elimination, could the double bond form in a different position due to ring rotation or resonance?

No, the ring is rigid, so the double bond would be fixed between 1 and 6.

Therefore, only one product is possible from elimination.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. What if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 5 instead?

Wait, position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (which has a methyl group), but not directly adjacent to the Br at position 1. So the H at position 5 isn't beta to the Br, so elimination from there isn't possible. So only position 6 is available for H abstraction leading to elimination.

Thus, only one product would form.

Wait, but the options given are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

So if there's only one product, the answer would be B)1.

But wait, am I certain about that? Could there be more than one product?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but as substitution. Let me think again.

If the ring is activated by the methyl groups, substitution could occur. But substitution would require that the NH2- group from NaNH2 acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ring where the Br is.

But for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be highly activated, typically with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Methyl groups are electron-donating, which activate the ring for electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic.

Thus, substitution by NH2- is less likely. So more likely, elimination is the main pathway.

Thus, only one product would form.

So the answer should be B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction likely proceeds via elimination rather than substitution. The starting material has a bromine atom at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 on the benzene ring.

For elimination to occur, a β-hydrogen adjacent to the bromine must be abstracted. The β-hydrogens are located at positions 2 and 6. However, position 2 is already substituted with a methyl group, making the hydrogens on that carbon unavailable for elimination. Therefore, the only available β-hydrogen is at position 6, which is abstracted by the base. This leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

The resulting product is 1,6-didehydro-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Since there is only one possible site for elimination (position 6), only one product is formed.

Thus, the number of possible organic products in this reaction is **1**.

Answer: B
