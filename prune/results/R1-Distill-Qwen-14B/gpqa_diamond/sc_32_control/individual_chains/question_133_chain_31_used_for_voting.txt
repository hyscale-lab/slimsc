Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll take it step by step. Let's read the problem carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? Because phosphate comes in different forms depending on how many H's are attached. So H3PO4 is triprotic, meaning it can donate three protons. The problem gives me the Ka values for each dissociation step: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions.

Wait, what's the deal with the two compounds here? KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K H2PO4. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it should dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. 

So I think the solution will have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Because these are conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-. 

But wait, the question is asking about PO4^3- concentration. So I need to find how much of each salt contributes to PO4^3- in the solution.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The salts themselves won't directly release PO4^3- because they are in intermediate forms. For example, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-. So the PO4^3- must come from the dissociation of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

So maybe I should consider the phosphate species present in solution and how they equilibrate.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a buffer solution situation. Because H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid-base pairs, right? So the solution might be a buffer. 

But wait, the question is about PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. So maybe the concentration of PO4^3- is very low because it's the third dissociation.

But wait, the given K values are Ka1, Ka2, Ka3. So for H3PO4:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12

So each step has a much smaller Ka than the previous, meaning each subsequent deprotonation is harder. So PO4^3- is the least concentrated species.

But in the solution, I have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. So the solution is a mixture of these two. Wait, but how does that affect the PO4^3- concentration?

I think I can model this using the K expressions for each dissociation.

But maybe I should first calculate the concentrations of each phosphate species in the solution before considering their interactions.

So let's calculate the molar amounts of each salt.

First, for KH2PO4:

Mass = 1.00 g, Mw = 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Similarly for Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Mass = 1.00 g, Mw = 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005608 mol.

So, KH2PO4 gives 0.00734 mol of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 0.005608 mol of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005608 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.02804 M.

Wait, but the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, correct.

But wait, the problem is about PO4^3- concentration. So how do I find that?

Hmm. So PO4^3- is formed by the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the H+ concentration.

But wait, the solution also has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- which can act as acids and bases. So I think the H+ concentration in the solution is important here.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the phosphate system using the relevant K expressions.

Wait, but H2PO4^- can also act as an acid. It can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So the solution is a buffer solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

In such a buffer, the H+ concentration can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, maybe let's use that. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-):

pKa2 = log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = log( (0.02804)/(0.0367) )

Wait, let me compute that.

pKa2 = log(0.02804 / 0.0367) = log(0.764) ≈ 0.116.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) )

Wait wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log( [base]/[acid] )

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, no: wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.02804 / 0.0367) ≈ 7.208 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.208 + (-0.116) ≈ 7.092.

So the pH is approximately 7.09.

But wait, the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will influence the H+ concentration, which in turn affects the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

So now, knowing the pH, I can find the H+ concentration.

[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Now, let's think about the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02804 M, and [H+] is 8.21e-8 M.

Plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.21e-8.

Let me compute that.

First, calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 ≈ 5.0472e-14.

Denominator: 8.21e-8.

So 5.0472e-14 / 8.21e-8 = approx 6.146e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.146e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made some approximations.

Wait, let me do the calculations more accurately.

Compute [HPO4^2-]: 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005608 mol. Moles in 0.2 L: 0.02804 M.

[H2PO4^-]: 1.00 g KH2PO4 / 136.09 = 0.00734 mol, 0.0367 M.

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.2076.

Then, pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02804/0.0367) = 7.2076 + log(0.764) = 7.2076 + (-0.1155) = 7.0921.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0921) ≈ 8.205e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.205e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 = 5.0472e-14.

Divide by 8.205e-8: 5.0472e-14 /8.205e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.205) * 1e-6.

5.0472 /8.205 ≈ 0.6153.

So 0.6153e-6 = 6.153e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I need to consider activity coefficients or something else, but I don't think that's expected here. Alternatively, maybe my Henderson equation approach is incorrect.

Wait, I thought the Henderson equation applies when the buffer is made of a weak acid and its conjugate base. In this case, H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the base, so the approach should be correct.

Wait another thing: when I added both salts, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But is there any other source of PO4^3-?

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2- and H+. Because in solution, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which in turn can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.

So, the PO4^3- concentration also comes from the two dissociations, but perhaps the contribution is minimal because Ka3 is so small.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, I only considered the PO4^3- from HPO4^2- dissociation. Is there any contribution from H2PO4^- via two steps?

Alternatively, maybe the PO4^3- is formed through two consecutive dissociations, but given the small Ka3, perhaps the main contribution is from HPO4^2-.

Wait, let me think. The H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but then HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

So the overall reaction from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- is:

H2PO4^- → 2H+ + PO4^3-.

The overall K would be Ka2 * Ka3.

So, with [H+] being 8.2e-8, the concentration of H+ squared would be (8.2e-8)^2 = ~6.7e-15.

But wait, the contribution of H2PO4^- to PO4^3- would be negligible compared to the contribution from HPO4^2-.

So perhaps I can ignore that.

So the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but the computed [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.15e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly. So perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Let's do the calculation with more accurate numbers.

Compute [HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 M.

[H+] = 8.205e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.205e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 = 5.0472e-14.

Denominator: 8.205e-8.

5.0472e-14 / 8.205e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.205) * 1e-6.

5.0472 /8.205 = let me compute this.

5.0472 ÷ 8.205 ≈ 0.6153.

So 0.6153e-6 M is 6.153e-7 M.

Hmm, the options given are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

So our calculated value is approximately 6.15e-7, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7). The difference is about 0.01e-7, which is negligible given the significant figures in the problem.

Wait, but wait. Let me check my initial calculation of the moles. Did I compute the moles correctly?

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00734 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005608 mol.

Yes, that looks correct.

Wait, another thing: when Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolves in water, does it release 2 H2O molecules? Probably, but in solution, the H2O is negligible. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005608 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02804 M, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer and all the phosphate species are in equilibrium.

But wait, another approach: The total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] + [H3PO4].

But in solution, H3PO4 is negligible because it's a weak acid and we're dealing with its conjugate base forms.

But in reality, I think the primary contributors are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because their concentrations are much higher than PO4^3-.

But perhaps I can compute the exact [PO4^3-] by considering all the equilibria.

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Each can lose a proton to form the next species.

So, let's denote:

Let [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b, [PO4^3-] = c.

From the initial dissolution, a = 0.0367 M, b = 0.02804 M, and c is what we're trying to find (initially, c ≈ 0).

But upon dissolution, these will equilibrate. So, we can write the expressions for each dissociation.

For H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-: Ka2 = [H+][b] / [a].

For HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-: Ka3 = [H+][c] / [b].

So, combining these two:

From the first equation: [H+] = (Ka2 * a) / b.

Substituting into the second equation: Ka3 = ((Ka2 a)/b) * [c]/b → Ka3 = (Ka2 a [c]) / (b²)

So, solving for c: c = (Ka3 b²) / (Ka2 a)

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12, b = 0.02804, a = 0.0367.

c = (1.8e-12 * (0.02804)^2) / (6.2e-8 * 0.0367)

Compute numerator: 0.02804 squared is approximately 0.000786.

Multiply by 1.8e-12: 0.000786 * 1.8e-12 = 1.4148e-15.

Denominator: 6.2e-8 * 0.0367 = 2.2814e-9.

So c = (1.4148e-15) / (2.2814e-9) = approximately 6.215e-7 M.

That's about 6.215e-7, which is about 6.22e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

So this method gives a slightly higher value. Why? Because in the previous approach, I accounted for the pH, but perhaps this approach is more accurate because it directly relates the two dissociation steps without relying on the pH calculation.

So, the correct answer is approximately 6.22e-7 M, which is closest to option A.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors I'm missing? For example, activity coefficients or the fact that the solution is not ideal? Probably not, since the problem doesn't mention those, so we can proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution might have a different pH due to other factors. But the problem doesn't provide any other information, so the buffer approach using the two salts should be the way to go.

So, the correct answer should be option A: 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the presence of KH$_2$PO$_4$ and Na$_2$HPO$_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$. The solution contains $1.00 \, \text{g}$ of each salt dissolved in $200.00 \, \text{cm}^3$ ($0.2 \, \text{L}$), and the dissociation constants for phosphoric acid ($\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$) are provided: $K_{a1} = 7.5 \times 10^{-3}$, $K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$, and $K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}$.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH$_2$PO$_4$**:  
  $\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}$.  
  Dissociates to give $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$: $[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.00734}{0.2} = 0.0367 \, \text{M}$.

- **Na$_2$HPO$_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$**:  
  $\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005608 \, \text{mol}$.  
  Dissociates to give $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$: $[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005608}{0.2} = 0.02804 \, \text{M}$.

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution is a buffer containing $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ (acid) and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$ (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} \right),
\]  
where $\text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208$. Substituting the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02804}{0.0367} \right) \approx 7.208 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$
The concentration of $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ arises from the dissociation of $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}, \quad K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]  
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}.
\]  
Rearranging for $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_{a3} [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]  
From the pH, $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.21 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}$. Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02804)}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]  
First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02804) \approx 5.0472 \times 10^{-14}.
\]  
Then, divide by the denominator:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0472 \times 10^{-14}}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ is approximately $6.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$, which is closest to option **A) $6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$**.

ANSWER: A
