Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles across energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote E_1 as the higher energy level and E_2 as the lower. Wait, but the question says the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, the number of atoms in the excited state is higher in star_1.

Wait, let me clarify: the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the population in the excited state (say, level 1) is twice that in star_2. So, n1_1 / n1_2 = 2, and similarly for star_2, n2_1 / n2_2 = some value.

But wait, the ratio between the excited and ground states depends on the temperature and the energy difference. So, for each star, the ratio of n_i to n_j is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me write the expressions for each star. Let's assume that the lower energy level is the ground state, so n_j is the ground state population, and n_i is the excited state.

For star 1: n1_1 / n1_2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: n2_1 / n2_2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

But the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So, n1_1 is twice n2_1? Wait, no. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, perhaps the ratio n1_1 / n1_2 is twice the ratio n2_1 / n2_2.

Wait, let me think. The question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, the population in that energy level is higher by a factor of two in star_1. Or perhaps the excitation potential is higher? Maybe not. Let me recheck the wording.

In the photosphere of star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the excitation is higher. So, the number in the excited state is higher. So, n1_1/n1_2 = 2 * (n2_1/n2_2) ?

Wait, maybe I should set up the equations. Let's denote the ratio for each star as:

R1 = n1_1 / n1_2
R2 = n2_1 / n2_2

According to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

But the Boltzmann equation says R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights (g1 and g2) are the same for both stars because it's the same element and same energy levels. So, g1/g2 is a constant, same for both stars.

So, R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )
R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

So, R1 = 2 * R2 → (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k_B T1)) ) = 2 * (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so we get exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me rewrite that.

Wait, R1 = 2 * R2 → [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] = 2 [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Wait, that's correct.

Taking natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, I need to find an equation involving T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE. So perhaps the equation can be written as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But without knowing the value of ΔE, perhaps the equation is in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but the options are equations that ln(2) equals something in terms of T1 and T2. Let me look at the options.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, but in our equation, we have:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm, but the options don't have ΔE. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the ratio of R1 to R2. Let me try that.

R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Given that R1/R2 = 2, because R1 is twice R2.

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

But again, the equation in the options doesn't have ΔE. So perhaps the problem assumes that the energy difference is known and can be used, but in the options, the equation is written without it. Wait, perhaps I should reorganize the equation.

Wait, perhaps the equation can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is the Boltzmann constant (approx 1.38e-23 J/K), substituting these in would make the right-hand side ( ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) → ln(2) / (1 K) → so the equation becomes (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)/1 K.

But I'm not sure if that's the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio is n1_1 / n1_2 = 2 * (n2_1 / n2_2 )

Which gives: exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = 2

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Taking ln: ΔE/(k) ( (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln 2

Which can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln 2 ) / ΔE

But since ΔE is given, and k is known, but the question is about the equation for T1 and T2, perhaps the equation can be rearranged to ln(2) = something.

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE. This suggests that perhaps the correct equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals some expression involving ln(2). Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So, if (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln 2)/ΔE, but ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So (k ln2)/ΔE = (ln2)/1 K.

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/ (1 K)

But that would imply that (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K), but the units don't seem to match. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the units here.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I should look at it is that the equation in the options is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But from our earlier setup, ln(2) is equal to (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but that would mean that (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). Which can be rearranged as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2) *k ) / ΔE.

But if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then (k/ΔE) = 1/K. So (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln 2) / (1 K) → (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K)

But that suggests that (T1-T2) would have units of K^2. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should express the equation as (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( (k ln 2) ) / ΔE ). Since both k and ΔE are in J/K and J, respectively.

Wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So, k/ΔE is (1.38e-23 J/K)/(1.38e-23 J) )= 1/K.

So, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln 2) * (1/K) ) → which would imply that (T1-T2) is in K^2. But temperatures are in K, so perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the constants and focus on the expression in terms of T1 and T2.

So, going back, the equation we derived is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln 2) / ΔE.

But since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so (k ln 2)/ΔE = (ln 2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln 2 / K.

So, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln 2 / K.

But that can't be right because the left side is unitless (since it's a ratio of K^2) but the right has units of 1/K.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute (k/ΔE):

k = 1.38e-23 J/K
ΔE = 1.38e-23 J

k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/K.

So, (k ln2 )/ ΔE = (ln2) * (1/K)

So, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln2) * (1/K) → which would mean that (T1-T2) must be in K^2, but that's not possible because T1 and T2 are in K.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I considered R1 = 2 R2, but maybe it's the other way around. Because if star_1 has more excitation, the ratio n1_1/n1_2 would be higher than in star_2.

Let me re-express: R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

If R1 = 2 R2, then:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But since ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is the same, k = 1.38e-23 J/K, substituting:

[ ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ] / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) * (1/K)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / K → but that seems dimensionally inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I should express the equation as (T1 - T2) = (ln(2) * k T1 T2 ) / ΔE.

Let me plug the numbers:

k is 1.38e-23 J/K, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

So,

(T1-T2) = [ ln(2) * 1.38e-23 J/K * T1 T2 ) ] / 1.38e-23 J

The 1.38e-23 terms cancel, so:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) * (T1 T2) / K → but K is in denominator, so T1 - T2 = (ln 2) T1 T2 / K.

But that would require (T1 T2) to have units of K^2, which they do, and T1-T2 is in K. So,

(T1 - T2) = [ ln(2) * T1 T2 ] / K

But that doesn't directly fit any of the given options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the temperatures. Let me define a variable, say x = T1 / T2. Then, T1 = x T2.

Substituting into the equation:

(T1 - T2) = (ln2) * T1 T2 / (k/ΔE) )

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, let's go back to the equation:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But since ΔE is given, perhaps the equation can be written as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) k ] / ΔE

And as I calculated earlier, k/ΔE is 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1})

But 1 K^{-1} is 1/K, so it's (T1-T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2 / K.

Hmm, but this doesn't directly match any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But according to our equation, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals ln(2) / K.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor, like the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k_B * 1 K, since k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, 1 K * k_B = 1.38e-23 J.

So, ΔE = k_B * 1 K.

So, substituting into our equation:

(ΔE/k_B) = 1 K

Then, (ΔE/(k_B)) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(1 K) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which gives:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / K

But then that would mean that (T1-T2) has units of K^2, which isn't possible. So perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the ratios. Let me re-express the initial setup.

Wait, the ratio of excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2. So, R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2

So,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is,

(ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But with ΔE = k, since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, substituting ΔE = k * 1 K.

So,

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ln(2) * k ] / (k * 1 K) ) → simplifies to ln(2) / (1 K) → which is ln(2) * (1/K)

Wait, but that would mean that (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / K → but the units don't match. Because the left side is unitless (since all terms are in K), and the right is 1/K.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm missing a step. Alternatively, maybe the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ), as in option D.

But that would only be the case if the equation I derived leads to (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE) ), but if k/ΔE = 1 K^{-1}, then (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/(K), which doesn't make sense because the left side is unitless.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct equation is option D. Let me think: If the energy difference is small, which it is, then higher temperatures would lead to higher excitation. So, if star_1 has higher excitation, T1 is higher than T2.

In our equation, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

But since ΔE = k * T_diff, where T_diff is 1 K, then [ ln(2) * k ] / (k * T_diff ) ) = ln(2)/(T_diff), so:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/( T_diff )

But T_diff is 1 K, so it's ln(2).

Wait, that would make (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2), which matches option D.

Ah, I think I see. Because ΔE = k * T_diff, where T_diff is 1 K. So, substituting that into our equation:

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / (k * T_diff ) ) → (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/ T_diff.

Since T_diff is 1 K, the equation becomes (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So, the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 ), which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Setup
1. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This means the ratio of populations in the excited state to the ground state is twice as large in star_1 compared to star_2:
   \[
   \frac{n_{1,1}}{n_{1,2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{2,2}}.
   \]

2. Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratios for the two stars are:
   \[
   \frac{n_{1,1}}{n_{1,2}} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right),
   \]
   \[
   \frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{2,2}} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
   \]

3. Taking the ratio of these two equations:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{n_{1,1}}{n_{1,2}}}{\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{2,2}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right)}.
   \]

4. Substituting the given ratio \( \frac{n_{1,1}}{n_{1,2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{2,2}} \), we get:
   \[
   2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]

5. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
   \]

6. Rearranging the terms:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

### Simplification
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant \( k_B \) is also \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Substituting these values:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

### Final Answer
This matches **Option D**, which states:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
