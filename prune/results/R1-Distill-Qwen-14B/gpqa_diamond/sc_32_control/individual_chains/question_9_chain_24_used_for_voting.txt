Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. Hmm, symmetry can be a bit tricky, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. Wait, wait, what does C3H mean again? Oh right, C3H is a type of symmetry element. The 'C' stands for 'proper rotation', and the subscript number is the order. So C3 would mean a 120-degree rotation symmetry. The 'H' part is a bit confusing—oh, wait, no, I think I might be mixing up terms. Oh right, maybe the H is referring to horizontal mirror planes or something else. Wait, no, I think I was correct: C3H is a notation where H stands for horizontal. So, a molecule with a threefold rotation axis that is also horizontal. Or wait, maybe it's an improper rotation, like a rotation followed by a reflection. Oh wait, no, C3H might not be a standard notation. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with other notation. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to C3v symmetry, but no, the options don't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the point group symmetry. So if a molecule has a C3h symmetry, which is a point group. Let me think about the point groups. C3h is a type of point group. Point groups are determined by the symmetry elements present in the molecule. So C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and other elements like inversion if they exist.

Wait, but maybe the question is more straightforward. Let's think about each of the options.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo... something, and triphenylene... something. Let me go through each.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. So it's a trifuran system with triphenylene substituents? Trifuran is like three fused furan rings, I think. The numbering might indicate substitution points. The molecule probably has a lot of symmetry due to the substituents. If it's triphenylene, which is a symmetric structure, perhaps with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically around a core, then maybe this molecule has a threefold rotation axis.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Another fused ring system. Benzo groups attached to a trifuran. So maybe it's a benzene ring fused to a trifuran. The benzo part would add more complexity, but I'm not sure about the symmetry.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure-wise, borate is [B(OCH2CH2CH3)3]- but wait, triisopropyl borate is (i-PrO)3B. The structure is a trigonal planar arrangement around boron, with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl is a symmetric group. So the molecule should have a threefold rotation axis because all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically. So the point group would be D3h perhaps? Or C3v? Wait, the molecule is planar, but the substituents are bulky. Wait, actually, the structure of triisopropyl borate is trigonal pyramidal? No, wait, boron is in the center with three oxygen atoms connected to it. Each isopropyl group is O connected to B. So it's a trigonal planar arrangement. So if the molecule is trigonal planar, the point group is D3h. D3h has a C3 axis. So the presence of a C3 axis would mean that it has at least C3 symmetry. So this might be a candidate.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I believe. Its structure is a norbornane-like structure, but with a bridge. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Quinuclidine is similar but with a nitrogen. Let me think about its symmetry. Quinuclidine has a bridge, so it's a bicyclic system. The molecule is symmetric in some way. I think it has a C2 axis because it's a bridge structure. Wait, no, perhaps a higher symmetry. Wait, quinuclidine has a three-membered bridge? No, wait, the structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, quinuclidine is a molecule with seven-membered ring, but that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure. Quinuclidine has a central nitrogen connected to two bridgeheads and two other carbons, making a seven-membered ring? No, that's not right. Wait, no, quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene, but with a ring-opening or something. Alternatively, it's a bicyclic structure with three bridges. Wait, I think quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, but with a substituent. But regardless, the symmetry—does it have a threefold axis? I'm not sure. I think quinuclidine has a C3 axis. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chair-like structure, but then probably only C2 symmetry. I'm a bit unsure here.

Wait, the question is about C3H symmetry. So perhaps the molecule has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's just a threefold axis, since 'H' may refer to horizontal. Wait, perhaps the 'H' in C3H refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's in the C3h point group.

Now, evaluating each option:

Option C: triisopropyl borate. The molecule has three identical substituents arranged around a central atom (B). So yes, it has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's see. The molecule is planar? No, because each isopropyl group is a three-dimensional structure. Wait, the molecule as a whole is trigonal planar? No, because the isopropyl groups have their own three-dimensional arrangement. So the molecule is not planar. So would it have a horizontal mirror plane? Alternatively, perhaps it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, triisopropyl borate has three isopropyl groups attached to B. The structure is symmetric, so any plane that passes through the B atom and bisects two isopropyl groups would be a mirror plane. Wait, but the question is about a horizontal plane. If the molecule is flat, then a horizontal plane would be possible, but if it's more three-dimensional, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric in such a way that a C3 axis exists, so it definitely has C3 symmetry.

But the question is about C3H symmetry, which includes a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would need to have both. Alternatively, if C3H is just a threefold axis, then any of the C3-symmetric molecules would qualify. I might be getting the notation wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different notation where C3H refers to a threefold axis in a plane (like in a trigonal planar molecule).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to determine which of the options has a threefold axis.

Triisopropyl borate definitely has a threefold rotation axis (C3). Quinuclidine—does it have a C3? I think quinuclidine has a C2 axis. Because the structure is symmetric across two positions, perhaps. Benzo... I'm not sure about that one. The third option is a more complex bicyclic structure, but if it's a triphenylene attached to a trifuran, maybe it's symmetric in a way that gives a threefold symmetry.

Wait, let's think about each structure.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, the benzo group is fused to a trifuran. So benzo would add three substituents. The molecule would have a certain symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that allows 120-degree rotation, then it would have C3. Alternatively, maybe it's more of a D3h symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. So, the substituents are phenyl groups. If they are arranged symmetrically, that might imply a threefold axis. For example, if the three phenyl groups are placed at 120-degree positions around the trifuran, then the molecule would have a C3 axis.

Triisopropyl borate definitely has a C3 axis because all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically around the central atom. So option C would have C3 symmetry, so it would match the question.

But wait, the question is about C3H symmetry. So I need to check if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane as well.

In triisopropyl borate, the molecule has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron. Does that imply a horizontal mirror plane? Well, in trigonal planar, there are three mirror planes, each passing through a bond and the center. So for each substituent, there's a mirror plane. So, yes, but a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the point group. For a molecule with a C3 axis and three mirror planes, the point group is D3h. So D3h includes a C3 axis, a σh (horizontal mirror plane), and others. So if the molecule is in D3h, then it definitely has C3 symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.

So triisopropyl borate likely has a D3h symmetry, which includes C3 and σh. So it would have C3H symmetry. So option C would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let's reevaluate the other options. Triphenyleno... option A. The triphenyleno group is a three-phenyl substituent, perhaps arranged symmetrically. So if the substituents are arranged in a threefold symmetric fashion, then the molecule would have a C3 axis. But would it also have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenyleno group is arranged in a way that gives a C3 axis, but without a mirror plane. For example, if the molecule is chiral, but that's not the case here, as the substituents are symmetric.

Wait, the three phenyl groups in triphenyleno would be arranged symmetrically, so the molecule would have a threefold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then yes. But if it's not, then maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't planar, so the horizontal mirror plane isn't present.

So perhaps option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but let's think about the other options.

Option D: quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a bridge structure. Let me imagine it. It's a bicyclic structure, maybe with a bridge on either side, making it similar to adamantane but with a nitrogen. Wait, no, adamantane has a diamondoid structure. Quinuclidine's structure is a bridge bicyclo structure where the nitrogen is in a position that the molecule has a threefold axis. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine is a chair-like structure, but I think that's for different compounds.

Alternatively, quinuclidine is a molecule that has a three-membered ring, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's a seven-membered ring? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known for having a threefold symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate is definitely symmetric because all three substituents are the same, arranged symmetrically.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I think has a C2 axis because of its bridge structure. Because the two substituents on either side of the bridge would allow for a 180-degree rotation symmetry, but perhaps not 120.

The other two options, B and A, are more complex fused ring systems. Benzo... I'm not certain, but the triphenyleno group could have a threefold symmetry.

Wait, the question is about C3H symmetry, which is a point group. So if a molecule is in the C3h point group, then it has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So let's think about each option's point group.

Option C: triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, so it's in the D3h point group. D3h has a C3 axis, a σh, and others. So yes, it has C3H symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine—what's its point group? Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure is symmetric, but perhaps only has a C2 axis. So point group C2v or something else, but not C3h.

Option B: benzo... fused with trifuran. The benzo group is a benzene ring, which is symmetric. But when fused to a trifuran, the symmetry could be lower. Maybe the molecule has a C2 axis, but not a threefold.

Option A: triphenyleno... the triphenyleno group would have three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically. So the core would have a threefold axis, and the entire molecule would have a threefold rotation symmetry. Additionally, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane exists. So the point group would be D3h, same as option C.

Wait, but how to decide between options A and C?

The question lists four options, and the choices are A, B, C, D. So the options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

The question asks which has C3H symmetry.

If both options A and C have C3H symmetry, but the question only allows one correct answer, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them has it.

But wait, let me think about the actual structures.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, so the point group is D3h. So yes, it has a C3 axis and a σh.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran... So the core is a trifuran, with three phenyl groups attached. If the phenyl groups are at positions that are 120 degrees apart, then the molecule has a threefold axis. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is planar, then a σh would exist. So the point group would be D3h.

Wait, but the question is which molecule has C3H symmetry, which I think refers to the point group C3h. So is D3h considered as having C3H symmetry? Because D3h has a C3 axis and a σh plane, so it does have C3H elements.

If that's the case, both option A and C would have C3H symmetry. But the options are A, B, C, D. No, wait, the given options are four, and each option is a specific compound. The question is which has C3H.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the point groups. Let me clarify.

The point group C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It doesn't have any other symmetry elements. Whereas D3h has a C3 axis, a σh, and other elements (like three vertical mirror planes and inversion). So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it definitely has C3H symmetry.

So, triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3H. So option C would have C3H.

What about option A? Its structure is a trifuran with three phenyl groups. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would have a threefold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's imagine the structure. The trifuran is a five-membered ring, but with three phenyl groups attached. If the phenyl groups are arranged in a trigonal manner around the trifuran, then the molecule would be planar and have a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, it would have C3H symmetry, so point group D3h.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the structure of option A. Alternatively, perhaps the trifuran part is a three-fused ring system that's planar, allowing for a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would have both C3 and σh.

In that case, both option A and C would have C3H symmetry. But the options include only one correct answer.

Looking back at the question, the options are:

A) triphenyleno...

B) benzo...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, the correct answer must be among these.

Wait, perhaps the other options don't have C3H symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine, which I think has a C2 axis. So no C3.

Option B: benzo... I think the benzo group would add some substituents that make the symmetry lower.

So perhaps the correct answers are A and C. But the four options are given as four distinct molecules, only one of which is correct.

Wait, the question is, which of the following molecules has C3H symmetry.

Looking up:

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a known compound with D3h symmetry. Because it's trigonal planar with three identical groups, it has a C3 axis and three mirror planes, and a σh plane. So yes, it has C3H.

What about the other option, the triphenyleno...? Let me think about the structure. The molecule probably has three phenyl groups attached to a central ring system. If the central structure is symmetric, it would have a threefold axis. But whether it has a horizontal mirror plane depends on the planarity of the molecule. If the central ring is planar, then the mirror plane exists. So if the molecule is planar, then yes.

So both options A and C are possible. But the options are listed as four, and the choices are A, B, C, D. So the answer must be one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual structures of these molecules.

Triisopropyl borate: yes, as discussed, has D3h symmetry.

Now, looking at option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

The structure is a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with triphenylene substituents. Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule itself, a tricyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way. So attaching three triphenylene groups symmetrically around a core would lead to a molecule with a threefold axis. Moreover, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane exists, giving C3H symmetry.

Wait, but trifuran is a five-membered ring? Or is it a fused system of three furans? Hmm. Wait, trifuran is a fused system of three furan rings, arranged in a way that forms a nine-membered ring? Or maybe it's a tricyclic system. Regardless, the substituents are attached in a symmetric fashion, leading to a threefold axis.

So, perhaps both option A and C have C3H symmetry, but since the options list four, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them actually has a threefold symmetry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry (i.e., inversion). If the molecule has a center of inversion, then it would belong to a different point group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the options.

The options given are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I think triisopropyl borate (option C) is definitely a good candidate because of its trigonal symmetry, so it has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So C3H symmetry.

What about the others?

Benzo... option B: the benzo group is fused to the trifuran. The substituents would not be symmetric enough for a threefold axis.

Triphenyleno... option A: if the substituents are symmetric, then yes, but I'm not sure if the entire molecule is planar, which is necessary for the horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule in option A is non-planar. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a three-dimensional way, the molecule might not be planar, thus lacking the horizontal mirror plane. Hence, it would have C3 but not σh, so not C3H.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's core is non-planar. So without a horizontal mirror plane, it wouldn't have C3H symmetry.

In that case, only option C has C3H.

So the answer would be option C: triisopropyl borate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C3H symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C3H symmetry** refers to the presence of a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). This symmetry is characteristic of the point group **C3h**.

---

### Option A: **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three triphenylene substituents. 
- The triphenylene groups are symmetrically arranged, which suggests the presence of a **C3 axis**.
- However, the molecule's overall planarity is uncertain. If it is non-planar, it would lack a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**, and thus not exhibit **C3H symmetry**.

---

### Option B: **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule features a benzo group fused to a trifuran system.

- Therefore, this molecule does not exhibit **C3H symmetry**.

---

### Option C: **tripisopropyl borate**
- This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups, arranged in a trigonal planar geometry.
- The molecule has a **C3 axis** due to the symmetric arrangement of the substituents.
- Additionally, the molecule is planar, which means it also has a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**.
- Thus, this molecule exhibits **C3H symmetry** and belongs to the **D3h point group**, which includes both **C3** and **σh**.

---

### Option D: **quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. 
- Its symmetry is limited to a **C2 axis**, as the molecule does not have a threefold rotation axis (C3) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh). 
- Therefore, it does not exhibit **C3H symmetry**.

---

### Conclusion:
Among the given options, **tripisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that exhibits **C3H symmetry**, as it has both a **C3 axis** and a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**. 

**Answer: C**
