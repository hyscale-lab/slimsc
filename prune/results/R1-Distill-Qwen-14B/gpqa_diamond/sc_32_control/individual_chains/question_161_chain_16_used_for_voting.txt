Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Hmm, let me read it again.

Mike designed a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. His goal was to minimize gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy. But even in that vacuum, some gas particles were present, detected by a mass spectrometer. He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1 based on factors like volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then, when he started the electron beam, he noticed something about the mean free path. It changed from λ1 to λ2. The temperature stayed the same. So the question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Wait, what's the mean free path? Oh, right. Mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Another formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * p), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another formula I remember is the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure. But wait, in a vacuum, pressure is low, so mean free path is longer. Oh wait, but when the electron beam is on, does that affect the gas? Maybe the gas in the chamber interacts with the electrons.

Wait, the initial mean free path λ1 is calculated under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. But when the electron beam is active, perhaps the gas molecules are ionized or charged. Because when the beam hits them, electrons can be knocked off, making the gas ions. Or maybe the gas molecules become charged due to the beam.

Why does that matter? Well, charged particles interact more strongly with each other and with the electron beam. So if the gas molecules are ionized, their cross-section for scattering electrons would increase. Or perhaps their mean free path changes because they are now charged and can stick to the walls or other surfaces more easily.

Wait, but the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding. If the gas is ionized, maybe the collisions happen more frequently because the ions have more interactions. Or perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment. Hmm.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might get excited or ionized. That could change their behavior. For example, if the gas molecules are ionized, they might have a different effective cross-section for scattering electrons. But wait, the mean free path in this case is about collisions between gas molecules themselves, right? Or is it about collisions with the electron beam?

Wait, no. The mean free path for gas molecules in the chamber is determined by their collisions with each other. When the electron beam is off, the gas molecules have a certain λ1. But when the beam is on, perhaps the gas is ionized, leading to more frequent collisions between ions and gas molecules, thereby changing their mean free path.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is active, it could cause gas molecules to be removed more quickly. For example, if the gas is charged, it might be more easily pumped out of the chamber. So the effective pressure inside might change.

Wait, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So the temperature didn't change, but perhaps the presence of the beam affects the gas.

Wait, perhaps the beam causes the gas to become ionized, which affects the mean free path. Let me think. The mean free path equation is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density, and σ is the collision cross-section.

If the gas is ionized, the cross-section σ might change. For example, ions have a larger effective size because they have a charge, so they might have a larger σ. That would make λ smaller because λ is inversely proportional to σ.

So if σ increases, λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1. Because when the beam is on, the gas is ionized, σ increases, so λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So that would be the conclusion.

Wait, but another angle: When the electron beam is on, it's possible that it causes gas molecules to be removed more effectively, perhaps by pumping them out more quickly. That would lower the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. Because lower pressure (n is lower) → λ increases.

Wait, but the problem states that the mean free path is determined by Mike, and that the pressure is the same when the beam is on. So the pressure didn't change, because the vacuum pumps are maintaining the ultra-high vacuum.

Wait, but perhaps the electron beam interacts with the gas, causing more frequent collisions. For example, electrons from the beam could cause gas molecules to lose or gain electrons (ionization), which affects their cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam introduces additional factors, like photoelectric effect or others, that cause gas molecules to stick to the walls or other parts, effectively reducing their number in the compartment, thus increasing the mean free path. But in the problem, Mike saw λ2, which is no longer λ1. So if λ2 is different, what's the reason?

Wait, but the initial mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the existing conditions. But when the beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure is the same, but the effective cross-section changes, leading to a different λ.

So if the beam causes ionization, the cross-section σ increases, so λ decreases. Thus, λ2 < λ1. So option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas molecules to move faster, but the temperature is the same, so thermal velocity doesn't change. So that might not affect the mean free path, which depends on n and σ.

Wait, if the temperature is the same, the average velocity of the gas molecules doesn't change. So the only change is in the collision cross-section σ. If σ increases, λ decreases.

So the answer would be λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

The mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules in a vacuum is determined by factors such as the number density of the gas (n), the collision cross-section (σ), and is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot \sigma}
\]

In the scenario described, Mike initially calculates the mean free path as \( \lambda_1 \) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10\(^{-9}\) Torr), where the temperature remains constant. However, when the electron beam is activated, the mean free path changes to \( \lambda_2 \). The key difference lies in the interaction of the gas molecules with the electron beam.

When the electron beam is active, it can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective collision cross-section (\( \sigma \)) of the gas molecules due to their charged state. This increase in \( \sigma \) leads to more frequent collisions between gas molecules, thereby reducing the mean free path. Since \( \lambda \) is inversely proportional to \( \sigma \), the MFP decreases when \( \sigma \) increases. Therefore, \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \cdot \lambda_1 \))**: This would imply an increase in the mean free path, which contradicts the fact that ionization reduces \( \lambda \).
- **Option B (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \))**: This suggests no change in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the observed discrepancy due to the electron beam.
- **Option D (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \cdot \lambda_1 \))**: This implies an increase in \( \lambda_2 \), which is also inconsistent with the ionization effect.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \), as the ionization of gas molecules by the electron beam increases the collision cross-section, reducing the mean free path.
