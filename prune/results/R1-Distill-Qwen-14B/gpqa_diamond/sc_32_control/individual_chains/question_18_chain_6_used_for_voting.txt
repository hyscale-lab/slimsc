Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I don't think the masses directly affect the elemental ratios, so maybe I can ignore them for this calculation. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms between the two stars' photospheres.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. Let's list them out:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Right. Now, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. The ratio would be (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

But how do I get n_Si for each star? Well, I think I need to relate it to the other elements given.

Let's start with Star_1. The [Fe/H] is 0, which means the iron abundance is the same as the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe,1 / nH,1) - log(nFe☉ / nH☉) ) = 0 → log(nFe,1 / nH,1) = log(nFe☉ / nH☉) → nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe☉ / nH☉.

Wait, the sun's nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). So nFe,1 = (nFe☉ / nH☉) * nH,1. But for Star_1, the ratio [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex.

[Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi☉/nFe☉) ) = 0.3. So log(nSi,1 / nFe,1) = 0.3 + log(nSi☉/nFe☉).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The abundance ratio [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX☉/nY☉). So for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, that means:

log(nSi,1 / nFe,1) = log(nSi☉ / nFe☉) ) + 0.3.

Hmm, okay. So nSi,1 / nFe,1 = 10^(log(nSi☉/nFe☉) + 0.3).

Wait, but I know nFe,1 is the same as the Sun's because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe,1 = nFe☉. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe☉/nH☉) ) =0 → nFe/nH = nFe☉/nH☉ → so nFe is proportional to nH for Star_1.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of the Sun's values.

For Star_1:

Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, nFe,1 = nFe☉ * (nH,1 / nH☉).

Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH)/(nFe☉/nH☉) → which is 0, so nFe/nH = nFe☉/nH☉ → nFe = (nFe☉ / nH☉) * nH,1.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it. Maybe another way: The solar abundance ratios are given, so let's use them as a reference.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means the abundance of Si relative to Fe is higher by 0.3 dex compared to the Sun.

The Sun's [Si/Fe] would be log(nSi☉/nFe☉) because [X/Y]_☉ = log(nX☉/nY☉) - log(nX☉/nY☉) ) = 0? Wait, no, no. Wait, the [X/Y] notation is relative to the Sun. So normally, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX☉/nY☉) ). So if I have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, that means:

log(nSi,1/nFe,1) = log(nSi☉/nFe☉) + 0.3.

So, nSi,1 / nFe,1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi☉/nFe☉).

But wait, nFe,1 is nFe☉ * (nH,1 / nH☉ ), because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe☉/nH☉) ) = 0 → nFe/nH = nFe☉/nH☉ → nFe = (nFe☉/nH☉) * nH.

So nFe,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) * nH,1.

So nSi,1 = (nSi☉/nFe☉) * 10^0.3 * nFe,1.

Substituting nFe,1: nSi,1 = (nSi☉/nFe☉) * 10^0.3 * (nFe☉/nH☉) * nH,1.

Simplify: nSi,1 = (nSi☉ * nFe☉ * 10^0.3) / (nFe☉ * nH☉) ) * nH,1 → (nSi☉ * 10^0.3) / nH☉ ) * nH,1.

But the Sun's ratio is nFe☉/nH☉ = 10^(-4.5), and nSi☉/nH☉ can be found from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about the Sun's Si abundance? Hmm, it's not directly given. Oh wait, maybe I can calculate it. Because [Mg/Si] for Star_2 is given, but for the Sun, I don't have [Mg/Si]. Wait, maybe for the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero? Not necessarily, but perhaps in the solar photosphere, [Mg/Si] is a known value, but since it's not given, maybe the problem assumes that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero? Or that the problem doesn't require it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see.

Wait, maybe to find nSi,1, I need to find it in terms of nH, and then for Star_2, find nSi,2 in terms of their nH, and then take the ratio.

So for Star_1:

nFe,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) * nH,1.

Similarly, nSi,1 = (nSi☉/nH☉) * nH,1 * 10^([Si/Fe]_1).

Wait, no. Because [Si/Fe] is a ratio relative to Fe. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi☉/nFe☉) ) = 0.3 → log(nSi,1/nFe,1) = log(nSi☉/nFe☉) +0.3 → nSi,1 = nFe,1 * (nSi☉/nFe☉) * 10^0.3.

But nFe,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) * nH,1 → nFe,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) * nH,1.

So substituting, nSi,1 = (nFe,1) * (nSi☉/nFe☉) * 10^0.3 → [ (nFe☉/nH☉) * nH,1 ] * (nSi☉/nFe☉ ) *10^0.3 → (nSi☉/nH☉) * nH,1 * 10^0.3.

Which is (nSi☉/nH☉) * 10^0.3 * nH,1.

Similarly, the Sun's nSi/nH can be found from the solar abundance. Wait, but the solar abundances given are for Fe and Mg. Hmm, perhaps I need to make some assumption about the solar Si abundance.

Wait, but according to the solar photospheric composition provided:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, 12+log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

But what about Si? I don't have that. Oh, wait, maybe the problem doesn't require me to calculate the absolute number, but only the ratio between the two stars.

So perhaps I can express nSi,1 and nSi,2 in terms of nH,1 and nH,2, respectively, and then take the ratio nSi,1 /nSi,2.

Let me try that.

For Star_1:

nSi,1 = (nFe,1) * (nSi☉/nFe☉) *10^0.3.

But nFe,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) *nH,1.

So nSi,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) *nH,1 * (nSi☉/nFe☉) *10^0.3 → (nSi☉/nH☉) *nH,1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, I need to find nSi,2.

Looking at Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg,2/nSi,2) = log(nMg☉/nSi☉) + 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg,2/nH,2) = log(nMg☉/nH☉) → nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2.

So from [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg,2/nH,2) / (nSi,2/nH,2) ) = log(nMg☉/nH☉) +0.3 → log( (nMg,2 /nSi,2) ) = log(nMg☉/nH☉) +0.3 - log(nH,2/nH,2?) Wait, no.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg,2 /nSi,2) - log(nMg☉/nSi☉) ) =0.3 → log(nMg,2/nSi,2) = log(nMg☉/nSi☉) + 0.3.

But I can also express nMg,2 as (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 → because [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

So substituting:

log( ( (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 ) / nSi,2 ) ) = log(nMg☉/nSi☉) + 0.3.

Let me write this as:

log( (nMg☉ nH,2) / (nH☉ nSi,2) ) = log(nMg☉/nSi☉) + 0.3.

Exponentiating both sides:

( nMg☉ nH,2 ) / (nH☉ nSi,2 ) ) = 10^(log(nMg☉/nSi☉) + 0.3 ) ) → (nMg☉ nH,2) / (nH☉ nSi,2 ) ) = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3.

Simplifying:

(nH,2) / (nH☉ nSi,2 ) ) = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3 / nMg☉ → [ (nH,2) / nH☉ ) ] / nSi,2 = 10^0.3 / (nSi☉) * nMg☉ ? Wait, perhaps I should rearrange terms.

Wait, let me write it as:

(nMg☉ * nH,2 ) / (nH☉ * nSi,2 ) ) = (nMg☉ / nSi☉ ) * 10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by (nH☉ * nSi,2) / nMg☉):

nH,2 = (nH☉ * nSi,2 / nMg☉ ) ) * (nMg☉ / nSi☉ ) * 10^0.3 ) → Wait, perhaps not. Let's try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps solve for nSi,2.

Let me rearrange the equation:

nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, we have nMg,2 /nSi,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3.

Substituting nMg,2:

(nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 ) / nSi,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by nSi,2:

(nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉ ) *10^0.3 * nSi,2.

Divide both sides by (nMg☉/nH☉):

nH,2 = (nMg☉/(nH☉ )) * (nMg☉/nSi☉ ) *10^0.3 * (nSi,2 / nMg☉ ) ? Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, let's write it as:

nSi,2 = (nMg,2 / ( (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3 )) → nSi,2 = nMg,2 * (nSi☉/(nMg☉)) *10^(-0.3).

But nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 → substituting:

nSi,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉ *nH,2 ) * (nSi☉/nMg☉) *10^(-0.3) → nSi,2 = (nH,2) * (nSi☉/nH☉ ) *10^(-0.3).

Wait, that's similar to the expression for nSi,1.

Wait, for Star_1: nSi,1 = (nSi☉/nH☉) *nH,1 *10^0.3.

And for Star_2: nSi,2 = (nSi☉/nH☉) *nH,2 *10^(-0.3).

So the ratio nSi,1 / nSi,2 = [ (nSi☉/nH☉) *nH,1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nSi☉/nH☉) *nH,2 *10^(-0.3) ].

Simplify: the (nSi☉/nH☉) terms cancel out. So:

nSi,1/nSi,2 = (nH,1 / nH,2 ) * 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) ) → (nH,1/nH,2) *10^(0.6).

Hmm, okay. Now, what's nH,1 and nH,2? Are these the total hydrogen numbers in each star?

Wait, but we don't have information about the total hydrogen in each star. Unless the problem assumes that the total hydrogen is the same, but that's not stated.

Wait, the problem gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star, but for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun, but doesn't necessarily mean H is the same. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg abundance is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but perhaps we can find nH,1 and nH,2 in terms of their respective stars' abundances.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe,1/nH,1) - log(nFe☉/nH☉) =0 → nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe☉/nH☉ → So nH,1 = nFe,1 * (nH☉ / nFe☉).

But nFe,1 is the same as nFe☉ times some factor? Wait no, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → nFe,1 = nFe☉ * (nH,1 / nH☉) → because nFe,1 /nH,1 = nFe☉/nH☉ → nFe,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) nH,1.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, maybe the total number of atoms, or the total H, is what's needed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: for the ratio nH,1/nH,2.

Wait, I don't think the problem gives any data about the overall metallicity or H abundance beyond what's given in the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. So perhaps the ratio depends only on the 10^(0.6) term, but that can't be right because that would give a ratio of about 3.98 (since 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98). So that's option A) ~3.9.

But wait, I thought the ratio would be (nH,1 /nH,2) *10^(0.6). But without knowing nH,1 and nH,2, we can't compute the ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance (nH) is the same in both stars. But that's not stated, so I can't assume that.

Wait, but if I think about the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], which are both 0 for each star respectively.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe,1 = (nFe☉/nH☉) *nH,1.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2.

But I don't have any other information about H in the stars.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the total number of hydrogen atoms (nH) is the same in both stars. But I'm not sure if that's valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH,1/nH,2 is 1, which would make the ratio nSi,1/nSi,2 =10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, why would nH,1 and nH,2 be the same? They are different stars, possibly with different metallicities, so their H abundance might not be the same.

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, which means that the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So if the Sun has a certain nFe/nH, Star_1 has the same ratio. So nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe☉/nH☉.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → nMg,2/nH,2 =nMg☉/nH☉.

But how does that affect nH,1 and nH,2?

Wait, perhaps nH is not the same in each star. Without knowing the total density or another parameter, I can't find the ratio of nH,1 to nH,2.

So I might be stuck here. Wait, perhaps I need to find another way. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Since the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, perhaps it's the ratio relative to hydrogen. Because without knowing the absolute number of H, I can't get the absolute number of Si, but perhaps the ratio Si/H would be determined, and then compare the two stars' [Si/H] abundances.

Wait, let's think about that.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 +0 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 -0.3 = -0.3.

Wait, wait. How does that work? Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) – log(nX☉/nY☉). So [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 is log(nSi/nH) – log(nSi☉/nH☉). And [Mg/H]_2 is zero, so log(nMg/nH) – log(nMg☉/nH☉)=0 → log(nMg/nH) = log(nMg☉/nH☉) → nMg/nH = nMg☉/nH☉ → So nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg,2/nSi,2) – log(nMg☉/nSi☉) =0.3 → log( (nMg,2/nSi,2) ) = log(nMg☉/nSi☉) +0.3 → nMg,2/nSi,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3.

So nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3 *nSi,2.

But from [Mg/H]_2=0, nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2.

So (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3 *nSi,2 → rearranged:

nH,2 = (nMg☉ /nH☉ ) * (nSi☉ /nMg☉ ) *10^0.3 *nSi,2 → nH,2 = (nSi☉ /nH☉ ) *10^0.3 *nSi,2.

So nSi,2 = (nH,2 *nH☉ )/(nSi☉ *10^0.3 ).

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 and [Fe/H]=0.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0 =0.3.

Which means log(nSi,1/nH,1 ) – log(nSi☉/nH☉ )=0.3 → nSi,1/nH,1 = (nSi☉/nH☉) *10^0.3 → nSi,1 = (nSi☉/nH☉) *10^0.3 *nH,1.

Therefore, the ratio of nSi,1/nSi,2 = [ (nSi☉/nH☉) *10^0.3 *nH,1 ] / [ (nH,2 *nH☉ )/(nSi☉ *10^0.3 ) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(numerator) = (nSi☉/nH☉) *10^0.3 *nH,1.

(denominator) = (nH,2 *nH☉ )/(nSi☉ *10^0.3 ) ).

So the ratio becomes:

[ (nSi☉/nH☉) *10^0.3 *nH,1 ] * [ (nSi☉ *10^0.3 ) / (nH,2 *nH☉ ) ) ].

Multiply the terms:

(nSi☉/nH☉) *10^0.3 *nH,1 *nSi☉ *10^0.3 / (nH,2 *nH☉ ).

Simplify the terms:

nSi☉^2 *10^(0.3+0.3) * nH,1 / (nH,2 *nH☉^2 ).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me write it as:

(nSi☉^2 * 10^0.6 * nH,1 ) / (nH,2 *nH☉^2 )

Hmm, but without knowing the ratio nH,1 /nH,2, I can't proceed further.

Wait, but perhaps there is another way. Let's think about the Sun's abundances. The Sun has nFe/nH =1e-4.5 and nMg/nH=1e-5.

I don't have the Sun's nSi/nH, but perhaps I can find it.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/Si] can be found from the solar [Fe/Si] value, but I don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio nSi,1/nSi,2 =10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

Since [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, so the answer is option A.

But earlier, that seems to ignore the fact that the ratios depend on nH, but perhaps the problem treats [X/H] as a logarithm, which is the case. So, the ratio of the abundances would be 10^{([X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2)}.

Because, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) – log(nX☉/nH☉).

So, the ratio of nX,1 /nX,2 = 10^{ [X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2 }.

Wait, let me think. Let [X/H]_1 = a, [X/H]_2 = b.

Then, log(nX,1/nH,1) = a + log(nX☉/nH☉).

Similarly, log(nX,2/nH,2) = b + log(nX☉/nH☉).

The ratio (nX,1/nX,2) = [ (nX,1/nH,1) / (nX,2/nH,2) ) ] * (nH,2 /nH,1).

Which is [10^{a} /10^{b} ] * (nH,2/nH,1).

But without knowing nH,2/nH,1, I can't find the ratio. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, but if I compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then the ratio would be (nSi,1 /nH,1) / (nSi,2 /nH,2) ) = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

But to find (nSi,1/nSi,2 ), I'd need to know (nH,2/nH,1) as well.

Wait, unless the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio simply 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

But the problem doesn't state that, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 +0 =0.3.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 * [other steps?]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → which is log(nMg,2/nSi,2) – log(nMg☉/nSi☉ ) =0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg,2/nH,2) – log(nMg☉/nH☉ )=0 → nMg,2/nH,2 =nMg☉/nH☉.

Let me compute [Si/H]_2.

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi,2/nH,2) – log(nSi☉/nH☉).

I need to find log(nSi,2/nH,2).

From [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, I have nMg,2/nSi,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3.

But nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 → substituting:

(nMg☉/nH☉ *nH,2 ) /nSi,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3 → nH,2 /nSi,2 = (nH☉ *nMg☉ *nSi☉ )/(nMg☉ *nH☉ ) ) *10^0.3 → Hmm, no. Let me rearrange.

nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2.

So putting that into [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

[ (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 ] / nSi,2 = (nMg☉/nSi☉) *10^0.3 → nH,2 /nSi,2 = (nH☉ *nMg☉ *nSi☉ ) / (nMg☉ *nH☉ ) ) *10^0.3 → Wait, perhaps better to solve for nSi,2.

nSi,2 = (nMg,2 *nSi☉ ) / (nMg☉ * 10^0.3 ) → but nMg,2 = (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 → so:

nSi,2 = [ (nMg☉/nH☉) *nH,2 ) *nSi☉ ] / (nMg☉ *10^0.3 ) → nSi,2 = (nH,2 *nSi☉ ) / (nH☉ *10^0.3 ) → nSi,2 = (nSi☉ /nH☉ ) *nH,2 *10^(-0.3).

So, nSi,2/nH,2 = (nSi☉/nH☉ ) *10^(-0.3).

So, [Si/H]_2 = log( nSi,2/nH,2 ) - log(nSi☉/nH☉ ) → log( (nSi☉/nH☉ ) *10^(-0.3) ) - log(nSi☉/nH☉ ) → log( (nSi☉/nH☉ ) ) + log(10^(-0.3)) ) - log(nSi☉/nH☉ ) → log(10^-0.3 ) → which is -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

So the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 → 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But wait, the ratio is (nSi,1/nH,1 ) / (nSi,2/nH,2 ) ) → 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } → 10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2: n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

But if I have (nSi,1 /nH,1 ) / (nSi,2/nH,2 ) ) =10^0.6 → which is the same as (nSi,1/nSi,2 ) * (nH,2 /nH,1 ) ) =10^0.6.

So unless I know the ratio of nH,2 /nH,1, I can't find nSi,1/nSi,2.

But I don't think the problem gives that information. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let me think differently. Since Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0 → nFe,1 =nFe☉ * (nH,1 /nH☉).

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 →nMg,2 =nMg☉ * (nH,2 /nH☉).

But I don't have any relation between nH,1 and nH,2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed such that the H abundance cancels out when taking the ratio. Let me go back to the expressions.

We have:

nSi,1 = (nSi☉/nH☉ ) *nH,1 *10^0.3.

nSi,2 = (nSi☉/nH☉ ) *nH,2 *10^(-0.3).

So the ratio nSi,1/nSi,2 = (nH,1 /nH,2 ) * (10^0.3 /10^-0.3 ) → (nH,1/nH,2 ) *10^0.6.

But without knowing nH,1/nH,2, I can't compute this.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that nH,1 =nH,2. If that's the case, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not certain if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio relative to the Sun's H.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star.

For Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi,1/nH,1 = (nSi☉/nH☉ ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → nSi,2 /nH,2 = (nSi☉/nH☉ ) *10^-0.3.

The ratio (nSi,1/nH,1 ) / (nSi,2/nH,2 ) ) =10^0.6 → which is about 3.98.

But the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Which is nSi,1 /nSi,2.

But that ratio is (nSi,1/nH,1 ) * (nH,2/nSi,2 ) → because nSi,1 = (nSi,1/nH,1 ) *nH,1 and nSi,2= (nSi,2/nH,2 ) *nH,2.

So the ratio is (nSi,1/nH,1 ) * (nH,2/(nSi,2/nH,2 )) ) → which is (nSi,1/nH,1 ) / (nSi,2/nH,2 ) ) * (nH,2 /nH,1 ) → which is 10^0.6 * (nH,2/nH,1 ).

But again, I don't have nH,2 /nH,1. So perhaps the only way this makes sense is if the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star, but the question specifies 'silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2', which would imply the ratio nSi,1/nSi,2, not considering H.

Wait, but the problem statement says, 'the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres'.

Ah, so it's nSi,1 /nSi,2.

But without knowing nH,1 and nH,2, I can't compute this. Unless the problem makes some assumption.

Wait, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars. If that's the case, then nH,1 =nH,2 → the ratio becomes 10^0.6≈3.98 → option A.

But the problem doesn't state that, but given the options, perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, and the ratio is 10^{0.6}.

So, the answer would be option A) ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the definitions of abundance ratios. The problem provides the following data:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \)
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \)

### Approach:
1. **Abundance Ratios**:
   - The abundance ratio \([X/Y]\) is defined as:
     \[
     [X/Y] = \log_{10}(n_X/n_Y) - \log_{10}(n_X^\odot/n_Y^\odot)
     \]
   - Using this definition, we compute the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio \([Si/H]\) for both stars.

2. **[Si/H] for Star_1**:
   - From \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), we find:
     \[
     [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
     \]

3. **[Si/H] for Star_2**:
   - From \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\) and \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), we find:
     \[
     [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3
     \]

4. **Ratio of Silicon Abundances**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
     \]
   - Substituting \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\):
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
     \]
   - Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately 3.98.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**. This corresponds to option **A**.
