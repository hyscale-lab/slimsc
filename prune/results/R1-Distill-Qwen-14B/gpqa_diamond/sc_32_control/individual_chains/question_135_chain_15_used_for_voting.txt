Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the decay products of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV. The options are different possible decay channels, and I need to pick the kinematically allowed ones at the lowest order.

Hmm, so first, I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is larger than twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of the parent particle.

So for X to decay into a pair of particles f and anti-f, the condition is m_X ≥ 2 m_f. Since X is 6 GeV, each fermion in the pair must be less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 6 = 2 * 3.

Wait, but wait. I'm mixing up units here. GeV is the unit for mass. So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion should have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

Now, I need to list all possible fermions (quarks and leptons) that have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Let's list the known elementary fermions and their masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e^-): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ^-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ^-): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV (but up and down are much lighter)
- Down (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Wait, so the up, down, strange, and charm quarks have masses under 3 GeV. Bottom and top are over.

So X can decay into any pair where each fermion is up, down, strange, charm, or any of the leptons (e, mu, tau). Because their masses are all under 3 GeV.

But wait, what about the tau? Its mass is around 1.777 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.554 GeV. Oh wait, X is 6 GeV, so 3.554 is less than 6. So tau can be a decay product.

Wait, let's compute 2*m_f for each:

- e: 2*0.0005 = 0.001 → way less than 6
- mu: 0.21 GeV → way less
- tau: about 3.55 GeV → 3.55 <6 → allowed
- u: 0.006 → allowed
- d: 0.008 → allowed
- s: ~0.19 → allowed
- c: ~3 → 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is exactly m_X/2. So 3 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

Wait, 2m_c would be 3 GeV, so yes, X can decay into c cbar. Because 3 ≤6.

But for tau: 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

So the possible fermions for decay pairs are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait but what about the bottom quark? mb is about 4.7 GeV. 2mb is 9.4 GeV, which is way larger than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

Same with top, but top is already way heavier. So no decay into t tbar.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ-

X → u ubar

X → d dbar

X → s sbar

X → c cbar

Wait, what about the charm quark? 2m_c is about 3 GeV, which is okay because 3 <6.

So the boson can decay into any of these pairs.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b has mass 4.7 GeV. 2mb is 9.4 GeV, which is more than X's mass (6 GeV). So decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So it includes c, which is allowed. So B includes c cbar, which is allowed. So let's see what's in option B. It says: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, etc.

So option B is X→ c cbar, s sbar, etc. So this seems correct.

Option C: includes t tbar, which is not allowed. Because 2mt is way over 6 GeV. So option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

So the correct options are the ones that include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but not b or t.

Looking again at the options:

Option B) X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d db, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait! The given Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X) ψ_f(y). So this is an interaction term. The ψ_f here is a fermion field. So the possible fermions that X can decay into are those that the Lagrangian allows. So if the interaction is written with ψ_f, it means the fermions that X couples to are the ones that are present in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So the Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) X ψ_f(y), assuming that the Yukawa term is the usual one. So the fermions that X couples to are all the ones that are in the theory.

Wait, but in reality, the Yukawa coupling would involve specific fermions. But the problem doesn't specify which fermions; it's more about the kinematics based on mass. Because the problem is about the decay, and the Lagrangian is just given as a general interaction.

Wait, actually, the fermion fields ψ_f(y) in the interaction term could be any fermions, but perhaps in the question's context, it's implied that X can interact with all possible fermions, unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." which suggests that X can interact with all possible fermions. So the question is purely about kinematics.

So, going back, the possible decay products are any fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So their pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ubar, d db, s sbar, c cbar.

So the correct decay options should include all these.

Looking again at the options, let's check each:

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d db, tau+, tau-, mu+, mu-, e+ e- → that's all the possible ones except for t and b. So option B is correct.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option B: "c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d db, tau+, tau-, mu+, mu-, e+ e-"

Yes. So that's all allowed.

So the answer is option B.

The question involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)), the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion. This ensures the energy is sufficient to produce the fermion-antifermion pair.

The fermion masses are as follows:

- **Leptons**:  
  - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)  

- **Quarks**:  
  - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)  

From these masses, the fermions with \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are:  
- \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), and \( c \bar{c} \).  

The fermions \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) are excluded because their masses exceed the threshold (\( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), both greater than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed.  
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed.  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
