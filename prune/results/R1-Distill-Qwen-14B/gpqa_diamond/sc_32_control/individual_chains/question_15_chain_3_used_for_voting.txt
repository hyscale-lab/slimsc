Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the question says both have the same mass. Oh right, mass is the same. But the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, P2 is 3*P1.

Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so their radii are same.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula P = R_p / (2R_s) * (a / sqrt(a² - R_s²)) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing some terms. Alternatively, I think the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)² divided by something else, but wait no, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, wait, let me get this right. The transit probability (p) is approximately equal to (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)), where a is the semi-major axis. Or is it the other way around? Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a * sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) ))? Hmm, maybe I should think about how the transit probability is calculated.

Alternatively, I recall that the transit probability, the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view, is given by the formula:

p = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a * sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2))) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a)) multiplied by something else. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability can be approximated as the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s) multiplied by the impact parameter divided by something. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it in terms of orbital geometry.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this happening is related to the relative sizes of the star and the planet's orbit. The probability is given by the formula:

p = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a / R_s)) )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the probability is (R_p / R_s) multiplied by the inverse of the semi-major axis over the star's radius, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the standard transit probability formula is:

p = (R_p + R_s) / (a) * (R_s / a) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2) ), but I'm not very confident about this.

Wait, another thought. The transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but that can't be correct because if the planet's orbit is much larger, the probability should be lower. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis. No, that would make it smaller when a is larger, which is correct because larger a implies less chance of alignment.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula:

p = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a / R_s)) ) ?

Wait, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which would make p = R_p / (a) * R_s / R_s = R_p / a. But that doesn't seem right because if a is larger, the probability would be lower, which makes sense, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the transit probability is (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which simplifies to R_p / a. But I'm not sure if this is the correct formula.

Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)² divided by the semi-major axis a, but that also doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a better way. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is the same as the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by (R_p / R_s). No, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I should consider the solid angle. The transit occurs when the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit circle.

Wait, no, because the orbital distance is much larger. So the area of the orbit is πa², and the area of the star's disk is πR_s². The ratio would be R_s²/a², but that's the fraction of the sky where the planet can transit. But that's just the geometric probability, which I think is (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, but that would be the probability that the planet's path is across the star. But we also need to consider the size of the planet. Because the planet's size must also block the light. So perhaps the transit probability is (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, but that's combining the geometric probability and the size of the planet. Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is p = (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a)^2.

Alternatively, maybe p = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbit's distance to the star's radius, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the formula is p = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) )) * (some other factors), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the orbital parameters. The probability is higher when the planet is closer to the star (small a) and when the star is larger (but in this problem, both stars have the same radius, so that's a wash). Also, a larger planet has a higher probability, but the question states that both planets have the same mass, but radius might not be the same. Wait, the question says "Earth-like planets" but doesn't specify their radii. Hmm, that complicates things. Because the transit probability depends on R_p, if they have the same mass but different radii, that would affect the probability. Wait, but the question doesn't say anything about their radii. It only gives information about their masses and the host stars' masses and radii.

Wait, the question says "two Earth-like planets", so perhaps we can assume they have similar radii, but without exact data, maybe the question expects us to ignore the planet size since it's the same for both.

Wait, the question says both have the same mass. So if they're Earth-like, same mass implies similar radii. So perhaps their R_p is the same. So the planet size factor is the same for both.

So, the transit probability would depend on the semi-major axis (a) and the star's radius (R_s). Since both stars have the same R_s, that term is same for both. So, the main variable is a.

But wait, the host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's host.

But how does the star's mass relate to the planet's semi-major axis? Because the planet's period is given, and we can use Kepler's third law to find the semi-major axis.

Ah, right! Kepler's third law relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis. The original form is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. So, for each planet, their semi-major axis can be determined based on their period and the mass of their host star.

So, let's compute a for each planet.

For Planet_1: period P1, host mass M1 = 2 * M2.

For Planet_2: period P2 = 3*P1, host mass M2.

So, let's write Kepler's third law as a^3 = (G(M) P² )/(4π²).

But since we're comparing a1 and a2, we can take the ratio.

Let me compute a1³ / a2³ = [ (G M1 P1²) / (4π²) ) ] / [ (G M2 P2²) / (4π²) ) ]

Simplify: a1³ / a2³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²)

Given that M1 = 2*M2, and P2 = 3*P1 → P2² = 9 P1².

So:

a1³ / a2³ = (2) * (P1²)/(9 P1²) ) = 2/(9) → 2/9.

Thus, a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its star. Because a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, since the transit probability depends on a, and the star's radius is same for both, which a is smaller, the transit probability is higher because a is smaller → R_s/a is larger → higher chance the planet's orbit is aligned to transit.

But wait, the transit probability formula, let's think again. Let's say that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a)². Because the geometric probability is (R_s / a)^2, multiplied by the planet's size factor (R_p / R_s), so p ∝ (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a)^2 = R_p * R_s / a².

Wait, but that would mean p ∝ R_p * R_s / a². Since R_p is same for both planets (assuming Earth-like, same mass → same radius), and R_s is same for both, then p is proportional to 1/a². So the planet with smaller a has a higher transit probability.

So a1 is smaller than a2 → 1/a1² is bigger than 1/a2² → p1 > p2.

So Planet_1 has higher transit probability.

But wait, I need to compute the exact factor.

We have a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^{1/3}.

So let's compute a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)) ) = (2^(1/3)) / ( (3^2)^(1/3) ) ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) = (2/3² )^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3), yes.

So, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^{1/3}.

We can compute (2/9)^{1/3} numerically. Let's see:

2^1/3 ≈ 1.26

9^1/3 ≈ 2.08

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 * a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to 1/a².

So p1/p2 = (a2/(a1))^2 = (1/(0.605))^2 ≈ (1.6529)^2 ≈ 2.732.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because p is proportional to R_p * R_s / a². Since R_p and R_s are same, p1/p2 = (a2² / a1²) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a1 = 0.605 a2 → a2/a1 = 1/0.605 ≈ 1.6529.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.6529)^2 ≈ 2.732. So p1 is about 2.73 times p2.

Wait, but that can't be correct because if a is smaller, the planet is closer, which should mean higher p. So p1 is higher than p2 by a factor of ~2.73.

But wait, looking back, the options are about which planet is preferred. The question says the researchers want to observe the one with higher probability. So if p1 is higher, they should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. Option C is 1.65 times.

Wait, but according to the calculation, p1/p2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1/0.605)^2 ≈ 2.73.

So option D states that Planet_1 has a ~2.7 times higher probability. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back.

The transit probability p is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (1/(a)) * (something else?) Wait, perhaps the formula is p = (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a)^2. So p = R_p R_s / a². Since R_p and R_s are same for both, p is inversely proportional to a².

So p1/p2 = (a2²)/(a1²) = (a2/a1)^2.

a2/a1 = (a2) / (0.605 a2) ) = 1/0.605 ≈ 1.6529.

So (1.6529)^2 = approx (1.65)^2 = 2.7225.

So yes, p1 is about 2.73 times p2.

Thus, Planet_1 has higher transit probability, and the factor is about 2.7, so option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( p \) is proportional to:

\[
p \propto \frac{R_p}{R_s} \cdot \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{R_p \cdot R_s}{a^2}
\]

Here, \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, we assume \( R_p \) is the same for both. Additionally, both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), so the transit probability depends only on the semi-major axis \( a \), with \( p \propto 1/a^2 \).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_s \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto \frac{P^2 \cdot M_s}{}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1's host star mass is \( M_{s1} = 2 \cdot M_{s2} \).
- Planet_2's orbital period is \( P_2 = 3 \cdot P_1 \).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{s1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot P_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot (3P_1)^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Thus:

\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605 \), we find:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a^2 \). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.605}\right)^2 \approx 1.6529^2 \approx 2.73
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. The correct option is:
