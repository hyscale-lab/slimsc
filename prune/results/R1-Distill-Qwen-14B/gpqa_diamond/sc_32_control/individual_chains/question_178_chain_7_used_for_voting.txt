Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangian and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question gives a Lagrangian term, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

So the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_μν is (i/2) [γ_mu, γ_nu]. Wait, I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric and related to the generators of Lorentz transformations or something like that.

First, I think I need to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian has mass dimension [L] = 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions, right? So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let's break down the terms. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F. So let me figure out the dimensions of each component.

What's the dimension of ψ? Fermion fields usually have a mass dimension of 3/2 in 4D. Because the action is dimensionless, the Lagrangian density has dimension 4, so each term should have dimension 4. So ψ is 3/2, ψ̄ is also 3/2.

What about σ_mu_nu? Well, σ is made from γ matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ has the same dimension as the product of gamma matrices, but since it's a commutator, maybe it's also dimensionless. Wait, no, the σ is a product of γ's and maybe some derivatives, but wait, no, σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. So σ_mu_nu is just a product of two gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless because gamma matrices are dimensionless.

Then, F_mu_nu is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each derivative has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. Because in 4D, A_mu has mass dimension 1. Let me confirm: the gauge field A has dimension 1 because the field strength F has dimension 2. Because F is like ∂A, so ∂ is dimension 1, A is dimension 1, so F would be dimension 2. Yeah, that makes sense.

So F^{mu nu} is a field strength tensor, which has dimension 2.

Now, putting it all together. The term is κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F.

Wait, no, wait—the term is ψ̄ σ_mu_nu ψ F^{mu nu}. So the structure is ψ̄ (σ · F)ψ? Or is it a product of σ and F?

Wait, no, the term is (σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}), so σ_{mu nu} is a tensor with two indices, and F^{mu nu} is also a tensor. So when you contract the indices, you get a scalar. So the term is ψ̄ ψ multiplied by σ·F, but more precisely, it's ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait no, actually, the term is (σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}), which is a Lorentz scalar. So the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ (σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}) ψ.

So, to compute the dimension, I need to compute each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3. Then σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless, F^{mu nu} is dimension 2. So σ F would have dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ (σ F) ψ is (3/2) + (2) + (3/2) = 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, wait, wait. Let me break it down again.

Wait, the full term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ multiplied by F^{mu nu}?

Wait, no. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ multiplied by F^{mu nu}, but with the indices contracted. So (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) F^{mu nu}.

Wait, but σ_{mu nu} is a tensor, and F^{mu nu} is another tensor. So when you multiply them, you're contracting on the mu and nu indices. So the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu} ψ. Hmm, maybe I should think of the product as (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) F^{mu nu} but that doesn't make much sense dimensionally.

Wait, perhaps I should treat the whole thing as (ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ) multiplied by F^{mu nu}. But then the contraction would be over mu and nu, so perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, maybe the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu} ψ, which is a Lorentz scalar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is ψ̄ (σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}) ψ. But sigma and F are both antisymmetric, so their product is a scalar. So the term is (ψ̄) (something) (ψ). Let me get the dimensions right.

ψ̄ has dim 3/2, ψ has dim 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ has dim 3.

The σ_{mu nu} F^{mu nu} term: σ is dimensionless, F is dimension 2. So σ F has dimension 2.

So the whole term is [ψ̄][σ F][ψ] = (3/2) + 2 + (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 makes 5. So the entire term is κ times something that has dimension 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term in the Lagrangian is κ (something with dim 5) = 4. So [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So looking at the options, that would be either A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable, all the interaction terms in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (in 4D), because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, wait, actually, the operators in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term's operator must have dimension <=4, but wait, wait, no. The term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so the operator must have dimension 4 minus the coupling's dimension.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each term in the Lagrangian. The term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ, which has dimension [L] = [κ] + [ψ̄ψ] + [σ F].

Wait, but we already found that [L] must be 4. So [κ] + [ψ̄ψ σ F] = 4. The [ψ̄ψ σ F] part: [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, [σ] is 0, [F] is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. So [L] = [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So yes, that's correct.

Now, is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable in 4D, the dimension of the coupling constant [κ] must be ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, then the interaction term is superrenormalizable. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, I think I got that backwards. The general rule: in 4D, a term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. The operator's dimension is D. The coupling has dimension [g] = 4 - D. If [g] is positive, the operator is relevant (and the theory is renormalizable). If [g] is negative, the operator is irrelevant (and the theory is non-renormalizable). So in this case, the operator's dimension is 5. So [g] = 4 -5 = -1. So the coupling has negative dimension, which makes the operator irrelevant, which means the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait another moment. The operator here is the term ψ̄ σ F ψ. What's its dimension? Because each ψ is 3/2, so two of them give 3. The F is 2, and σ is 0. So 3 + 2 + 0 = 5. So the operator has dimension 5. So the coupling is [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So the dimension is negative.

But wait, in terms of renormalizability, the interaction term must have a coupling with dimension ≥0. Because in the Feynman diagrams, the vertices would contribute factors of the coupling, and for the theory to be renormalizable, the couplings can't have negative dimensions, otherwise the Feynman diagrams would have higher powers and the theory becomes non-renormalizable.

So in this case, since [κ] is -1, which is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait another thing. I've heard that four-fermion interactions like the Fermi theory of the weak interaction have dimension 6 operators. Their coupling has negative dimension. So they're non-renormalizable but have high energy cutoff.

So in this case, our operator has dimension 5, which is higher than 4. So the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: κ has mass dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, that would be option C.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C: Mass dimension -1, theory not renormalizable.

Yes, that's correct.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \), and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
- The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} \), so \( \bar{\psi} \) also has dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( [F^{\mu\nu}] = 2 \).
- The operator \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is constructed from the gamma matrices \( \gamma_\mu \), which are dimensionless. Thus, \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0 \).

### Step 2: Dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term is \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). Contracting the indices \( \mu \) and \( \nu \), this becomes a Lorentz scalar. The total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}].
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension \( 4 \) in 4 spacetime dimensions, we solve:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
For a theory to be renormalizable in 4 spacetime dimensions, the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must satisfy \( [\kappa] \geq 0 \). In this case, \( [\kappa] = -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is **non-renormalizable** because the coupling has negative mass dimension, leading to an irrelevant operator.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
