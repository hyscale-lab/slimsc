Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states and whether they can be clearly distinguished based on their lifetimes.

Alright, the problem states that there are two energy levels with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve these two levels.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle says that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like energy and time, can be known simultaneously. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but sometimes it's approximated as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So basically, the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval can't be smaller than a certain value. So to resolve two energy levels, their energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty, which is given by ħ divided by the lifetime of the state.

So each state has its own lifetime. But wait, which lifetime do I use? Because each state has a different lifetime. Hmm, maybe the energy uncertainty comes from the measurement process. So perhaps for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ divided by the lifetime of that state.

Wait, the question is about distinguishing two states. So I think the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties from each state? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty from either state? Hmm, not too sure about that part.

Let me think again. Each state has a lifetime, which gives an uncertainty in energy. If ΔE1 is ħ / τ1 and ΔE2 is ħ / τ2, where τ is the lifetime, then the energy difference between the two states should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolved. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, maybe it's hard to tell them apart.

Wait, wait, no. Because each state's energy has an uncertainty. So the energy levels can't be too close; the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainties. So ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2), perhaps? Or maybe it's the maximum of the two? Hmm, not too sure.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Because when you have two states, each with their own uncertainty, the energy resolution would depend on the time you spend measuring. Wait, but in this question, each state has its own lifetime, so perhaps each has its own uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty of the measurement. But wait, the measurement's time is probably the minimum of the two lifetimes? Or perhaps the same measurement time applies. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me get back to the basics. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2. For a state with a lifetime τ, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

So for the first state, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9 s), and for the second, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8 s). Let's compute these.

But wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert that into eV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So let's compute ΔE for each state.

Calculating ΔE1:
ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert J to eV:
1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.
So ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ (1.05457e-25 * 6.242e18) eV.
Let me compute that: 1e-25 * 6e18 = 6e-7. So approximately 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me be more precise. Let me compute 1.0545718e-34 divided by 1e-9:

1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25. So 1.05457e-25 J.

Now converting to eV: 1.05457e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV ≈ 0.658 * 1e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = ħ/(1e-8 s) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / 1e-8 s = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Converting to eV: 1.05457e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ (1.05457 * 6.242) * 1e-8 eV. Let's compute 1.05457 *6.242 ≈ 6.58 again. So 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but since ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2, perhaps the dominant uncertainty is from the first state. Because the first state has a shorter lifetime, so a larger energy uncertainty.

So when trying to measure the energy difference between the two states, the uncertainty in energy from the first state would be larger. So to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the larger of the two ΔEs, or possibly the sum?

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that the energy difference must be larger than the individual uncertainties. Because if E2 and E1 are too close, their energies would be within each other's uncertainties, making them hard to distinguish.

So, the energy difference should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2, perhaps? Let's compute that.

ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, that's about 7.2e-7 eV. Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → much smaller than 7e-7.
Option B) 1e-11 → even smaller.
Option C) 1e-4 → 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger than 7e-7.
Option D) 1e-8 → which is 0.1e-7, or 1e-8 eV, which is much smaller than 7e-7.

Wait, but wait, the sum of the two uncertainties is about 7.2e-7 eV. The energy difference has to be larger than that. So looking at the options, only option C is larger than that.

Wait, no. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 7e-7 eV (which is 0.0000007 eV). So that would satisfy the condition.

The other options are either much smaller than the required sum.

But wait, let me think again. Because perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The Heisenberg Uncertainty for a system is ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt, where Δt is the time over which the system is observed. So if we are measuring both states, the time available for the measurement would be the minimum of the two lifetimes, because if a state has a shorter lifetime, the measurement can't last longer than that without the state decaying.

Wait, that's a good point. Because if you have two states, one with τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 =1e-8 s, the maximum time you can observe both without them decaying is τ1=1e-9 s, because after that time, the first state would have decayed.

So the measurement time Δt is τ1, which is 1e-9 s. So the energy uncertainty for the measurement would be ΔE = ħ / Δt = ħ/(1e-9 s) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, as before.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 6.58e-7. The other options are smaller than this.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says the energy difference must be such that the two can be clearly resolved. The minimal detectable energy difference is determined by the uncertainty, which is ħ/τ, where τ is the time available for measurement.

So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, you can resolve them. So in this case, the measurement time is limited by the shorter lifetime, which is 1e-9 s.

So ΔE = ħ/(1e-9 s) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than this is resolvable.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than this.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with a lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting joules to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For the first state:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For the second state:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the total energy uncertainty, which is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The energy difference must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
