Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and jot down the key points.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest and found those wavelengths are the same. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.

The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and want to compute the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are given as A to D, and I need to find which factor Star_1's luminosity is greater by.

Hmm, okay. Luminosity of a star as a black body. I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that the luminosity L is proportional to the radius squared times the temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πσR²T⁴, right? Since σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and that's the same for both stars, the ratio of their luminosities would be (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

Wait, but the problem here is that we don't have the temperatures directly. However, the stars' emission peaks at the same wavelength. Oh, right! The peak wavelength λ_max for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T = b / λ_max is same for both. Oh, that's a key point. So T1 = T2 = T.

Wait, but wait. Radial velocities are given. Star_1's radial velocity is zero, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. But how does that tie in? Oh, I think Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelength we observe shifts. But in this problem, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, the stars' actual emission peaks (their rest frame λ_max) must be different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear at the same observed λ. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both. But the actual emitted λ_max would be different because of their velocities.

So, the observed λ_max depends on the star's velocity. The formula for Doppler shift in wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ), but wait, I think it's more precise to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, it's approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, no, actually, the relativistic formula is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but that's for light. For stars emitting light, their emitted wavelength is λ0, and the observed wavelength λ depends on their velocity. 

Wait, but wait—since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So, the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor. 

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So, λ1_rest = λ1_obs, since Star_1's velocity is 0. And λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor. So setting λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

Wait, let me write that down:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler shift factor.

But λ_rest is given by Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T.

So, λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So, if λ1_rest = λ2_obs, then:

b / T1 = (λ2_rest) * (Doppler factor).

Wait, but λ2_obs is λ2_rest * Doppler factor. So:

b / T1 = λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs = λ1_obs, so λ2_rest * Doppler factor = λ1_rest.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift equation for λ. The formula is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, v is the radial velocity. Positive v means moving away, which would redshift the light. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, and assuming it's moving away (since its velocity is positive in that direction), its observed wavelength would be longer. But the problem says both observed λ_max are the same.

So, let me set up the equation. Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

But Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ), where v2 is the radial velocity of Star_2.

But wait, the Doppler factor for wavelength is given by (1 + v/c) when v << c, the approximation. But if the velocity is a significant fraction of c, we need to use the exact formula. Let me see: 700 km/s is about 0.7 million km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.00233c. So v/c is approximately 0.00233. So, the approximation may be okay, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

So, let's compute λ2_obs in terms of λ2_rest.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2 / c) / sqrt(1 - (v2^2 / c^2)) )? Wait, no. Wait, the relativistic Doppler effect for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when the source is moving away. Wait, no, let me get the formula right.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), where β = v/c.

But β is positive when moving away. So for Star_2, which has v=700 km/s, moving away, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), where β = 700e3 / (3e5) = 700/(3e5) = 7/(3e2) = approximately 0.002333.

So, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ) ≈ Let's compute numerator and denominator.

(1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333
(1 - 0.002333) ≈ 0.997667

So their ratio is approximately (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ Let me compute that. 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 

Let me calculate 1.002333 / 0.997667:

Approximately 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.0047 (since 0.997667 * 1.0047 ≈ 1.002333). Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it as:

(1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1 + 2a, when a is small. Because (1+a)/(1-a) ≈ (1+a)(1+a) ) when a is small, since 1/(1-a) ≈ 1 + a. So (1+a)/(1-a) ≈ (1+a)(1+a) = 1 + 2a + a². Since a is 0.002333, a² is negligible. So (1+a)/(1-a) ≈ 1 + 2a. So sqrt(1 + 2a) ≈ 1 + a, because sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 for small x.

So, the Doppler factor becomes sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt(1 + 2 * 0.002333) ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.004666) ≈ 1 + 0.004666/2 ≈ 1.002333.

Wait, but wait: that's the approximation. Alternatively, we can compute it more accurately.

So, let's compute (1.002333)/(0.997667) = (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333). Let me compute it as follows:

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1.002333
Denominator: 0.997667

So, 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.0047. Because 0.997667 * 1.0047 ≈ 1.002333.

So, sqrt(1.0047) ≈ let's compute that.

We know that sqrt(1.0047) is about 1.00235. Because (1.0023)^2 = approx 1 + 2*0.0023 + (0.0023)^2 ≈ 1.0046 + 0.000005 ≈ 1.0046. Hmm, but 1.00235 squared is 1.004705, which is close to what we have (1.0047). So the square root is approximately 1.00235.

So, the Doppler factor is approximately 1.00235.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 1.00235.

But we know that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Now, λ1_obs is λ1_rest (since Star_1's radial velocity is 0). So:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 1.00235.

But λ_rest is related to temperature by Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T.

So, λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting into the equation:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.00235.

The b's cancel out:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.00235.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.00235 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So, T1 is approximately 0.99767 times T2.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by L = 4πσR²T⁴. So, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = (2.25) R2².

So, the ratio becomes (2.25) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴).

We have T1 = T2 * 0.99767, so T1 / T2 = 0.99767.

Thus, (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute (0.99767)^4.

First, compute ln(0.99767) ≈ -0.002335.

Multiply by 4: -0.00934.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.00934) ≈ 1 - 0.00934 + (0.00934)^2/2 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, but more accurately, perhaps compute 0.99767^4.

Alternatively, compute 0.99767^2 first.

0.99767 * 0.99767 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995345.

Then, square that again: 0.995345^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00931 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907116.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99071.

So, putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99071 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ Let me compute this.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So, total is approx 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

Wait, but this would be approximately 2.23, which is one of the options. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, another approach perhaps: instead of using the Doppler approximation, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute the Doppler factor more precisely.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s.

β = v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3e2) = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

Wait wait wait! Oh, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, but the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. Wait, no, 3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s. So 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. So c is 3e8 m/s. So β = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.0023333.

Ah, wait, that changes things. Earlier I thought 700 km/s is 0.7 million km/s, which is 7e8 m/s, but wait, no. 1 km is 1e3 m. So 700 km/s is 700 * 1e3 m/s = 7e5 m/s. And c is 3e8 m/s, so β is 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) = 0.0023333. So β is approximately 0.0023333, not 0.023333.

So earlier calculation was correct, β is ~0.002333.

So, the Doppler factor is sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) = sqrt( (1.002333)/(0.997667) ) ≈ 1.002333.

Wait, but let's compute (1.002333)/(0.997667):

Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me compute this as (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333).

Using the approximation (1+a)/(1−a) ≈ 1 + 2a for small a.

So, (1 + 0.002333)/(1−0.002333) ≈ 1 + 2 * 0.002333 = 1.004666.

So, sqrt(1.004666) ≈ 1.00233.

Because (1.00233)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 1.004665, which is very close to 1.004666.

So, the Doppler factor is approximately 1.00233.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 1.00233.

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.00233.

But λ_rest = b / T, so λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So, (b / T1) = (b / T2) * 1.00233.

Canceling b, 1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * 1.00233.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.00233 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So, T1 ≈ 0.99767 * T2.

Then, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (0.99767 T2)^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify: ( (2.25 R2²) * (0.99767^4 T2^4) ) / ( R2² T2^4 ) ) → 2.25 * (0.99767)^4.

As before, compute (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767^2 first:

0.99767 * 0.99767 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995345.

Now, square that: 0.995345^2.

0.995345 * 0.995345 → Let me compute it as (1 - 0.004655)^2.

Which is 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00931 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907116.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99071.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99071 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

0.0007 * 2.25 = 0.001575.

So, total is 2.2275 + 0.001575 = approximately 2.229075.

That's about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute 0.99767^4 another way.

Compute ln(0.99767) = ?

Natural log of 0.99767. Let me approximate it.

ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x²/2 - x^3/3 - ... for small x.

Here, x is 0.00233.

So, ln(0.99767) ≈ -0.00233 - ( (0.00233)^2 )/2 - ... ≈ -0.00233 - (0.0000054289)/2 ≈ -0.00233 - 0.0000027145 ≈ -0.0023327.

So, ln(0.99767^4) = 4 * (-0.0023327) = -0.0093308.

Exponentiating gives e^{-0.0093308} ≈ 1 - 0.0093308 + (0.0093308)^2/2 - (0.0093308)^3/6 + ... 

Approximately, e^{-0.0093308} ≈ 1 - 0.0093308 + (0.000087)/2 - (0.00000081)/6 ≈ 1 - 0.0093308 + 0.0000435 - 0.000000135 ≈ 0.9907126.

Which matches the earlier calculation of ~0.99071.

So, 2.25 * 0.99071 ≈ 2.229075.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So, I'm getting L1/L2 = 2.23, which is option D. But let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ~2.25
B) ~2.32
C) ~2.35
D) ~2.23

So, 2.23 is option D. So that's the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1^2 = (1.5)^2 R_2^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \).
2. **Wavelengths**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying that the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelengths. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, the rest-frame wavelengths are related to the temperatures.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_1 = 0 \), and Star_2 has \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \). The relativistic Doppler shift formula is used to relate the observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}},
   \]
   where \( \beta = v/c \). For Star_2, \( \beta = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333 \), and the Doppler factor is approximately:
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}} \approx 1.00233.
   \]
   Since the observed wavelengths are the same, \( \lambda_1^{\text{rest}} = \lambda_2^{\text{obs}} = \lambda_2^{\text{rest}} \cdot 1.00233 \).

4. **Temperatures**: Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), the ratio of temperatures is:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_2^{\text{rest}}}{\lambda_1^{\text{rest}}} = \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99767.
   \]

### Luminosity Ratio:
Substituting into the luminosity formula:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{(2.25 R_2^2)(0.99767^4 T_2^4)}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.99767)^4.
\]
Calculating \( (0.99767)^4 \):
\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.995345, \quad (0.995345)^2 \approx 0.99071.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99071 \approx 2.229.
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
