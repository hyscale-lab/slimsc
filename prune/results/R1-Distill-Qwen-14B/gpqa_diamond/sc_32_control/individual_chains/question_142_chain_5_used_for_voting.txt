Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the geometric position of a density matrix in qubit space. Let's see... The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

Wait, the options given are about r-values: points in a 3D space or something. Oh, right, for a single qubit, the space can be represented using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector describes the state, right? So the density matrix is a way to represent the state, and its corresponding Bloch vector gives its position on the sphere.

I think the density matrix for a pure state would be a vector on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are inside. For example, the completely mixed state is the maximally mixed state, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Oh wait, that's exactly what ρ is here.

So, the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere because the Bloch vector is zero. Because for a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is (I + 0·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So the vector part (the part multiplied by σ) is zero, meaning r = (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer. Let me make sure. Another way to think about it: the density matrix ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ½(I + [x, y, z] · σ), where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. If all the x, y, z terms are zero, then the vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option C.

The density matrix given is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which corresponds to the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are related to the components of the density matrix. For a maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector is zero, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This is because the maximally mixed state has no coherence and equal populations in both the \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) states, corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**
