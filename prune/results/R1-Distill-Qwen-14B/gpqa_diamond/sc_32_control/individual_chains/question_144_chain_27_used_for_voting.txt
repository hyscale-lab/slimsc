Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about meson decay. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a different distance in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. I think the formula involves the lifetime and the speed of the particle. Oh right, the mean decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I get tau from the given width Γ? Oh right, the relation between the width and the lifetime is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime tau is inversely proportional to Γ. The formula is tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using tau = ħ / Γ.
2. Determine gamma (Lorentz factor) using E and m.
3. Find beta (v/c) from gamma and m.
4. Compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy E should be the total energy, which is gamma * m c^2. So gamma = E / (m c^2). Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, let me write the formulas correctly.

First, E_X = gamma * m_X c^2 → gamma = E_X / (m_X c^2). Since E and m are given in GeV, but c is in m/s, I'll need to convert units appropriately.

Next, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)). But wait, sometimes beta is approximated when gamma is large, but maybe I should calculate it accurately.

Then, tau = hbar / (Γ). But Γ is given in MeV, which is 320 MeV. I need to convert that into Joules because hbar is in J·s.

Wait, let's get the constants right.

Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, let's think about the units. Since Γ is in MeV (which is a unit of energy), we can convert it to Joules.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So Γ = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J ≈ 5.126976e-11 J.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-11 J) ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems really small. But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, which is indeed tiny for particles like mesons.

Now, moving on. Let's calculate gamma. E_X is 8 GeV, which is 8e9 eV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV, so 1.2e9 eV. To convert E and m to Joules, since E = gamma m c^2, and c^2 is (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but since the final answer is in meters, I need to handle the units correctly.

Alternative approach:

Compute gamma = E_X / (m_X c²). Let's compute E in J and m in kg.

Wait, E_X = 8 GeV = 8e9 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E_X = 8e9 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.2816e-9 J.

m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². To find the mass in kg, since 1 GeV/c² is approximately 1.7827e-27 kg. So m_X = 1.2 * 1.7827e-27 kg ≈ 2.1392e-27 kg.

Then, gamma = E_X / (m_X c^2). Let's compute m_X c^2. m_X c² is (1.2 GeV) which is 1.2e9 eV. So m_X c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So E_X is 8 GeV, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, that's much simpler. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 which is 6.666..., which is 20/3.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma²)) = sqrt(1 - (9/(400))) → since 1/gamma² is 9/(400) because (20/3)^2 is 400/9, so 1/(400/9) is 9/400.

So, 1 - 9/400 = (400-9)/400 = 391/400.

So beta is sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20. Let me compute sqrt(391). Hmm, 19^2 is 361, 20^2 is 400. 391 is 9 less than 400, so sqrt(391) is about 19.774. So 19.774 /20 is approximately 0.9887.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

Now, L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime. The lifetime experienced in the lab frame is gamma * tau. Because of time dilation. Because particles moving at high speeds (relativistic) live longer in the lab frame.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the mean decay length is L = v * (gamma tau). Because v is beta c, L = beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, L = gamma beta c tau.

Wait, I think that's correct. So:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

We have gamma = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

beta ≈0.9887.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but earlier I computed tau as 2.056e-24 seconds. Let me double-check that.

Gamma is 320 MeV. Converting to J: 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So Γ = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Yes, that's correct.

So putting it all together:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

beta ≈0.9887.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056e-24 s.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.9887 ≈ (6.6667) * 0.9887 ≈6.6667*0.9887 ≈ approx 6.6667 *0.9887.

Let me compute that exactly. 6.6667 *0.9887.

Let me think: 6 *0.9887 =5.9322; 0.6667 *0.9887≈0.658. So total is around 6.5902.

Wait, exact calculation. 0.9887 * 6.6666666667.

= (6 * 0.9887) + (0.6666666667 * 0.9887)

=5.9322 + (0.6666666667 *0.9887). Let me compute 0.6666666667 *0.9887.

0.6666666667 is 2/3. 2/3 * 0.9887 = approx (2 * 0.9887)/3 ≈ 1.9774 /3 ≈0.6591.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5913.

Then, c * tau =3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = 6.168e-16 m.

Wait, 3e8 *2.056e-24 = (3 *2.056) * 1e8 *1e-24 = 6.168 * 1e-16 =6.168e-16 m.

So now, L is gamma * beta * c tau =6.5913 *6.168e-16 m.

Let me compute that.

6.5913 *6.168e-16.

6.5913 *6.168 = approx?

Well, 6 *6 is 36. 6 *0.168=1.008; 0.5913 *6=3.5478; 0.5913 *0.168≈0.099.

Wait, maybe better to compute exact:

6.5913 * 6.168.

Compute 6 *6.168 =37.008.

0.5913 *6.168 = compute 0.5 *6.168=3.084; 0.0913*6.168≈0.563. So total 3.084+0.563=3.647.

So total is 37.008 +3.647≈40.655.

Wait, that can't be right because 6.5913 *6.168 is not 40.655. Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up.

No, wait, no, wait. 6.5913 * 6.168. Maybe I should calculate it properly.

Wait, 6 *6.168 = 37.008.

0.5 *6.168=3.084.

0.0913 *6.168 = approx 0.563.

So 37.008 +3.084 =40.092, plus 0.563 gives 40.655. So 6.5913 *6.168 ≈40.655.

Wait, that would mean 40.655e-16 m. Wait, no. Because we have 6.5913 multiplied by 6.168e-16, which is 40.655e-16 m.

Wait, but 40.655e-16 m is 4.0655e-15 m, because 40e-16 is 4e-15.

Wait, no. 40.655e-16 m is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the decay length L is approximately 4.0655e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculations? Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667. Beta is around 0.9887. So gamma * beta is about 6.5913. Then, c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s =6.168e-16 m.

So 6.5913 *6.168e-16 m = (6.5913 * 6.168) * 1e-16 m. Earlier calculation estimated that product as ~40.655, so 40.655e-16 m =4.0655e-15 m.

So yes, the decay length is 4.0655e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but why is option C 5.0223e-15? Let me think — perhaps I messed up the calculation for gamma * beta or the units in tau.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for tau. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Γ is 320 MeV =320e6 eV. So converting to J: 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320e6 *1.602e-19 =320e6 *1.602e-19 = (3.2e8) *1.602e-19? Wait, no, 320e6 is 3.2e8? No, wait:

320 MeV is 320 *1e6 eV, so 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So Γ =320e6 *1.602e-19 J = 320e6 *1.602e-19 = (320 *1.602) *1e6 *1e-19 = 512.64 * 1e-13 =5.1264e-11 J. So yes, correct.

Tau = ħ / Γ = 1.0545718e-34 /5.1264e-11 = approx 2.056e-24 seconds.

Hmm, all correct.

Another possible problem: Did I calculate beta correctly? Wait, the mass is 1.2 GeV, production energy 8 GeV.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²) =8/(1.2) =6.6667. That's correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - m²/(E² c^4)) *c. Wait, but in natural units where c=1, beta is sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)). So yes, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

1.2^2 is 1.44, 8^2 is 64. So 1.44/64 =0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So beta is correct.

Another thought: Could the decay length formula be L=gamma * v * tau? Wait, no, because tau is proper time. So in lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the distance would be v * gamma tau. But v is beta c, so yes, L= beta c gamma tau. So the calculation is correct.

So the final decay length is approximately 4.0655e-15 meters, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the ratio of the particle's velocity to the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \), we convert it to joules:
\[
\Gamma = 320 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 5.1264 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}.
\]

Using \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we find:
\[
\tau = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.1264 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2},
\]
where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Converting to natural units (\( c = 1 \)), we find:
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using the relation:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}},
\]
we substitute \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \):
\[
L = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):
\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau \):
\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8)(2.056 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.168 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):
\[
L = (6.5913)(6.168 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **option B**.

**Answer: B**
