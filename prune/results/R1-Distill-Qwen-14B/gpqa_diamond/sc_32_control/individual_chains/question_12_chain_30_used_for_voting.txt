Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics and energy calculations. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a Pi(+) particle is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial momentum must be zero. The rest masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. The options are about the kinetic energies of the product particles.

Hmm, right. So, in particle decay problems, especially when the parent is at rest, I remember that the key is to consider conservation of energy and momentum. Since the parent is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, sometimes considered massless in these problems. But wait, in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for this problem, I think we can treat the neutrino as massless unless stated otherwise. So I'll go with that assumption unless I see a reason not to.

So, the process is π+ → μ+ + ν (a neutrino). Let's denote the muon as m and the neutrino as n.

First, I need to find the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the pi is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, energy and momentum have to be conserved. Let's model this.

Let me denote:
- m_π = 139.6 MeV/c² (rest mass of pion)
- m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c² (rest mass of muon)
- m_ν ≈ 0 (assuming massless neutrino)

The initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta must cancel each other. So, the muon has momentum p, and the neutrino has momentum -p.

The energy of the muon is E_μ = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, wait, no. Let me get the units right. Energy is in MeV, masses are in MeV/c², so when I compute the energy, I'll have to make sure the units work out.

Wait, perhaps it's better to work in units where c=1. So, E_μ = sqrt( p² + m_μ² ), and E_ν = |p|, since m_ν is zero.

The total energy after decay is E_μ + E_ν = m_π (since initial energy is just m_π c², but with c=1, it's m_π).

So,

sqrt(p² + m_μ²) + p = m_π

Let me write that equation:

sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

I can let x = p, so it's sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6

Hmm, so I can solve for x. Let me isolate sqrt(x² + a²) = 139.6 - x, where a is m_μ.

Square both sides:

x² + a² = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So,

x² + a² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

a² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x

Now, rearrange to solve for x:

2*139.6 x = (139.6)^2 - a²

x = [ (139.6)^2 - a² ] / (2 * 139.6 )

Plugging in a=105.7:

Compute (139.6)^2: Let me calculate that.

139.6 squared: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is slightly less. Alternatively, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 (MeV²)

a squared is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 (MeV²)

So,

x = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / (2 * 139.6 )

Calculate numerator: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute this.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2: Let's see, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ? Let me compute 279.2 *30 = 8376, then subtract 279.2 *0.2 = 55.84, so 8376 -55.84=8320.16. Hmm, close to 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 *29.8= 279.2*(30-0.2)= 8376 -55.84 =8320.16.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 4.49 less than 8320.16. So perhaps 29.8 - some small amount.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Another approach: 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, 279.2 * 29.8 = 8320.16.

We have 8315.67 is 8320.16 - 4.49. So 279.2 * (29.8 - delta) = 8315.67.

So, 279.2 * delta = 4.49 → delta = 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So x ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 = 29.784. Approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the neutrino's energy E_ν = p ≈29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy E_μ = sqrt( p² + m_μ² ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78 squared: 29.78^2 = approx 886.7.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sqrt(886.7 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.19) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the pion's mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's energy is 109.81? That would leave the neutrino at 29.78, and 109.81 + 29.78 = 139.59, which is close to 139.6. So that's correct.

Wait, but then the muon's kinetic energy is E_μ - m_μ. Because E_μ is the total energy, and m_μ c² is its rest energy. So, KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ.

So,

KE_μ = 109.81 MeV -105.7 MeV = 4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_ν, since it's massless. So 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → No, KE_μ is 4.11 close to 4.12.

B) 7.2, 32.8 → No.

C)3.52, 20.8 → No.

D)4.12, 29.8 → Yes.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of the stationary π⁺ particle into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The neutrino is assumed massless (\( m_\nu \approx 0 \)).

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
Since the π⁺ is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum of the products must also be zero, meaning the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta (\( p_\mu = -p_\nu \)).

The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the π⁺:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
\[
E_{\mu} + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The energy of the muon is given by:  
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]  
and the energy of the neutrino is:  
\[
E_\nu = |p|,
\]  
where \( p \) is the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (equal to the neutrino's momentum).

### Solving for \( p \)
Substituting \( E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \) and \( E_\nu = p \) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]  
Let \( m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Isolating \( \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \( p^2 \):  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p.
\]  
Rearranging for \( p \):  
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]  
Substituting \( m_{\pi^+}^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2 \) and \( m_{\mu}^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2 \):  
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is:  
\[
E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's total energy is:  
\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{886.7 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.19} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the neutrino's energy is \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
