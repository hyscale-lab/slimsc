Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about scattering amplitudes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, phase shifts... right, in scattering theory, especially in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of these phase shifts. The formula I vaguely remember is something like f(θ) being a sum over l of (something with phase shifts δ_l). Oh right, the general form for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) * Pl(cosθ) ) ), where Pl is the Legendre polynomial. 

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0. So, cosθ would be 1, right? Because cos(0) is 1. So Pl(1) is 1 for all l, since Pl(1)=1 for any l. That simplifies things a lot. 

So the formula simplifies to f(θ=0) = (1/(2i)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1). 

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute the imaginary part. So I need to find Im[f(θ=0)]. Let me break it down. 

First, let's expand e^{2iδ_l} - 1. Using Euler's formula, e^{iφ} = cosφ + i sinφ, so e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Subtract 1: (cos(2δ_l) - 1) + i sin(2δ_l). 

So when we multiply each term by (2l+1) and sum, the imaginary part will come from the sine terms. 

So the entire expression for f is (1/(2i)) multiplied by the sum. Let me write that out:

f = (1/(2i)) * sum [ ( (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ) * (2l+1) ) ]

Breaking this into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: (1/(2i)) * sum [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) (2l+1) ) * (1) ] 
Imaginary part: (1/(2i)) * sum [ (sin(2δ_l) (2l+1) ) * i ]

Wait, but when you have a complex number multiplied by i, it can change the real and imaginary parts. Let me think about it again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part by focusing on the term that contributes to it.

Wait, f = (1/(2i)) * sum [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) ]

Let me factor out the 1/(2i): 

f = [ 1/(2i) ] * sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ]

The sum is a complex number. To find the imaginary part, I can write each term as A + iB, then sum, and then take the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each term:

e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{iδ_l}^2 -1 = (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l)^2 -1 

But maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, note that e^{iθ} -1 = e^{iθ/2} * (e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2}) ) = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2). Wait, but that's for e^{iθ} -1. Our case is e^{2iδ_l} -1, which would be 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. 

Yes, because e^{iφ} -1 = e^{iφ/2} (e^{iφ/2} - e^{-iφ/2}) ) = 2i e^{iφ/2} sin(φ/2). So setting φ=2δ_l, you get e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So substituting this into the sum:

sum [ (2l+1) * (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] = sum [ (2l+1) * 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ]

So the expression becomes:

f = (1/(2i)) * [ 2i sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ]

The 2i and 1/(2i) simplify:

(1/(2i)) * 2i is 1. So f= sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l 

Wait, no. Wait, let me compute that step again. 

The term is (1/(2i)) multiplied by sum [ (2l+1) * (2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l) ]

Which is (1/(2i)) * 2i sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]

The 2i and 2i denominator cancel each other: 2i / (2i) = 1. So f = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l

So f = sum_{l=0}^n (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l 

Wait, but then what's the imaginary part of f? 

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. 

Wait, e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So this term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l 

Multiply that out: (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

So each term is (2l+1) [ (1/2 sin 2δ_l) ) + i ( (1 - cos 2δ_l)/2 ) ]

So that's (2l+1)( [ (sin 2δ_l )/2 ] ) i term, and a real part. 

But we're interested in the imaginary part of f. So each term contributes (2l+1) [ (sin 2δ_l )/2 ] * i. 

Wait, no. Let me see: the term is (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ]

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) * sin² δ_l. Because the term is (2l+1) [ ... + i (sin² δ_l) ]

Wait, no. Wait, (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ] = (2l+1) [ (sin δ cos δ) + i sin^2 δ ]

So the real part is (2l+1) sin δ cos δ and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin^2 δ.

But when you sum all the terms, f is the sum of these. Therefore, the imaginary part of f is sum_{l} (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, no, because each term contributes a real part and an imaginary part. So the total f is sum of (real parts) + i sum of (imaginary parts). So the imaginary part of f is sum_{l} (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, but let me double-check:

Each term: (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ] 

So, the imaginary part is (2l+1)* sin² δ, and the real part is (2l+1)* sin δ cos δ.

So when summing all terms, the imaginary part is sum( (2l+1) sin² δ_l ), and the real part is sum( (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l )

But since the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam, which is Im[f(θ=0)] = sum( (2l+1) sin² δ_l )

Wait, but actually, the formula for f is the sum that we derived, which has an imaginary part equal to sum( (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l )

Wait, but earlier steps: f = sum_{l} (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ]

Which can be written as f = sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ]

Hmm, but perhaps I should think in terms of f as a complex number. So the imaginary part of f is sum( (2l+1) sin² δ_l )

Wait, but in the initial calculation when we used e^{2iδ} -1 = 2i e^{iδ} sin δ, and then f became sum (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ. 

Wait, no, earlier step: f = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l 

Because after all the simplifications, f = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l 

So if I write that as sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l 

Which is sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l + i (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ]

So the imaginary part is sum( (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l )

Therefore, Im[f] = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l 

Because the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so the given δ's are δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13 degrees. So l=0 to l=4.

So now I can compute each term:

For l=0: (2*0+1)=1. sin^2(90 degrees) is sin^2(90)=1. So term is 1 * 1 = 1.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, is the phase shift given in degrees or radians? The question says degrees. So yes, sin 90 is 1.

l=0: 1 * (sin 90)^2 = 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * (sin 67°)^2. Let me calculate sin(67). Let me compute in degrees. Sin(60) is ~0.866, sin(67) is about 0.9205. So (0.9205)^2 ~ 0.847. So 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2: 5 * (sin55)^2. Sin55 is about 0.8192. Squared is ~0.671. Multiply by 5: 3.355.

l=3:7 * (sin30)^2. Sin30 is 0.5. Squared is 0.25. 7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4:9 * (sin13)^2. Sin(13 degrees) is approx 0.2249. Squared is ~0.0506. Multiply by 9: 0.455.

Now sum all these:

l=0:1

l=1:2.541 → total 3.541

l=2:3.355 → total 6.896

l=3:1.75 → 8.646

l=4:0.455 → total 9.101

So Im[f] is approximately 9.101.

Wait, but wait, the options are in the hundreds or thousands of fm. So 9 is way too small. Hmm, did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Because 9 is way smaller than the options. 

Let me re-examine the steps. Oh! Wait a second. The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ ... ], but wait, what's k? Or does the formula involve the wave number or something else?

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is related to the cross-section via |f|^2, but perhaps the formula I used was for the partial wave expansion, but perhaps I forgot a factor of 1/k or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used was for the differential cross-section, but no, the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Wait, let me double-check the formula for the scattering amplitude. The general expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2i)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l + 1) P_l(cosθ) )

But in our case, θ=0, so P_l(1)=1, so f(θ=0) = (1/(2i)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1)

Which as earlier, simplifies to f(θ=0) = sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l

Wait, because e^{2iδ} -1 = 2i e^{iδ} sin δ. So substituting that, we have:

f = (1/(2i)) * sum [ (2i e^{iδ} sin δ) (2l+1) ]

Which becomes sum (e^{i δ} sin δ) (2l+1) * ( 2i / (2i) ) = sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ )

So that's correct. So f = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ.

Then the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ.

Wait, but when I computed that, the sum was about 9.1, but the options are way larger.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I missed the factor of k, the wave number. Because in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f has dimensions of length (it's in fm, I think, as the options are in fm). But the formula I used doesn't have any factors of k, so maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, wait, let me think about the expression for f in terms of k. The general expression is f = (1/(2ik)) sum ( etc ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in terms of the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of f to the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total = 4π |f|^2 (or something like that?), but the imaginary part of f is related to the total scattering amplitude.

Wait, wait, I may have missed a factor of (k), because in the expression for the scattering amplitude, f is proportional to 1/k. Hmm, because the cross-section is typically proportional to |f|^2, which would then have 1/k^2 dependence.

Wait, I think I missed a factor of k in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula.

The correct expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l + 1) ) / (2ik) ) * P_l(cosθ)

So when θ=0, it's f = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) )

Which, when we substitute e^{2iδ_l}-1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, we get:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ]

The 2i and 1/(2i) cancel, leaving f = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )

So the imaginary part is Im[f] = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l )

Ah, so I forgot the factor of 1/k earlier. That explains why my calculation was so small.

So now, the question is, what is k? k is the wave number, which is given by k = E / (ħ c), but wait, in natural units where ħ= c=1, but perhaps in these problems, it's better to compute k in terms of the given energy.

Wait, the energy given is 50 MeV electrons. So we need to compute k, the wave number.

The energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, so we can assume it's a high-energy (non-relativistic? Wait, no, 50 MeV is relativistic, because for electrons, 50 MeV is many times the rest mass (0.511 MeV). So relativistic, so we can use the relativistic expression for the energy and momentum.

The relativistic energy is E = γ m c^2. The momentum is p = γ m v. But for electrons, when E >> m c^2, we can approximate p ≈ E / c. Because, for high energies, E ≈ pc. So wave number k = p / ħ. 

So k = p / ħ ≈ E/( ħ c )

Given E=50 MeV. Let's compute it in units that make sense.

First, let's compute E in Joules.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 8.0109e-13 J.

But ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So let's compute k:

k = E/( ħ c )

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The energy E is related to the momentum p via E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. For E much larger than m c^2, E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E / c. 

So k = p / ħ ≈ (E/(c)) / ħ = E/( ħ c )

Plugging in the numbers:

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

So k = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s )

Calculate denominator: 1.05457e-34 *3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J m

k = (8.01e-13) / (3.1637e-26) ) m^-1

Calculate that: 8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 ≈ (8.01 / 3.1637) ) * 1e13 = approximately 2.53 * 1e13 m^-1 → 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, but 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So 1 m is 1e15 fm. So 1/m = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So k in fm^{-1}: 2.53e13 m^-1 * 1e-15 fm/m = 2.53e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 2.53e13 m^-1 = 2.53e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 2.53e-2 fm^{-1}.

So k = 0.0253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so Im[f] is (1/k) * sum ( (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l )

Sum was about 9.1. So Im[f] = (9.1) / (0.0253 fm^{-1}) )

Wait, because 1/k has units of fm, since k is in fm^{-1}.

So 9.1 / 0.0253 ≈ 359.3.

But looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is close. Hmm, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Let me recompute the sum accurately:

Compute each term precisely:

l=0: (2l+1) =1. δ0=90°. sin^2(90)=1. So term=1*1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin^2(67°). Let's compute sin(67°).

Using calculator, sin(67°) ≈ 0.92050485345. Square is (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.847305. Multiply by 3: 2.541915.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°). sin(55)= approx 0.81915204428. Squared is ~0.671015. Multiply by 5: 3.355075.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30°). Sin30 is 0.5. Square is 0.25. Multiply by7: 1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13°). Sin13 ≈ 0.2249510543. Square is (0.22495)^2 ≈ 0.050607. Multiply by9: 0.45546.

Now sum all terms:

1 + 2.541915 = 3.541915

+3.355075 → 6.89699

+1.75 → 8.64699

+0.45546 → 9.10245.

So sum is approximately 9.10245.

Now compute 9.10245 / (0.0253 fm^{-1} ) = 9.10245 / 0.0253 ≈ 

Compute 9.10245 / 0.0253:

0.0253 × 359 = approx 9.1027. 

Because 0.0253 *359 = (0.025 *359) + (0.0003 *359) = 8.975 + 0.1077= 9.0827.

Wait, 359 → 0.0253 *359=9.0827. Our sum is 9.10245. Close, but need to be exact.

Compute 0.0253 * x =9.10245 → x=9.10245 /0.0253.

Compute this:

0.0253 * 359 =9.0827.

Difference: 9.10245 -9.0827=0.01975.

0.01975 /0.0253 ≈ 0.78.

So x=359.78. So approximately 359.78 fm.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Hmm. Wait, my calculation is about 359.78, but option B is 355.351. Close, but not exact. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated k. Let me recompute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV. Let's compute E in Joules.

1 eV =1.602176634e-19 J.

So 50 MeV =50e6 eV *1.602176634e-19 =50e6 *1.602176634e-19 =8.01088317e-13 J.

ħ =1.054571817e-34 J·s.

c=299792458 m/s.

So k= E/(ħ c) = (8.01088317e-13 J) / (1.054571817e-34 J·s * 299792458 m/s )

Compute denominator: 1.054571817e-34 *2.99792458e8 = 3.16158155e-26 J·m.

So k=8.01088317e-13 /3.16158155e-26 = (8.01088317 /3.16158155 ) *1e13 → approx 2.534 *1e13 m^-1.

Wait, 8.01088317 /3.16158155 ≈ let's compute:

3.16158155 *2.5 =7.903953875. 8.01088317-7.903953875=0.106929295.

So 0.106929295 /3.16158155 ≈0.0338. So total 2.5 +0.0338=2.5338.

So k=2.5338e13 m^-1.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m=1e15 fm, so 1 m^-1 =1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 2.5338e13 m^-1 =2.5338e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =2.5338e-2 fm^{-1} → which is 0.025338 fm^{-1}.

So Im[f]= sum /k → 9.10245 /0.025338 ≈

Compute 9.10245 /0.025338.

Let me compute 9.10245 /0.025338.

Approximate:

0.025338 * 359 = 9.10245? Let's compute 0.025338 *359.

0.025338 *300=7.6014

0.025338 *59= approx 1.504.

Total 7.6014 +1.504=9.1054.

Which is a bit over our sum of 9.10245. So 359 gives 9.1054, which is a bit higher. So perhaps 358.8 would give 9.10245.

But let's compute precisely 9.10245 /0.025338.

Let me calculate:

Denominator:0.025338 → 2.5338e-2.

So 9.10245 /0.025338 = 9.10245 * (1/0.025338) =9.10245 *39.485 ≈ 

Wait, 1/0.025338 ≈ approx 39.485.

So 9.10245 *39.485 ≈ Let me compute 9 *39.485 = 355.365. 0.10245 *39.485 ≈4.057.

So total is ≈355.365 +4.057≈359.422.

Wait, but that can't be because 0.025338 *359.422= approx 9.10245.

But earlier calculation when 0.025338 *359=9.1054, which is a bit higher than 9.10245. So perhaps 359 - (9.1054 -9.10245)/0.025338.

Difference is 0.00295. 0.00295 /0.025338 ≈0.116. So 359 - 0.116=358.884.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Compute 9.10245 ÷0.025338.

Let me write 9.10245 / 0.025338.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to make it easier: 9102450 /25338.

Compute how many times 25338 fits into 9102450.

25338 *359 = ?

Compute 25338 *300=7,601,400.

25338 *50=1,266,900 → total to 350: 7,601,400 +1,266,900=8,868,300.

Now 25338 *9=228,042 → 8,868,300 +228,042=9,096,342.

Which is just under 9,102,450. The difference is 9,102,450 -9,096,342=6,108.

Now, 25338 *0.24= approximately 6,081.12. So 0.24 would bring us to 9,096,342 +6,081.12=9,102,423.12.

Which is very close to 9,102,450. So 359.24 gives us 9,102,423.12, very close.

So the quotient is 359.24 → approximately 359.24.

So Im[f] ≈359.24 fm.

But the options are 355.351 (B) and 177.675 (C).

Hmm, my calculation of 359 is about 359, which is not exactly in the options. The closest is B)355.351, which is about 4 less. Did I make a mistake in the sum or in the calculation of k?

Wait, let me recheck the sum.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * (sin90)^2 =1*1=1 → correct.

l=1:3 * (sin67)^2.

Compute sin67° as accurate as possible.

Using calculator: sin67=0.92050485345.

Square is 0.847305 (exactly: 0.92050485345^2 = (0.92050485345)^2 = let me compute 0.92 *0.92= 0.8464, 0.9205^2 = (0.9205)^2 = 0.847305025.

Square:0.2249510543^2= 0.050607035.

Multiply by9: 0.455463315 → correct.

Summing terms:

1 +2.541915075=3.541915075

+3.3550760125 → 6.8969910875

+1.75 →8.6469910875

+0.455463315→9.1024544025.

So sum is 9.1024544025.

Now, Im[f] = sum/(k) → 9.1024544025 /0.025338 fm^{-1}.

Wait, what's 9.1024544025 /0.025338?

Compute 9.1024544025 ÷0.025338.

Let me compute 0.025338 *359 = ?

Compute 0.025338 *359.

359 *0.025338 = ?

Compute 359 *0.025=8.975.

359 *0.000338= 0.121.

So total 8.975 +0.121=9.096.

But our sum is 9.10245, which is 9.10245 -9.096=0.00645 higher.

So 0.00645 /0.025338 ≈0.00645/0.025338≈0.2545.

So 359 +0.2545=359.2545 → Im[f]≈359.25 fm.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, not degrees? No, the question says degrees.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by k, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor I missed.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (k * Im[f]) where f is dimensionless. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum ... and when I computed Im[f], I have to consider that.

Wait, let's re-express f correctly. The correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (e^{2i δ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ)

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f= (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1)(2l+1).

As before, e^{2i δ} -1 = 2i e^{i δ} sin δ. So substituting:

f= (1/(2ik)) sum (2i e^{i δ} sin δ) (2l+1)

The 2i and 1/(2i) cancel, so f = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ )

So f = (1/(k)) sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

So the imaginary part of f is Im[f] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which is what we have.

So our calculation is correct. So with k=0.025338 fm^-1, the value is 9.10245 /0.025338 ≈359.25 fm.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is B:355.351.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of k, I should use the non-relativistic expression for E? No, 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, so non-relativistic doesn't apply. But wait, let me check.

The correct relativistic relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

But for E >> m c^2, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/(c).

But perhaps I should use the exact expression.

Let me compute p.

E=50 MeV.

m c^2 for electron is 0.511 MeV.

So (m c^2)^2 = (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2.

E^2 = (50)^2 + (0.511)^2 → approx 50^2 =2500.

So E≈50 MeV, much larger than 0.511. So p≈E/c.

But perhaps I should compute k more accurately, using the exact p.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

But E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ≈ E^2.

So p≈E/c.

But let me compute p accurately.

E =50 MeV.

mc²=0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c.

But 50^2 is 2500, (0.511)^2 is ~0.261, so sqrt(2500 -0.261)=sqrt(2499.739)≈49.99739 MeV.

p =49.99739 MeV /c.

But since E=50 MeV, p≈49.9974 MeV/c.

Now, k = p / ħ.

But how to compute ħ in units where E is in MeV and c in m/s?

Wait, perhaps better to compute k in terms of E and ħ c.

Wait, ħ c in units of MeV fm: ħ c ≈ 197.327 MeV fm.

Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm.

So, if ħ c ≈197.3 MeV fm,

Then k = p/(ħ) = (p c )/( ħ c ) → (p c) / (197.3 MeV fm )

p c = (49.9974 MeV) → So k = (49.9974 MeV) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) → 49.9974 /197.3 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

The wave number k is given by k = p / ħ. But p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in J s.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of [p (MeV/c)] / [ ħ c (MeV fm) ]

Wait, because:

p (MeV/c) * c (m/s) → gives p in MeV s^{-1} m.

But I think I'm complicating.

Another approach: Since ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm, which is a known value.

So, ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c )/( ħ c ) → (p c ) / (197.3 MeV fm )

But p c is (50 MeV) approximately, as before.

So, k ≈ (50 MeV) / (197.3 MeV fm ) ) =50/197.3 fm^{-1} → approximately 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but earlier calculation via J and m gave k≈0.0253 fm^{-1}.

There's a discrepancy here. So which is correct?

Ah, I think I'm confusing units. Let me clarify.

The correct formula for the wave number k is:

k = p / (ħ)

But p is in kg m/s, ħ in J s = kg m²/s. So k has units m^{-1}.

But when using natural units where ħ c is expressed in MeV fm, let me compute it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k using the relation:

k = (E) / (ħ c)

Wait, but E is in MeV, ħ c is in MeV fm.

So, E/(ħ c ) → (MeV) / (MeV fm ) → 1/fm.

So,

k = E/( ħ c ) → (50 MeV) / (197.3 MeV fm ) ) =50 /197.3 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}

So k=0.2535 fm^{-1}

Wait, that's different from the earlier 0.0253 fm^{-1}.

Hmm. So which approach is correct?

I think the confusion arises from unit conversion. Let me recompute k accurately.

Given E=50 MeV.

We have:

ħ c ≈ 197.327 MeV·fm.

So, k = E/(ħ c ) → (50 MeV) / (197.327 MeV·fm) ) → 50 /197.327 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So k=0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Wait, this makes sense because when E is in MeV, and ħ c is in MeV fm, then k has units of 1/fm.

So earlier calculation using J and m was wrong because unit conversions were mishandled.

So, the correct k is approximately 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So now, Im[f]= sum /k → 9.10245 / 0.2535 ≈35.91 fm.

Wait, that's way lower than the options. Hmm, something's wrong.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is Im[f] = (1/k) sum(...) → sum is about 9.102, k is 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So 9.102 /0.2535 → approx 35.91 fm.

Wait, but the options are in the hundreds or thousands. So this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. The formula for f is (1/(2ik)) sum ... → which would mean that f has dimensions of 1/k, since sum is dimensionless.

So if k is in fm^{-1}, then f is in fm. So Im[f] is in fm.

But in our calculation, sum is 9.102, k is 0.2535, so 9.102/0.2535≈35.91 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps the formula is different.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(k)) sum ( ... )

But I thought it was (1/(2ik)) sum(...). Maybe I missed a factor of 2.

Wait, let me check a textbook formula.

The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) )/(2ik) ) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}

In the case of θ=0 and ignoring φ dependence (or assuming it's summed over), we get:

f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) )

So when you compute f, it's (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum.

Previously, I found that e^{2iδ} -1 = 2i e^{i δ} sin δ. Substituting, f becomes:

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ 2i e^{i δ} sin δ (2l+1) ]

Which simplifies to:

f = (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

The 2i and 1/(2i) cancel, leaving f = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

So f = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) (cos δ + i sin δ) sin δ ]

Which separates into real and imaginary parts.

Im[f] = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ ]

So Im[f] = sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ ] / k.

So if k is 0.2535 fm^{-1}, and sum is ~9.102, then Im[f]=9.102 /0.2535 ≈35.91 fm.

But none of the options are near that. The options are 355, 177, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for k is k = (E)/(ħ c) → but with E in eV units.

Let me recompute k correctly.

Compute k in fm^{-1} using E=50 MeV.

Given ħ c = 197.327 MeV fm.

k = E/( ħ c ) = 50 MeV / (197.327 MeV fm) ) → 50/197.327 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Yes, that's correct.

So Im[f]=9.102 /0.2535≈35.91 fm.

But none of the options are near 35.91.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees? No, the question says degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total cross-section, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by k, but that would give 35.91 *0.2535≈9.09, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I have confused the formula and should compute the real part instead. No, the question says the imaginary part.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, let me recompute the sum.

l=0:1 * sin^2(90)=1 → 1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67)=3 * (0.9205)^2 =3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506=0.4554.

Adding: 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

So sum is 9.1023.

Hmm, I'm getting the same sum.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but calculations should be done in radians.

Wait, that would change everything. Let's see.

If I mistakenly used degrees instead of radians, but actually, the formula uses radians because in the e^{i delta} term, delta must be in radians.

Wait, but the phase shifts were given in degrees, so I must convert them to radians before using them in the formula.

Oh! That's a mistake I made. I used sin(67 degrees), but I should have converted degrees to radians first.

Ah, this is a crucial point. I think this is where the error is.

So, I need to convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin^2 δ_l.

So let me do that.

Compute each δ in radians:

δ0=90 degrees → π/2 radians ≈1.5708 rad.

δ1=67 degrees →67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ2=55 degrees →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 rad.

δ3=30 degrees →30 * π/180 =π/6 ≈0.523599 rad.

δ4=13 degrees →13 * π/180≈0.226893 rad.

Now compute sin^2 δ for each:

l=0: sin(1.5708)=1 → sin^2=1.

l=1: sin(1.16937) ≈ sin(67 degrees)=0.9205 → sin^2≈0.8473.

Ah, same as before. Wait, but wait, the phase shifts are in degrees, but when calculating in the formula, the delta must be in radians.

But wait, the formula uses δ in radians because it's part of e^{i δ}, which expects δ in radians.

So, my earlier calculation was correct in terms of the values, but I should have converted the phase shifts to radians before computing sine.

Wait no, because when I computed sin(67 degrees), I already converted 67 degrees to radians, then took the sine in the calculator, which expects degrees if I didn't set it to radians mode. Wait, no, I used a calculator that gives the correct sine, regardless of units, but I have to ensure that the angle is in the correct unit.

Wait, I think in my initial calculation, I treated the phase shifts as degrees, which is correct, but the formula requires the angle to be in radians. So I should have converted the phase shifts from degrees to radians before computing their sines.

So, the correct approach is to convert each δ_l to radians, then compute sin^2 δ_l.

So let's recompute each term correctly.

Compute sin^2 δ for each l, but δ in radians.

l=0: δ0=90 degrees = π/2 rad → sin(π/2)=1 → sin^2=1.

l=1: δ1=67 degrees=1.16937 rad → sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205 → sin^2=0.8473.

l=2:55 degrees=0.95993 rad → sin(0.95993)= approx 0.8192 → sin^2=0.6710.

l=3:30 degrees=0.523599 rad → sin(0.523599)=0.5 → sin^2=0.25.

l=4:13 degrees=0.226893 rad → sin(0.226893)= approx 0.22495 → sin^2=0.0506.

So the same as before. So the sum remains 9.10245.

Wait, so converting degrees to radians doesn't change the sines because I already computed the correct values. So the sum is the same.

Hmm, so that doesn't explain the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps another mistake is in the formula. Maybe the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(k)) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

But I thought earlier steps were correct. So Im[f] is 9.10245 /k.

But with k=0.2535 fm^{-1}, Im[f]≈35.91 fm. But the options don't have this value.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ ... ]

Which would mean that f has a factor of 1/(2i), which, when taking the imaginary part, affects the result.

Wait, let me re-examine the formula.

f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (e^{2i δ} -1) (2l+1) ]

Expressed as:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ 2i e^{i δ} sin δ (2l+1) ]

So, f = (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

Which simplifies to (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

So, the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is actually f= (1/(k)) sum [ ... ]

But I'm using the correct formula.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, 355 is close to 359, but in my first calculation, I had Im[f]≈359 when k was 0.0253 fm^{-1}, which was the result of a mistake in unit conversion. But when I correctly converted units, I found k=0.2535 fm^{-1}, leading to Im[f]≈35.91 fm, which is not among the options.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k. Let me recompute k accurately using a correct approach.

Compute k = E/(ħ c)

E=50 MeV.

ħ c ≈ 197.327 MeV fm.

So,

k = 50 / 197.327 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So, Im[f] = sum /k →9.10245 /0.2535 ≈35.91 fm.

But the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are not for the same target or perhaps there's a missing factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the differential cross-section, but no, the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_l in radians, not degrees. But the question says degrees, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of (2l+1) and that the sum is over all l, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So perhaps the given phase shifts are the only non-zero ones. So I think I accounted for that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(k)) sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

But I'm using that. So Im[f] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ.

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ] without the 1/k factor. In that case, Im[f] would be sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ =9.10245. But 9.1 is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is ħ c/k, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ ... ]

Which would mean that f's imaginary part is (sum [ ... ] )/(2k), but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, let's re-express f correctly.

f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1) (2l+1) ]

As I did before.

Substituting e^{2i δ} -1 = 2i e^{i δ} sin δ:

f= (1/(2ik)) sum [ 2i e^{i δ} sin δ (2l+1) ]

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

= (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

Which is correct.

So Im[f] = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ ]

So with sum=9.10245 and k=0.2535 fm^{-1}:

Im[f] =9.10245 / 0.2535 ≈35.91 fm.

But none of the options are near that. 

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for the same l as the order. Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0, δ1, etc., which correspond to l=0,1,2,3,4.

So, the sum is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 2 or 1000. Alternatively, perhaps the units are in barns or mb, but the question says 'fm'.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Let's check.

If δ0=90 degrees, but if it's actually 90 radians, that would be impossible. So no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in units where sin(δ) is in a different unit, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l, not sin^2.

Wait, no, the formula for Im[f] is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, in some treatments, the scattering amplitude is written as f = sum ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (sin δ_l) ) / (k) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = sum ( (2l+1) (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} )

But that would give the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(k)) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) ]

But that would change the calculation.

Wait, let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the differential cross-section.

The differential cross-section is given by |f|^2, but the question is about the imaginary part of f, not the cross-section.

Wait, but the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of f.

σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f]

But that's about the total cross-section, not the imaginary part of f.

Wait, but the question asks for Im[f], not the cross-section.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the answer is 355.351 fm, which is option B, but according to my calculation, the correct value is 35.91 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as E/(ħ c), but with E in eV.

Let me compute k using E in eV:

E=50 MeV =5e7 eV.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm =1.97327e8 eV fm.

So,

k= E/(ħ c ) =5e7 eV /1.97327e8 eV fm = (5e7)/(1.97327e8) fm^{-1} ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are not all included. The question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so perhaps the given δ's are the only ones contributing. So I accounted for l=0 to l=4.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of f is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

No, that would give a different result.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for f includes a factor of (1/(2i)), which when taking the imaginary part, leads to a factor of 1/2.

Wait, no. Let's re-express:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ 2i e^{i δ} sin δ (2l+1) ]

= (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ ]

So, the imaginary part is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ ]

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2i)) sum [ ... ]

But no, the (1/(2i)) comes from the initial formula.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial formula. Let me check a reference.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the scattering amplitude in partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^infty ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l + 1) )/(2ik) ) P_l(cosθ)

So, when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1)(2l+1)

Which, when expanded, becomes (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum (e^{iδ} sin δ (2l+1)) 

Which simplifies to (1/k) sum (e^{iδ} sin δ (2l+1))

So, Im[f] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So, the correct approach is as I did, leading to Im[f]=35.91 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given as in the form where δ is the phase shift per unit of something else. Or perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f is f = sum ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ} sin δ ) /k.

In that case, Im[f] would be sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ *2.

Wait, but why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied by 2 somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is f = (1/(k)) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ )

Which is what I have.

So, I think the initial calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest is B) 355.351, but that's way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum with precise calculations.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90°)=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67°).

Compute sin(67°)=0.92050485345.

Squared:0.847305025.

Multiply by3:2.541915075.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°).

Multiply by5:3.3550760125.

Squared:0.050607035.

Multiply by9:0.455463315.

Sum:

1 +2.541915075 =3.541915075

+3.3550760125=6.8969910875

+1.75=8.6469910875

+0.455463315=9.1024544025.

Same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by 1e3, but that would make it 35,910 fm, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ ... ] → which would mean that Im[f] = (sum [ ... ]) / (2k).

In that case, Im[f] =9.10245/(2*0.2535) ≈9.10245/0.507≈17.96 fm.

Which is still not an option.

Wait, but option C is 177.675 fm, which is 17.96 *10. Perhaps there's a factor of 10 missing. Why would that be?

Ah! Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k. Let me check.

Wait, ħ c=197.327 MeV fm.

E=50 MeV.

k=E/(ħ c) →50 /197.327=0.2535 fm^{-1}.

But perhaps the correct formula uses E in GeV.

Wait, no, 50 MeV is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E in units of 10^6 eV.

Wait, no, that shouldn't matter.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on my calculation is approximately 35.9 fm, but it's not among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im[f] is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But that would give a much smaller number.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

So 13.382, which when divided by k=0.2535 gives Im[f]=13.382 /0.2535≈52.78 fm.

Still not matching any options.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, but I can't reconcile the calculated value with the options provided. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is B)355.351 fm, which is close to my initial miscalculation when I used k=0.0253 fm^{-1} instead of 0.2535.

Wait, perhaps the correct k is 0.0253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, how would I get that?

If I compute k via E/(ħ c) using E in eV and ħ c in eV fm.

E=50 MeV =5e7 eV.

ħ c=197.327 MeV fm=1.97327e8 eV fm.

So k=5e7 /1.97327e8 =0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Same as before.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with the calculation as per the correct formula, which gives Im[f]≈35.91 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B)355.351, which is ten times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of k, I made a mistake in units. Let me check.

Wait, E=50 MeV.

Compute k = E/(ħ c )

But ħ c is 197.327 MeV fm.

So,

k=50 MeV /197.327 MeV fm = 0.2535 fm^{-1}.

Yes.

Hmm.

In conclusion, based on the correct steps, the calculated value is approximately 35.9 fm, which is not among the options. However, the closest option is B)355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not certain.
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that in such experiments, electrons are fired at a target, and based on how they scatter, we can learn a lot about the target's structure.

The problem gives me phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67 degrees, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. And it says to ignore the rest, so I guess I only consider these up to δ4. The energy of the electrons is 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that's directly needed here.

Wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I think the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, often written as f(θ, k'), where θ is the scattering angle and k' is the momentum transfer. But the question is about the imaginary part. 

In the context of scattering theory, I recall that the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of the partial wave amplitudes. Each partial wave is associated with a phase shift δ_l. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f is a sum over l of ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) * exp(iδ_l - δ_l) * (sin δ_l) / (sin δ_l) ? Wait, maybe I should think again. 

Oh right, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(s, θ) = Σ [ (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) * e^{2iδ_l} * sin δ_l * P_l(cosθ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing some terms. Let me try to get this correctly. The scattering amplitude f can be written as:

f(s, θ) = Σ [ (2l+1) / (2ik) ) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ] * P_l(cosθ)

But wait, another version I remember is:

f(s, θ) = Σ [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) * ( sin δ_l ) / ( cos δ_l ) ) ] * P_l(cosθ)

No, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, the amplitude f is given by:

f = Σ [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] * P_l(cosθ)

Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Let's think about the optical theorem. The optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The forward direction is when θ=0. So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is related to the total cross-section. 

Wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. So, Im(f(0)).

The optical theorem states that 4π |f(0)|^2 = σ_total. But wait, that's the differential cross-section at θ=0. Alternatively, I think the imaginary part of f(0) is linked to the total cross-section. Let me check: the optical theorem says that 4π k Im f(0) = σ_total, where k is the wave number.

Wait, no. Let me think: the cross-section is given by |f|², but for small angles, the differential cross-section is |f|². But the total cross-section is the integral over all solid angles of |f|² multiplied by sinθ dθ dφ. Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the optical theorem says that 4π k Im f(0) = σ_total. So, if I can compute σ_total, I can get Im f(0).

But wait, do I have enough information to compute σ_total? Because the problem gives me the phase shifts. Alternatively, maybe I can compute Im(f(0)) directly from the partial wave expansion.

Because when θ=0, cosθ=1, and the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are 1 for all l. So each term in the sum becomes (2l+1)/(2ik) * (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * 1.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The expression for f is:

f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l( cosθ )

So at θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) =1. Therefore, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] 

And the imaginary part of f(0) is Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ]

Let me compute this. Let's factor out the 1/(2ik) term. So,

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * Im [ Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ] * (1/i)

Wait, because 1/(2ik) = (1/(2k)) * (1/i) = (1/(2k)) * (-i), since 1/i = -i.

Wait, I think I'll need to compute Im(f(0)).

Let me compute the sum first. For each l, compute (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1). Then sum them. Then take the imaginary part, multiply by (1/(2ik)), and that gives Im(f(0)).

Wait, but f is (1/(2ik)) times the sum. So f is a complex quantity, and Im(f(0)) is the imaginary part of that.

Wait, another approach: since f(0) is a sum, let's compute each term's imaginary part and sum them.

Each term in f(0) is [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ]

Let me compute this for each l.

Let me denote each term as term_l = (2l+1)/(2ik) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

So, Im(term_l) is the imaginary part of term_l.

e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{2iδ} = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ).

So e^{2iδ} -1 = [cos(2δ) - 1] + i sin(2δ)

So, e^{2iδ} -1 = -2 sin²(δ) + i 2 sinδ cosδ.

Wait, because cos(2δ) = 1 - 2 sin² δ, so cos(2δ) -1 = -2 sin² δ. And sin(2δ)=2 sinδ cosδ. So e^{2iδ} -1 = -2 sin² δ + i 2 sinδ cosδ.

So, (e^{2iδ} -1) = 2 sinδ [ - sin δ + i cos δ ]

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ} -1 )/(2ik), multiplied by (2l+1).

Alternatively, term_l = (2l+1)/(2ik) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So term_l can be written as (2l+1)/(2ik) [ (cos(2δ_l)-1) ) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So, term_l = (2l+1)/(2ik) [ A + i B ]

Where A = cos(2δ_l) -1, and B = sin(2δ_l).

So, term_l = (2l+1)/(2ik) (A + i B )

Now, the imaginary part of term_l is the imaginary part of [ (2l+1)/(2ik) (A + i B) ]

Let me compute this. Let's factor out (2l+1)/(2ik):

Im(term_l) = Im [ (2l+1)/(2ik) (A + i B) ]

Multiply the terms:

(2l+1)/(2ik) * A + (2l+1)/(2ik) * i B

= (2l+1) A/(2ik) + (2l+1) i B/(2ik)

Simplify each term.

First term: (2l+1) A/(2ik) → (2l+1) A/(2ik)

Second term: (2l+1) i B/(2ik) → (2l+1) B/(2k)

Because i/(i k) = 1/k.

So, combining, Im(term_l) is [ (2l+1) B/(2k) ].

Because the first term is real? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have a complex number multiplied by i, the imaginary part is the real part after multiplication, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's approach it more carefully.

The entire term_l is (2l+1)/(2ik) * (A + i B). So,

term_l = (2l+1)/(2ik) * A + (2l+1)/(2ik) * i B

= (2l+1) A/(2ik) + (2l+1) i B/(2ik)

Simplify each part:

First part: (2l+1) A/(2ik) = (2l+1) A/(2i k) → which is (2l+1) [A/(2i)] * (1/k)

Second part: (2l+1) i B/(2ik) = (2l+1) [i B/(2i k) ) ] → i cancels, so it's (2l+1) B/(2k)

So the second part is real, because B is real.

The first part is imaginary, because A/(2i) is (A/(2i)) = (-i A)/2. So the first term becomes (2l+1) (-i A)/ (2k)

Wait, but I'm trying to compute the imaginary part of term_l.

So term_l is:

= (2l+1) (-i A)/(2k) + (2l+1) B/(2k )

Which can be written as [ (2l+1) B/(2k) ) ] + i [ (2l+1) (-A)/(2k) ) ]

So the imaginary part of term_l is (2l+1) (-A)/(2k)

But A is cos(2δ_l) -1, which is negative because cos(2δ) is less than or equal to 1. So -A is 1 - cos(2δ_l).

So Im(term_l) = (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l)) / (2k )

Wait, but wait, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i in term_l. So yes, Im(term_l) = (2l+1) ( - (cos(2δ_l) -1) ) / (2k )

Which simplifies to (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l)) / (2k )

Alternatively, using the identity 1 - cos(2δ) = 2 sin² δ.

So 1 - cos(2δ) = 2 sin² δ.

Therefore, Im(term_l) = (2l+1) * 2 sin² δ_l / (2k )

Simplify, the 2s cancel:

Im(term_l) = (2l+1) sin² δ_l / k

So, for each l, the imaginary part of term_l is (2l+1) sin² δ_l / k

Thus, the total Im(f(0)) is the sum of Im(term_l) for all l considered.

So, Im(f(0)) = Σ [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / k

Now, let's look at the phase shifts given. The phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

Wait, but in scattering theory, the phase shifts are typically denoted with l as a subscript, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So δ0 is l=0, δ1 is l=1, etc.

So the sum goes from l=0 to l=4, as the phase shifts up to δ4 are given.

So, for each l from 0 to 4:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1, δ0=90°
l=1: 3, δ1=67
l=2:5, δ2=55
l=3:7, δ3=30
l=4:9, δ4=13

So compute for each l:

(2l+1) * sin² δ_l

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90°) → sin(90)=1 → 1 *1 =1
l=1:3 * sin²(67) → sin(67)=approx 0.9205 → (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.8473 → 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419
l=2:5 * sin²(55) → sin(55)=approx 0.8192 → (0.8192)^2≈0.6710 →5 *0.6710 ≈3.355
l=3:7 * sin²(30) → sin(30)=0.5 → 0.5^2=0.25 → 7 * 0.25=1.75
l=4:9 * sin²(13°) → sin(13)= approx 0.22495 → square is ~0.0506 → 9 *0.0506≈0.4554

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 1
l=1: ~2.5419
l=2: ~3.355
l=3: 1.75
l=4: ~0.4554

Adding them up:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419
3.5419 +3.355 =6.8969
6.8969 +1.75=8.6469
8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023

So the total numerator is approximately 9.1023.

Now, divide by k.

But what is k?

k is the wave number. The electrons are of energy 50 MeV. I need to find k in units that make sense, probably in fm^{-1} because the options are in fm.

The wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p/ħ. But for non-relativistic particles, p ≈ sqrt(2m E).

Wait, but 50 MeV is a relativistic energy for electrons. Wait, electrons have rest mass of about 0.511 MeV. So 50 MeV is much higher than that, so relativistic effects are significant.

In high-energy physics, the relation between the kinetic energy and the momentum is p = sqrt(2 m E) for non-relativistic, but that's not applicable here. For relativistic particles, the energy E is given by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, the total energy E is 50 MeV. So,

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2

So, p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c

But units can be tricky. Let me make sure I get the units right.

But perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of the wavelength.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ), where p is the momentum.

But let's compute p in units that make sense. Let's use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But perhaps it's easier to compute in SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula to compute k for a given energy.

Wait, the Compton wavelength of an electron is about 2.426 fm. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2m E) / ħ, but that's the non-relativistic formula. For E >> m c², it's relativistic, so we need the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, the expression for k in terms of energy can be found by:

k = sqrt( (E/(ħc))² - (m_e c²/(ħ c))² ) 

Wait, E is given in MeV, so let me compute in units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, E = 50 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt( (E/(ħ c))^2 - (m_e c²/(ħ c))^2 )

m_e c² is the rest energy of the electron, about 0.511 MeV.

So,

(E/(ħ c)) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 MeV^{-1}?

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, E in MeV. (E/(ħc)) is in (MeV)/(MeV fm) ) → 1/fm.

So, 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV fm = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Similarly, (m_e c² / ħ c) = 0.511 MeV / 197.33 MeV fm = 0.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.00259 fm^{-1}.

So, k = sqrt( (0.253)^2 - (0.00259)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.064) ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, because 0.253^2 is about 0.064, and (0.00259)^2 is about 0.0000067, which is negligible. So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So, k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in the formula, E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy.

Wait, no. Because E is given as 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy? Or the total energy?

Wait, the problem says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons". I think in such contexts, it's the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm, this could be a point of confusion.

Wait, if E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy is E_total = K + m c².

But if E is the total energy, then it's just E.

So, which is it?

The question says "50 MeV electrons". Hmm, in particle physics, when they say "50 MeV electrons", they usually refer to their kinetic energy. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, they might mean their total energy, which would be much higher.

Wait, if the electrons have a kinetic energy of 50 MeV, then their total energy E is K + m c² = 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So, similar to before, but let me compute that.

If K =50 MeV, E =50.511 MeV.

So,

E/(ħc) = 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm^{-1}

m c^2/(ħc) = 0.511 /197.33 ≈ 0.00259 fm^{-1}

Thus,

k = sqrt( (0.256)^2 - (0.00259)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0656) ≈ 0.256 fm^{-1}.

Which is roughly the same as before, because the rest mass term is negligible compared to the kinetic energy.

So, k ≈ 0.256 fm^-1.

So, going back, Im(f(0)) = (sum terms) /k ≈ 9.1023 / 0.256 fm^-1.

Wait, what's the unit? Because sum is unitless, k is in fm^-1. So, [Im(f(0))] = (unitless)/(fm^-1) ) = fm.

So, 9.1023 / 0.256 ≈ 35.53 fm.

Wait, that's approximately 35.53 fm.

Looking at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 35.53 isn't among the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the sum. Let me compute each term again more accurately.

Compute (2l+1) sin² δ_l for each l:

l=0: (1) sin²(90) → 1 * 1 =1 → 1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67 degrees). Let's compute sin(67) more accurately.

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205048534.

So sin^2 ≈ (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.8473.

3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²(55°) → sin(55)=0.8191520443.

sin²≈0.6710.

5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²(30°)=7 * (0.5)^2=7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.2249510543. So sin²≈0.0506.

9 * 0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum all:

1 + 2.5419 =3.5419

+3.355 →6.8969

+1.75 →8.6469

+0.4554 →9.1023.

Same as before.

So, 9.1023 / 0.256 ≈ 35.53 fm.

But none of the options are near that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Because in my calculation, I assumed that Im(f(0)) = [Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l] / k.

But I might have missed a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, in the earlier steps, I had:

Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / k.

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula has a factor of 2 in there.

Wait, going back to the expression for Im(term_l):

Im(term_l) = (2l+1) sin² δ_l / k.

But wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 because in the expansion of e^{i2δ} -1, the imaginary part could have a factor.

Wait, let's re-calculate the Im(term_l):

Earlier, I had:

Im(term_l) = (2l+1) sin² δ_l / k.

But perhaps I should have considered that term_l is (2l+1)/(2ik) (e^{2iδ} -1).

So, let me re-express term_l as (2l+1)/(2ik) (e^{2iδ} -1).

Then, e^{2iδ} -1 = 2i sin δ e^{iδ}.

Wait, that's a different approach. Because e^{iθ} -1 = 2i sin(θ/2) e^{iθ/2}.

So, e^{2iδ} -1 = 2i sin δ e^{iδ}.

So, term_l = (2l+1)/(2ik) * 2i sin δ e^{iδ}

Simplify:

The 2 and 2i in numerator and denominator:

term_l = (2l+1) * i sin δ e^{iδ} / k

e^{iδ} = cos δ + i sin δ.

So, e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ.

So,

term_l = (2l+1) i sin δ (cos δ + i sin δ ) /k

Multiply it out:

= (2l+1) [ i sin δ cos δ + i^2 sin² δ ] /k

= (2l+1) [ i sin δ cos δ - sin² δ ] /k

So, term_l has real and imaginary parts.

Im(term_l) is the coefficient of i.

So, Im(term_l) = (2l+1) sin δ cos δ /k.

Wait, that's different from before. So, earlier method was incorrect.

So, the correct Im(term_l) is (2l+1) sin δ cos δ /k.

But wait, wait, because the imaginary part is the coefficient of i in term_l.

So, term_l = (2l+1) [ - sin² δ + i sin δ cos δ ] / k

So, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin δ cos δ / k.

So, Im(f(0)) is the sum of these.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ] / k

Which can be written as sum [ (2l+1) (sin(2 δ_l) ) / 2 ] /k.

Because sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ → sinθ cosθ = sin(2θ)/2.

So,

Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) / 2 ] / k

= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] / (2k )

Ah, that's different. So I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. The correct formula is Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

So, let's recalculate using this correct formula.

So, for each l, compute (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), sum them, then divide by (2k )

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(2*90°) = sin(180°)=0 → term=0.

l=1: 3 * sin(2*67°) → 2*67=134°, sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)=approx 0.7193.

So 3 * 0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(2*55°)=5*sin(110°). 110° is 180-70, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60°)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

Because 2*30=60°, sin(60)=√3/2 ≈0.8660.

l=4:9 * sin(26°)=9 * sin(26). Sin(26)≈0.4384.

9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum all these:

l=0: 0.

l=1:2.1579

l=2:4.6985

l=3:6.062 → sum so far: 2.1579+4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184.

l=4:3.9456 → total sum =12.9184 +3.9456 =16.864.

So, sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) is approximately 16.864.

Now, divide by (2k):

k=0.256 fm^{-1} as computed earlier.

2k=0.512 fm^{-1}.

So, Im(f(0))=16.864 / 0.512 ≈32.93 fm.

Hmm, that's approximately 32.93 fm.

Looking at the options, again, none match this. The closest is option B: 355.35 fm, which is much larger.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k.

Wait, because in the first approach I thought k was about 0.256 fm⁻¹, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let's recalculate k correctly.

E is the kinetic energy, 50 MeV. So the total energy E_total = 50 + 0.511 ≈50.511 MeV.

Compute p (momentum):

Using relativistic formula,

E_total² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E_total² - (m c²)^2.

So,

p c = sqrt( E_total² - (m c²)^2 )

E_total in MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So,

pc = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ 50.511 MeV → since (50.511)^2 is much larger than (0.511)^2.

So,

p c ≈50.511 MeV → p =50.511 / c MeV.

But since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm,

p = (50.511 MeV) / (c) → but to get p in units of MeV/c, since p c =50.511 MeV.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k= p/(ħ).

p = (50.511 MeV/c ) / c → because p c =50.511 MeV → p=50.511 MeV/c² → wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting confused with units. Let me compute p in terms of MeV/c.

So, p c =50.511 MeV → p =50.511 MeV/c.

Now, k = p / ħ.

But ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in units of 1/fm.

So,

k = p / ħ → since p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV fm /c.

Wait, let me write the units:

p =50.511 MeV/c.

ħ has units MeV fm.

So, k = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (c / (fm)) → no, perhaps I should think in terms of unit conversion.

Alternatively, since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

So,

p = (50.511 MeV/c)

k = p/(ħ) → (50.511 MeV/c ) / ( 197.33 MeV fm / c ) )

The c cancels, and MeV cancels. So,

k =50.511 / 197.33 (1/fm)

≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

Same as before. So, k is 0.256 fm⁻¹.

So, 2k = 0.512 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=16.864 / 0.512 ≈32.93 fm.

But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the phase shifts.

Wait, for l=0, δ0=90°, so 2δ0=180°, sin(180)=0. So that term is zero.

What about for l=3, 2δ3=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.866.

So 7 *0.866≈6.062. Correct.

l=2: 2δ2=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397. 5 *0.9397≈4.6985. Correct.

l=1: 2δ1=134°, sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193. So 3 *0.7193≈2.1579. Correct.

l=4:2δ4=26°, sin(26)=0.4384 →9*0.4384≈3.9456. Correct.

Sum:0 + 2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456=16.864.

Hmm, correct.

So, Im(f(0))=16.864 / (2 *0.256 ) → 16.864 /0.512≈32.93 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in another part.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the phase shifts as given, but perhaps the problem uses the approximation that higher l terms are negligible, but the problem says to ignore rest, so only up to δ4.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is not 0.256, but larger.

Wait, another approach: compute the wavelength λ, then k=2π/λ. Because in scattering, the wave number is 2π/λ.

But E=50 MeV.

Wait, the wavelength of an electron with energy E is given by λ = h / p.

But p = sqrt(2mE) in non-relativistic, but relativistic for high energies.

But perhaps using the relativistic formula:

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

So, p = sqrt( (50 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / c.

Which is ≈50 MeV/c.

So, λ = h/(p) → h=6.582e-25 GeV·s → but perhaps better to use MeV·fm.

Wait, Planck's constant h=6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since ħc=197.33 MeV fm,

So, λ = h/(p) = 2π ħ /p → because h=2π ħ.

So, λ= 2π ħ / p.

But p=50 MeV/c.

So,

λ= (2π * 197.33 MeV fm) / (50 MeV/c) ) * (1/c) )

Wait, perhaps better to compute k= 2π/(λ) → k= p/(ħ).

Wait, since k= p/(ħ), and we have p=50 MeV/c.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ=197.33 MeV fm / c.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

Hmm. So, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem says that 4π k Im f(0) = σ_total.

But I don't have σ_total given. So how can I proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else.

Wait, but the options are in the range of hundreds of fm, which is way larger than what I computed, 32 fm.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the Born approximation, where the phase shifts are considered small, but in this case, δ0=90°, which is not small. So that approach is probably not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the differential cross-section at θ=0, which is |f(0)|^2.

Wait, but the problem specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(0). Let me re-express f(0).

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

So, the imaginary part is Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ ... ]

Let me compute it as:

Im [ (1/(2ik)) * S ] where S is the sum.

So, 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So,

Im [ (-i/(2k)) * S ] → i is imaginary.

Multiplying by -i/(2k) is equivalent to rotating the complex plane by 90 degrees and scaling.

So, the imaginary part is:

Im [ (-i/(2k)) S ] = (1/(2k)) Re [ S ]

Because multiplying by i (or -i) rotates the complex number, so the real part becomes the imaginary part after this operation.

So, Im [ (-i/(2k)) S ] = (1/(2k)) Re [ S ]

Thus,

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Re [ Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ]

But Re [ e^{2iδ} -1 ] = Re [ e^{i2δ} ] - Re [1 ] → cos(2δ) -1.

So,

Re [ Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] = Σ (2l+1)( cos(2δ_l) -1 )

So,

Im(f(0)) = [ Σ (2l+1)( cos(2δ_l) -1 ) ] / (2k )

Hmm, let me compute this.

Compute for each l:

l=0: 1*(cos(180) -1)=1*(-1 -1)= -2.

l=1:3*(cos(134)-1) → cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.6947.

So cos(134) ≈-0.6947. So cos(134) -1 =-1.6947 → 3*(-1.6947)= -5.0841.

l=2:5*(cos(110) -1) → cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= -0.3420.

So cos(110)-1= -1.3420 →5*(-1.3420)= -6.71.

l=3:7*(cos(60)-1)=7*(0.5 -1)=7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

l=4:9*(cos(26)-1) → cos(26)=0.8988 → cos(26)-1= -0.1012 →9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.

Now sum all terms:

l=0: -2

l=1: -5.0841 → sum so far: -7.0841

l=2: -6.71 → sum: -13.7941

l=3: -3.5 → sum: -17.2941

l=4: -0.9108 → sum: -18.2049

So, sum is approximately -18.2049.

Then Im(f(0)) = (-18.2049) / (2k ) → (-18.2049)/(2 *0.256 ) →-18.2049/(0.512)= approx -35.53 fm.

But the imaginary part can be negative. However, in the options, all are positive.

Wait, but the question is probably asking for the magnitude, but I'm not sure.

But what's important is that the options don't have 35.53, but option B is 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck.

Wait, for l=1: cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.69465837. So cos(134)-1= -1.69465837. Multiply by 3: 3 * (-1.69465837)= -5.08397511.

l=2: cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= -0.3420201433.

cos(110)-1= -1.3420201433. Multiply by 5: 5*(-1.3420201433)= -6.710100717.

l=3: cos(60)=0.5. cos(60)-1= -0.5. Multiply by7: 7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

l=4: cos(26)=0.8987940463 → cos(26)-1= -0.1012059537. Multiply by9: 9*(-0.1012059537)= -0.9108535833.

Sum all:

-2 (l=0) 
-5.08397511 (l=1) → sum: -7.08397511
-6.710100717 (l=2) → sum: -13.79407583
-3.5 (l=3) → sum: -17.29407583
-0.9108535833 (l=4) → sum: -18.20492941.

So, sum is -18.20492941.

Thus, Im(f(0))= (-18.20492941)/(2 *0.256 )= -18.20492941/0.512≈-35.53 fm.

But the options are positive, so perhaps I'm supposed to take the magnitude, 35.53 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, I'm getting Im(f(0)) as approximately 35.5 fm. But the options given are B) 355.351, which is 10 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Did I miscalculate some term?

Wait, for l=3, 7*(cos(60) -1)=7*(0.5-1)=7*(-0.5)= -3.5. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include some terms. The problem statement says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4.

So, the sum is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in the first approach, when I thought Im(f(0)) was 35.53, but the correct formula after another approach gives me Im(f(0))=35.53.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, which can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have considered that the amplitude f is given in terms of the scattering length, which for electrons is in units of fm. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts and find the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Σ [ (2l+1) ( sin(2δ_l) ) ]

Wait, that was the formula I used earlier, which gave me 32.93 fm.

But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the real part instead of the imaginary part? No, the question says imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the total cross-section and then use the optical theorem.

Wait, from the optical theorem, 4π k Im f(0) = σ_total.

But I don't have σ_total given, but perhaps I can compute it from the phase shifts.

The total cross-section can be computed using the formula:

σ_total = Σ [ (2l+1) ( 1 - cos(2δ_l) ) ] /k².

Wait, let me think. Another formula for the total cross-section is:

σ_total = Σ [ (2l+1) ( 1 - cos(2δ_l) ) ] /k².

Yes, I think that's correct.

So, σ_total = Σ [ (2l+1) ( 1 - cos(2δ_l) ) ] / (k^2 )

So, compute each term (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l)), sum them, then divide by k².

Compute each term:

l=0: 1*(1 - cos(180°)) =1*(1 - (-1))=2.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(134°)) → cos(134)≈-0.6947 →1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947 →3 *1.6947≈5.0841.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(110)) → cos(110)= -0.3420 →1 - (-0.3420)=1.3420 →5 *1.3420≈6.71.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(60)) → cos(60)=0.5 →1-0.5=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(26)) → cos(26)=0.8988 →1-0.8988=0.1012 →9*0.1012≈0.9108.

Now sum all:

2 +5.0841=7.0841

+6.71=13.7941

+3.5=17.2941

+0.9108=18.2049.

So, sum is 18.2049.

Now, k=0.256 fm⁻¹ → k²= (0.256)^2 =0.065536 fm⁻².

So,

σ_total=18.2049 / 0.065536 fm² → 18.2049 /0.065536 ≈277.8 fm².

Then, from the optical theorem, 4π k Im f(0) = σ_total → Im f(0)= σ_total/(4π k )

So,

Im f(0)= 277.8 / (4 * π * 0.256 )

Compute denominator: 4 * π ≈12.566 → 12.566 *0.256≈3.214.

So,

Im f(0)= 277.8 /3.214 ≈86.39 fm.

Again, not matching the options.

Hmm. None of these approaches are getting a value close to the options provided. The options are A) ~8.7e4 fm, B) ~355 fm, C) ~177 fm, D) ~251 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, earlier I computed k as approximately 0.256 fm⁻¹. But if the electron's energy is 50 MeV, which is much larger than its rest mass, so relativistic.

Wait, let's compute k accurately.

E = 50 MeV (kinetic), so total energy E_total =50 +0.511 =50.511 MeV.

Relativistic energy: E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

So,

p = sqrt( (50.511 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / c.

≈50.511 MeV /c.

Now, ħ c =197.327 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ → (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.327 MeV fm) * (c) → units: 1/fm.

Wait, 50.511 /197.327 ≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the wave number k is actually 1/(wavelength), but perhaps I should compute the de Broglie wavelength.

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p.

h= Planck's constant=6.582e-25 GeV·s → but not sure.

Alternatively, using λ = 2π / k.

Wait, but I have k in fm⁻¹, so λ=2π/k fm.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by (2k), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let's try to compute using the first formula I used.

In the first approach, I thought that Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] /k.

Which gave me 9.1023 / 0.256 ≈35.53 fm.

But none of the options match. So, perhaps the correct answer is 35.5 fm, but it's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I should convert them to radians before computing the sine.

Yes! That's a crucial point. Because in all the calculations above, I treated the angles as degrees, but in reality, the trigonometric functions in physics are often computed in radians.

Oh my god, I think this is the mistake.

Let me recompute the sum using radians.

So, for each l:

Compute δ_l in radians, then compute sin(2δ_l) in radians.

Let's recalculate the sum for Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

So,

l=0: δ0=90°= π/2 radians → 2δ0= π radians. sin(π)=0 → term=0.

l=1: δ1=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

2δ1=2.33875 radians. sin(2.33875)= compute sin(2.33875)= approx 0.724.

So 3 * 0.724 ≈2.172.

l=2: δ2=55° →55 * π/180≈0.95993 radians.

2δ2=1.91986 radians. sin(1.91986)= approx 0.945.

5 *0.945=4.725.

l=3: δ3=30° →30 * π/180= π/6=0.523599 radians.

2δ3=1.047198 radians. sin(1.047198)=0.8660.

7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ4=13° →13 * π/180≈0.226893 radians.

2δ4=0.453786 radians. sin(0.453786)≈0.4384.

9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum these terms:

l=0:0.

l=1:2.172.

l=2:4.725 → sum so far:6.897.

l=3:6.062 → sum:12.959.

l=4:3.9456 → sum:16.9046.

So, sum=16.9046.

Now, Im(f(0))=16.9046/(2k )=16.9046/(2*0.256 )=16.9046/0.512≈32.93 fm.

Wait, same as before, but now in radians. So same result.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts were given in radians, but the problem states degrees. So this shouldn't be the issue.

But wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula.

Wait, another approach.

The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, k) = Σ [ (2l+1)/(2ik) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ) ]

The imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) sin(2δ_l) /2.

Because, e^{2iδ} -1 = 2i sin δ e^{iδ} → Im( (e^{2iδ}-1) ) = 2 sin δ cos δ = sin(2δ).

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / 2.

Which simplifies to:

Im(f(0))= [ Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (4k )

Wait, that's different.

Wait, no, let's think again.

Each term in f(0) is (2l+1)/(2ik) (e^{2iδ} -1 )

The imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * Im( e^{2iδ} -1 )

Im( e^{2iδ} -1 ) = Im( e^{2iδ} ) - Im(1) = sin(2δ) -0 = sin(2δ).

So, the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)/(2k ) * sin(2δ )

So, Im(f(0)) is the sum of these, which is:

Σ [ (2l+1) sin(2δ) ] * (1/(2k )) 

So,

Im(f(0))= [ Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

So, same as earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, but if I use this formula, and the sum is 16.9046, k=0.256, then Im(f(0))=16.9046/(2*0.256)=16.9046/0.512≈32.93 fm.

But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part? No, the question says imaginary.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the value in a different unit, like barns or something. But the options are in fm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the scattering length a, which is given by a = 1/(k f(0) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that sin(2δ) ≈ 2δ for small δ, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, for l=1, δ=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134°)=sin(46°)=0.7193.

So 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:55°, 2δ=110°, sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:60°, sin=0.866 →7*0.866=6.062.

l=4:26°, sin=0.4384 →9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Ah, using degrees, the sum is 16.864.

Wait, but earlier when I converted to radians, the sum was 16.9046. So, the difference is minor.

So,

Im(f(0))=16.864/(2 *0.256 )=16.864/0.512≈32.93 fm.

Hmm, but this is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is not 0.256, but higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use the momentum in a different way.

Wait, the relativistic energy equation:

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

But E is given as 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. So the total energy E_total=50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

So,

p =50.511 MeV / c.

So,

k= p / ħ = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (c) → because ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k= (50.511) /197.33 (1/fm ) → 0.256 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Given that, I'm not sure why the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the amplitude multiplied by k, or some other factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the amplitude is in units of fm, but the imaginary part is calculated as Im(f) in fm.

Wait, but f is typically dimensionless, but in scattering, sometimes it's expressed in units of fm⁻¹.

Wait, but in the calculation, the units worked out to fm for Im(f(0)).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, such as f= -i [sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l) ] / (2k ), which would be a different result.

Wait, for example, if f= -i [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Then Im(f)= [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k )

Compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1*sin90=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5*sin55≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin13≈9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

So sum≈13.38205.

Im(f)=13.38205/(2k )=13.38205/(2*0.256 )=13.38205/0.512≈26.13 fm.

Which is close to option D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, but 26 is not 251. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k.

So,

Im(f)=13.38205/0.256≈52.27 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * k.

Then,

52.27 *0.256=13.38 fm.

No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/k ).

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 35.5 fm.

Hmm.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 35.5 fm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach leads to option C) 177.675 fm, which is roughly double of 88.8, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the sum with the correct approach.

Wait, the correct formula is:

Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

Which, using l=0 to 4, and δ in degrees, gives sum=16.864.

k=0.256 fm⁻¹.

So,

Im(f(0))=16.864/(2*0.256 )=16.864/0.512≈32.93 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the phases are δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13.

Wait, perhaps the l indices are shifted. For example, perhaps δ0 corresponds to l=1, which would change the (2l+1) factors.

Wait, no, the problem says phase shifts δ0, δ1, etc., which are for l=0,1,2,3,4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition, like f = sum (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) * P_l(cosθ )

Which is the standard formula. So, perhaps the imaginary part is indeed 35.5 fm, but it's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of k again.

E=50 MeV (kinetic). E_total=50.511 MeV.

p c= sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 )=50.511 MeV.

So, p=50.511 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ )=50.511 /197.33 fm⁻¹ → 0.256 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps ħ c=197.33 MeV fm is incorrect. Let me double-check.

Yes, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, but sometimes ħ c is given as 197.33 MeV·fm, correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck because the calculated value doesn't match any of the options. But given the options, perhaps the intended approach was to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) and then multiply by something else.

Wait, let me think: 35.53 fm is approximately option C) 177.675 /5. But I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the formula used in the problem is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l) ), which would give Im(f)= [sum (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ)) ]/(2k )

Wait, let's compute this sum.

For each l:

l=0:1*(1 - cos(180))=1*(1 - (-1))=2.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(134)) → cos(134)= -0.6947 →1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947 →3*1.6947=5.0841.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(110)) →cos(110)= -0.3420 →1 - (-0.3420)=1.3420 →5 *1.3420=6.71.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(60)) →7*(1-0.5)=3.5.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(26)) →cos(26)=0.8988 →1-0.8988=0.1012 →9 *0.1012=0.9108.

Sum: 2 +5.0841=7.0841 +6.71=13.7941 +3.5=17.2941 +0.9108=18.2049.

Im(f)=18.2049/(2k )=18.2049/(2*0.256 )=18.2049/0.512≈35.53 fm.

Which brings me back to the same result.

Hmm.

Given that, I think perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately (35.53 *5) =177.65. But I can't think of why to multiply by 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave number k was computed using the rest energy, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute the sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4, using degrees.

l=0:1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 * sin(46)=3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 * sin(70)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864. So same as before.

Thus, Im(f)=16.864/(2k )=16.864/(2 *0.256 )=32.93 fm.

Hmm.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the differential cross-section at 0 degrees, which is |f(0)|².

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the real part. Let me try.

Real part of f(0) is Re [ (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) ]

= Re [ (1/(2ik)) S ]

= Re [ (-i/(2k )) S ]

Which is equal to (1/(2k )) Im [ S ]

Because multiplying by -i is equivalent to rotating the complex number by 90 degrees, so the real part becomes the imaginary part.

So,

Re(f(0))= (1/(2k )) Im [ Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ} -1 ) ]

Which is (1/(2k )) [ sum (2l+1) (2 sin δ cos δ ) ]

Which is same as Im(f(0)) formula.

So, Re(f)= Im(f) as per earlier.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula where the amplitude is multiplied by k, so Im(k f(0)).

Then, Im(k f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ) ] / 2.

Which would be 16.864 /2 =8.432.

But that's not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ) ] / (2 )

Which would be 16.864/2=8.432.

Not matching.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem intended to use each term's contribution as (2l+1) sin δ_l, then sum and multiply by something.

But I don't see how that leads to the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (1/k ) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be sum (2l+1) sin δ =1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.22495.

As earlier,

1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455=1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.382.

So,

Im(f)=13.382 /0.256≈52.27 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * k.

Which would be 13.382 *0.256≈3.423 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k^2 )

Which would be 13.382 / (0.256)^2=13.382 /0.065536≈204.13 fm.

Close to option D) 251.271, but not exact.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum using the real part.

Wait, if I compute the real part of f(0), which is Re(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ) -1 ) ]/(2k )

Which we computed earlier as -18.2049/(2*0.256 )= -35.53 fm.

But the question is about the imaginary part.

At this point, I think I might have to concede that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

But looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is roughly twice 88.8375.

Wait, 88.8375 * 2 is 177.675. So if my sum was 16.864 and I multiplied by 10, I get 168.64. Close to option C.

But I don't see a reason to multiply by 10.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the wave number in units of 1/(fm), and if k=0.256 fm⁻¹, then 1/k is ~3.906 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) and then multiply by (1/(2k)).

Which gives 16.864/(2*0.256 )=32.93 fm.

But none of the options match.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 35.53 *5.

But I can't find a justification for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

If the energy is 50 MeV (kinetic), then E_total=50.511 MeV.

p c= sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 )=50.511 MeV.

k= p/(ħ )=50.511 /197.33 fm⁻¹≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the energy given is the total energy, not the kinetic. So E=50 MeV is the total energy.

So, E_total=50 MeV.

p c= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=49.998≈50 MeV.

So k=50 /197.33≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't find a way to get one of the given options. However, based on the earlier calculation, the correct value is approximately 35.5 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is exactly 5 times 35.53.

But I don't know why to multiply by 5.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, which was 13.382, and then multiplied by 13.382/(2k )=13.382/(2*0.256 )=26.13 fm.

Again, not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula Im(f)= (1/(2k )) Σ (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l) )

Which would be Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ)) ]/(2k )=18.2049/(2*0.256 )=35.53 fm.

But again, not an option.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should conclude that the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure how to reach it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the scattering amplitude f is in units of fm, and the imaginary part is given as Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k )

So, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.382.

Im(f)=13.382/(2*0.256 )=13.382/0.512≈26.13 fm.

Still not C.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * k.

So, 13.382 * 0.256≈3.423 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/k )

Which is 13.382 /0.256≈52.27 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Given that, I think the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, but I can't see a logical path to reach it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) sin(δ_l), not 2δ_l.

So,

sum (2l+1)* sin δ_l:

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5* sin55≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7* sin30=3.5.

l=4:9* sin13≈9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Then,

Im(f)=13.382/(2k )=13.382/(2*0.256 )≈26.13 fm.

Not matching options.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all possible approaches. Perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 5 times the calculated value of 35.53 fm. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) and then multiply by 5, leading to 16.864 *5=84.32, but still not an option.

Given that, I'll have to select the closest option, but none seems to fit. However, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times 35.53, but again, I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] /k .

So,

Im(f)=16.864/0.256≈65.89 fm.

Still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] *k.

16.864 *0.256≈4.318 fm.

No.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but based on the initial calculation, the closest possible is 35.5 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion formula for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(\theta = 0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i \delta_l} \sin \delta_l
\]

The imaginary part of \( f \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \((2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). Converting these to radians and calculating \(\sin^2 \delta_l\) for each \( l \):

- \( l = 0 \): \((2(0) + 1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \( l = 1 \): \((2(1) + 1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 = 2.5419\)
- \( l = 2 \): \((2(2) + 1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 = 3.3551\)
- \( l = 3 \): \((2(3) + 1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, the problem involves using the given phase shifts and the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves. The scattering amplitude \( f(0) \) at the forward direction (\( \theta = 0 \)) is expressed as:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \left( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts. The imaginary part of \( f(0) \), denoted as \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), is derived from the imaginary components of the partial wave contributions. The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) simplifies to:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Key Calculations:
1. **Phase Shifts and Contributions**:  
   The given phase shifts are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). For each \( l \), the term \( (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \) is computed:
   - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.7193 = 2.1579 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456 \).

   Summing these contributions gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864.
   \]

2. **Wave Number \( k \)**:  
   The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic energy relation:
   \[
   k = \frac{p}{\hbar}, \quad p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{c},
   \]
   where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) (total energy), \( m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), and \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \). Substituting:
   \[
   k \approx \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.256 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

3. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:  
   Substituting the sum and \( k \) into the formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.256} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.512} \approx 32.93 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 87163.4 \, \text{fm} \))**: This is orders of magnitude larger than the calculated value and is not plausible.
- **Option B (\( 355.351 \, \text{fm} \))**: This is approximately 10 times the calculated value of \( 32.93 \, \text{fm} \), but there is no justification for this scaling factor.
- **Option C (\( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \))**: This is approximately 5 times the calculated value, but again, there is no clear justification for this scaling.
- **Option D (\( 251.271 \, \text{fm} \))**: This is closer to the calculated value but does not match exactly.

### Conclusion:
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is approximately \( 32.93 \, \text{fm} \), which does not match any of the provided options. However, based on the closest match and possible rounding, **Option C (\( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \))** is selected as the most likely intended answer, though the reasoning for the discrepancy remains unclear.

Answer: C
