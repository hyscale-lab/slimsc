Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

First, I think I need to recall what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Since the solvent is condensed ammonia, maybe it's an elimination reaction, probably E2 mechanism. Benzene rings with leaving groups typically undergo elimination when treated with strong bases, leading to the formation of alkenes through dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, wait. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what the "-d" stands for. Oh, wait, benzene rings with deuterium? So maybe it's a deuterated compound. Like, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? Or maybe it's a typo, and it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but I don't think so. Wait, the structure is probably bromo at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. So, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

Wait, but how does the deuteration affect the reaction? Deuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen, but in this case, it's attached to the benzene ring. In reactions where H is abstracted, like elimination, the presence of D might influence the reaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a di-substituted benzene, but the 'd' is a mistake. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without being too concerned about the 'd' for now.

So, the main reaction here is dehydrohalogenation. Benzene rings with a leaving group (like Br) adjacent to another substituent (like another H or D) can lose HBr and form a double bond. So, in this case, I have 1-bromo-2-d benzene. Wait, the substituents are in positions 1 and 2 on the benzene ring.

Wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, for 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the Br is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2.

But wait, benzene is symmetric. So, the positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So, the structure is Br attached to C1 and D attached to C2. So, when NaNH2 is added, which is a strong base, it will abstract a proton (or deuterium?) beta to the Br, leading to the elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, deprotonation is tricky because the ring is aromatic. Oh, wait, but in this case, it's elimination, not substitution. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but NaNH2 is more of a base than a nucleophile. Hmm, but in aromatic substitution, nucleophilic substitution is less common unless activating groups are present. Here, Br is a leaving group, but the ring is deactivated.

Wait, maybe it's elimination. For example, in benzene rings, when a leaving group and an H are on adjacent carbons, elimination can form a double bond, resulting in a ring contraction or expansion? No, wait, benzene rings can't contract or expand. Oh, wait, perhaps the elimination is intramolecular, leading to a ring expansion or something else. Hmm, I must be mixing reactions.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already aromatic with all the double bonds. No, wait, in this case, maybe the ring isn't part of the double bond. Wait, no, the double bond would be part of the ring. Or is it an ortho elimination?

Wait, no, another possibility: the reaction could be a demetallation or something else, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: when you have a benzene ring with a bromine and a hydrogen (or deuterium) on adjacent carbons, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 can lead to the elimination of HBr, forming a double bond between the adjacent carbons. This would convert the ring into a cyclohexene derivative, but wait, no, the ring remains six-membered. So, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming a new double bond adjacent to the ring.

Wait, but benzene is already a conjugated system. Adding another double bond might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the ring isn't involved in the double bond. Wait, no, the double bond would have to be between two adjacent carbons of the benzene ring. So, maybe the ring loses a hydrogen and the bromide leaves, forming a new double bond between C1 and C2, making the ring even more conjugated. But wait, benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Adding another double bond would require a ring expansion or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The reaction of 1-bromobenzene with NaNH2 typically leads to the formation of benzene with a double bond. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the ring itself but on a substituent.

Wait, wait, maybe the starting material isn't benzene with bromine on the ring but a benzyl bromide. Oh! Wait, no, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, I think the bromine is on the benzene ring at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible products. When NaNH2 is used, perhaps it abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the bromide would leave as Br-.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have a double bond, making it a cyclohexene ring? No, that doesn't make sense because benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. If there's a double bond between C1 and C2, but the ring is still six-membered, maybe it's a matter of where the double bonds are placed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure. Benzene has six carbons with alternating double bonds. If I have Br on C1, and a hydrogen (or D) on C2, the base could abstract the hydrogen from C2, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the ring would lose H from C2 and Br from C1, forming a double bond. However, since benzene is already a conjugated system, adding another double bond would require that the ring is no longer planar? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the product is a vinyl benzene derivative. So, the benzene ring remains, but a double bond is formed in such a way that the ring becomes a styrene-like structure. For example, benzene with a double bond between C1 and C2 would not disrupt the aromaticity but would change the substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not sure that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the mechanism. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the base (NH2-) would abstract a proton (or deuterium) from the adjacent carbon (C2). The elimination would lead to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But, if that happens, the ring would lose an H and a Br, forming a new double bond. However, benzene already has a fully conjugated system, so that new double bond would be part of the ring's conjugation.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. If another double bond is formed between C1 and C2, the ring would have four double bonds, which isn't possible because that would make more than six pi electrons. So, maybe the ring undergoes some change, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that is a double bond, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation where the ring doesn't change, and the substituent is an alkyl group. Wait, no, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene, so the Br is attached to the ring. Therefore, perhaps this is a case of forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group. For example, if the Br is on a benzene ring and adjacent to another substituent, elimination would form a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is only Br and D on adjacent positions. So, perhaps when the H (or D) is abstracted, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2.

Wait, but how does that affect the ring's structure? Let me think of the ring as:

Positions 1: Br, 2: D, 3: H, 4: H, 5: H, 6: H.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 (but wait, it's a D there), would deuterium be abstracted? Or is the D just a substituent that doesn't affect the reaction?

Wait, maybe the presence of deuterium doesn't affect the reaction because the base would abstract a regular hydrogen if possible. But in this case, position 2 has D, so the base would have to abstract from another position adjacent to Br.

Wait, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent carbons are position 2 and position 6. But position 2 has a D, and position 6 has H. So, the base would abstract a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the elimination of Br- and the formation of a double bond between position 1 and position 6.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the base (NH2-) abstracts a beta hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. The elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, and the Br would leave as Br-.

But wait, if that's the case, then the product would be benzene with a double bond between C1 and C6, but since the ring is already a six-membered ring, the double bond would be part of the ring. But that would change the ring's structure.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me draw this mentally. If the Br is at position 1, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1, then the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But since the ring is six-membered, that would mean the double bond is between C1 and C6, and the existing double bonds would adjust.

Wait, but benzene has three double bonds in a conjugated system. If I form another double bond between C1 and C6, that would create four double bonds, which isn't possible. So, maybe the ring becomes a cyclohexene with a single double bond.

Wait, but benzene is aromatic, so losing a hydrogen and bromide would form a cyclohexene ring. Wait, that's possible. So, the product would be cyclohexene with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains benzene, but one of the double bonds shifts to accommodate the new double bond.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible products. If elimination occurs between C1 and C6 (adjacent to Br), then the ring would have a double bond, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new ring, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group. But wait, that would require the Br to be on a side chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the reaction is elimination, the possible products would be benzene rings with a double bond between C1 and C2, or C1 and C6. Wait, but the positions are adjacent; so elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, or C1 and C6.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6. So, elimination could lead to forming a double bond between C1 and C2, or between C1 and C6.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2 (which is a D in this case), but D is less likely to be abstracted because it's heavier. Alternatively, the base would abstract a hydrogen from another position. But in this case, position 2 has D, so the next possible hydrogen might be position 6 or position 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the positions. Let me number the benzene ring for clarity:

Imagine a benzene ring with six positions. Position 1 is where the Br is attached. Position 2 is adjacent to position 1 and has a D. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have H.

So, the possible beta hydrogens (for elimination) would be on positions 2 and 6, as they are adjacent to position 1.

But position 2 has a D, so can the base abstract that? I think deprotonation is more favorable with regular H because D has a higher isotope effect and is harder to abstract. So, the base would prefer to abstract a H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1.

So, elimination would occur between C1 (Br) and C6 (H), forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, in a benzene ring, that's possible only if the ring is restructured.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring doesn't change, and the double bond is formed in such a way that the ring remains aromatic. Wait, but that's not possible because adding another double bond would disrupt the aromaticity.

Hmm, perhaps the product isn't a benzene ring anymore but a cyclohexene ring. So, upon elimination, the six-membered ring becomes a cyclohexene with a double bond.

Wait, but benzene is a planar, aromatic ring. If elimination leads to a cyclohexene, which is a non-aromatic ring, that would imply a change in the ring's structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond. For example, if the Br is on a benzene ring and adjacent to another carbon that can lose a hydrogen, forming a vinyl group attached to the ring.

But the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, so perhaps the substituents are on the ring, not on a side chain. So, elimination would form a ring with a double bond.

Wait, but I'm not getting this. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

If elimination occurs, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene already has double bonds. So perhaps the product is a ring with multiple double bonds.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a ring contraction. For example, when the Br and adjacent H are eliminated, the ring might lose a carbon, but that doesn't make sense in this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring where the Br and D have been replaced by a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the D is still present on C2. But then, the ring would have two substituents: a double bond and a D. But that can't be right because the double bond would involve two carbons.

Wait, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the D is on C2 as well. But that would mean C2 is bonded to a D and part of a double bond. That's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons. So, if C2 is part of a double bond, it can't have a D as a substituent. Therefore, elimination would require that both the Br and the D are on adjacent carbons, and elimination would form a double bond between them, but then the D is part of the double bond, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the base abstracts the D from C2, but that's less likely because D is harder to abstract. So, the base would abstract a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), leading to formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, in that case, the ring would lose an H from C6 and Br from C1, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. So, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C6, but the other double bonds would adjust accordingly to maintain aromaticity.

Wait, but benzene has three double bonds. If another double bond is formed, that would make four, which is impossible. So, perhaps the ring isn't aromatic anymore and becomes a conjugated diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the double bond is formed outside the ring, but that doesn't make sense with the substituents.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the neighboring group participation. Wait, no, that's more for substitution reactions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring. For example, elimination could form a five-membered ring, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond. No, that's not likely because the conditions are for elimination, not for forming triple bonds.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Since NaNH2 is a strong base, but also a nucleophile in some cases. Maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that to happen, the ring needs to be activated, which typically requires electron-donating groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, so that would deactivate the ring. So, nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings is unlikely here.

So, I think elimination is the correct pathway.

So, going back, elimination leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6. Wait, but position 2 has D, so if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, the double bond would form between C1 and C6.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and the existing double bonds would have to adjust. But how? Let's imagine the ring:

Original structure:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3 (H), 4 (H), 5 (H), 6 (H).

After elimination, positions 1 and 6 form a double bond, and Br is eliminated with H from position 6. So, the new structure would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and the other double bonds would shift to accommodate.

Wait, but benzene has three double bonds. If we form a double bond between 1 and 6, then we need two more double bonds. Let's imagine the ring as positions 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 as single bonds, and 1-6 as double. No, that doesn't make sense because benzene requires all the double bonds to be conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring that's still aromatic but with a different arrangement of double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: the elimination results in the formation of a new double bond, which is part of the ring, leading to a ring that is no longer benzene but cyclohexadiene. Hmm, but that would mean the ring is non-aromatic, which is possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a substituent that's a double bond. But in that case, the substituent would be outside the ring.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about possible products. If elimination occurs, which positions can form the double bond? The base can abstract a hydrogen adjacent to the Br.

In 1-bromo-2-d benzene, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so the base would abstract from position 6.

So, elimination between C1 (Br) and C6 (H) would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But in the ring, that would mean that C1 and C6 are double-bonded. But how does that affect the ring's structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexene. So, the product would be cyclohexene with a substituent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, if elimination occurs, the ring would lose a CH2 group, but that's not the case here. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that is a vinyl group. But in this case, the substituent is at position 1, and elimination would form a double bond between position 1 and 2. But position 2 has a D, so is that possible?

Wait, no, because the D is on C2, and the base would abstract a H from another position, like position 6.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible products again. If the base abstracts a H from C6, the adjacent to C1 (Br), then the double bond forms between C1 and C6. So, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and the ring would still be six-membered.

But how does that affect the ring's aromaticity? Well, if there's a double bond between C1 and C6, the ring would have only two double bonds, which would make it non-aromatic. So, the product would be cyclohexadiene, but that's not possible because it doesn't have the right number of double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene ring, which is non-aromatic, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the ring is too stable to undergo elimination. But that can't be right because NaNH2 is a strong base.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But earlier, I thought substitution is unlikely because the ring is deactivated. However, perhaps it's a meta-directing group, and the base abstracts a hydrogen, making the ring more susceptible to attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a coupling reaction, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible products. If elimination occurs between C1 and C6, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, but that's not possible because the ring would lose aromaticity. So, perhaps the product isn't possible, but that can't be the case because the question says there are possible products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that is a vinyl group. For example, if the Br is on a side chain, but in this case, Br is directly attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, but that's not possible because the substituents are on the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new ring, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond in a position that allows the ring to remain aromatic. But I don't see how that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but that isn't the case because the ring is already a benzene.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of multiple products. Since the Br is at position 1, and the base can abstract a hydrogen from either ortho (positions 2 and 6) or para (position 4) positions. Wait, but the para position is not adjacent, so it's not a beta hydrogen.

Wait, no. In elimination, the hydrogen must be beta to the leaving group. So, in this case, the leaving group is Br on C1. The beta hydrogens are on C2 and C6.

But position 2 has a D, which may not be abstracted, so the base would abstract a hydrogen from position 6. So, elimination would occur between C1 and C6, forming a double bond between them.

But wait, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6, making the ring non-aromatic. So, the product would be a cyclohexene ring, but the question is, how many such products are possible.

Wait, but the ring is symmetric. So, the elimination from C1 and C6 would lead to a single product because the positions are symmetric.

But wait, the deuterium is on C2. So, when the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1, the D is on C2, which is meta to the elimination site.

Wait, maybe the presence of D doesn't affect the number of products because the elimination occurs at the same position regardless of D's presence.

Wait, but if the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 6 and form a double bond, that would lead to one product. Alternatively, if the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 2 (the D), but that's less likely because D is less reactive. So, perhaps only one product is formed.

Wait, but if the base can abstract from position 2, even though it's D, would that form a different product?

Wait, the base abstracts a hydrogen (or deuterium) from position 2, leading to elimination with Br from position 1, forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

So, in that case, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2. But since the ring is symmetric, would that product be the same as if the hydrogen was abstracted from C6?

No, because the positions are different. So, if the base abstracts from C2 (D), the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, while abstracting from C6 would give a double bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, in benzene, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So, forming a double bond between C1 and C2 would be the same as between C1 and C6 due to the ring's symmetry.

Wait, no. Because the ring is symmetric, abstracting a hydrogen from position 2 or position 6 would lead to the same product because the ring can rotate. So, the double bond between C1 and C2 would be the same as between C1 and C6, given the ring's symmetry.

Wait, but position 2 has D, which is a different substituent. So, maybe the presence of D affects the product's structure.

Wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is next to position 1, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, and the D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1.

But after elimination, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and the D is on C2. But, due to the ring's symmetry, that's equivalent to having the double bond between C1 and C2 with the D on C2.

Wait, no, because the ring's numbering would change. If the double bond is between C1 and C6, then the D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1. Alternatively, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, the D is on C2, which is part of the double bond, which isn't possible.

Wait, no, because the double bond would be between C1 and C2, making C2 part of a double bond, which can't have a substituent like D. So, elimination must occur between C1 and C6, which are adjacent, but without substituents on those carbons.

Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 has D, which is adjacent to C1. So, the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6 (which is also adjacent to C1) to form a double bond between C1 and C6.

In that case, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and the D remains on C2.

But in that product, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C6, and the D on C2. Since the ring has symmetry, the product would be a single structure because the double bond between C1-C6 is equivalent due to the ring's symmetry.

Wait, but the presence of the D on C2 would break the symmetry, so the product would have a specific structure with the D on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C6.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts from C2 (D), then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would require the D to be part of the double bond, which isn't possible. So, that product isn't feasible.

So, only one product is possible, where the double bond is between C1 and C6, and the D remains on C2.

Wait, but the ring's positions are symmetric. So, if the double bond is between C1 and C6, that's the same as between C1 and C2 when considering the ring's symmetry. But wait, no, because the D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1. So, the position of the D would make the two products different.

Wait, perhaps the elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to different products. For example, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either C6 or C2 (but C2 is D), leading to different double bonds.

Wait, but C2 has D, so the base can't abstract from there. So, only one possible site for elimination: C6.

So, only one product would form.

But wait, another thought: the base could abstract a hydrogen from C2, but since it's D, it's less likely, but possible. However, in that case, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would require the D to be part of the double bond, which is impossible. So, that product isn't possible.

Therefore, only one product is possible, where the double bond is between C1 and C6, with the D on C2.

Wait, but in that product, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C6, making it a non-aromatic cyclohexene. So, the product would be 1,6-dideutero benzene with a double bond between C1 and C6? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene ring with a deuterium on C2. So, it would be 1,2-dideutero cyclohexene or something like that.

But I'm not entirely sure about the structure. However, regardless of the exact structure, the elimination would lead to only one product because the only possible elimination is from C6, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a single product because the ring's symmetry makes both possible eliminations (C2 and C6) the same.

Wait, but in this case, position 2 has D, which is a different substituent. So, the product would have a deuterium on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C6, which would be a unique structure.

Wait, but the ring is symmetric, so the product would have the same structure regardless of which hydrogen is abstracted. So, the product would be the same whether the base abstracts from C2 or C6. But in this case, C2 has D, so the base abstracts from C6. So, only one product is possible.

Wait, but the D is on C2. So, the product would have the double bond between C1 and C6, and the D on C2. Since the ring is symmetric, this would be a single product.

So, the answer would be one product, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there are two possible products because the elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to different positions of the double bond.

Wait, but considering the ring's symmetry, the double bond between C1 and C2 would be the same as between C1 and C6. So, only one product.

Wait, but the D is on C2, which would break the symmetry. So, the product would have a specific configuration, making only one product.

So, the correct answer is option B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction proceeds via an elimination mechanism (E2 pathway), where a β-hydrogen is abstracted, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, where bromine is attached to position 1 of the benzene ring, and deuterium is attached to position 2. The numbering of the benzene ring is such that positions 1 and 2 are adjacent.

2. **Elimination Mechanism**:  
   - The base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a β-hydrogen (or β-deuterium) from a position adjacent to the bromine atom.  
   - The possible β-hydrogens are at positions 2 and 6, as they are adjacent to the bromine at position 1.  
   - Position 2 has a deuterium (D), which is less reactive than a regular hydrogen. Therefore, the base preferentially abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

3. **Symmetry and Product Formation**:  
   - The benzene ring is symmetric, and the elimination reaction results in a single product.  
   - The double bond formed between positions 1 and 6 is equivalent to a double bond between positions 1 and 2 due to the ring's symmetry. However, since the deuterium is specifically at position 2, the product is uniquely determined, and no additional stereoisomers or distinct products are formed.

4. **Final Product**:  
   The reaction produces a single product: benzene with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 (or equivalently, between positions 1 and 2 due to symmetry) and a deuterium at position 2.

### Conclusion:
Only one possible organic product is formed in this reaction.

Answer: B
