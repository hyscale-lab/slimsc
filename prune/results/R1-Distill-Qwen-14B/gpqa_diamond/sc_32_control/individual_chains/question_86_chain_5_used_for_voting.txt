Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about some of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that a chemist performed two reactions, each with a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again, the products for each reaction are different. Let me read it again. Oh right, Reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+ and gives the (R) product. Reaction B uses BH3 and H+ and gives the (S) product. Or wait, no, the products are both 4-ethyl... but with different configurations. Oh, right, reaction A gives (R) and reaction B gives (S).

So the question is about selecting the correct starting materials A and B from the options. The options are about the configuration of the starting acids.

Wait, let me think about what these reducing agents do. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3, on the other hand, is also a reducing agent, like in hydroboration reactions, but I think it's more selective. Oh wait, no, LiBH4 is typically used for ketones and aldehydes, producing secondary or primary alcohols. BH3 is often used with THF as a catalyst for hydroboration reactions, which typically follow anti-Markovnikov addition but can have different stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, but wait a second, the products are tetrahydro-pyran-2-one derivatives. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone or an ester? No, the starting materials are acids, according to the options. The starting materials are 5-oxopentanoic acids with substituents.

Wait, let me think. The product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen (like a cyclic ether ketone). So the reaction is probably a way to form that ring.

Oh, right! This is about the reduction of a cyclic ketone or perhaps an ester. Wait, but the starting materials are acids, so maybe it's an esterification followed by reduction?

Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me try to visualize that. Pentanoic acid (five carbons) with substituents: at carbon 3, an ethyl group; at carbon 5, an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, the structure would be: CH2(COOH) is the first carbon, then CH(CH2CH2CH3) at C3, and at C5, an OCH(CH2CH2)2 (isobutoxy) group and a ketone (so perhaps the C5 is a carbonyl? Wait, no. 5-oxo-pentanoic acid would have the structure: CH2-COOH is the first carbon, then maybe some substituents, and at C5, a carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, but the options list the starting materials as acids. So maybe the reaction is esterification, followed by reduction.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone at position 2. So, the ring would be something like O linked to two CH2 groups and a carbonyl group.

But how do you form that from a starting material like a pentanoic acid derivative?

Ah! I think this is about the reduction of a cyclic ether ketone via some kind of ring-opening or ring-forming mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of ketone reduction but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Because a lactone is a cyclic ester, which upon reduction could form a diol or something else. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid. If it's an ester, it would be a lactone when cyclic. So 5-oxopentanoic acid would have a structure like CH2-COOH-CH2-CO-O-R? No, wait, maybe it's a gamma or delta lactone.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's think about the structure. Tetrahydro pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with oxygen at one position and a ketone at position 2. The substituents are ethyl at position 4.

So the ring would be O-C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, where C2 is a carbonyl. The substituent on C4 is ethyl.

Now, the product has two enantiomers: (R) and (S) configurations. So the configuration must arise from the stereochemistry in the starting material.

So, the question is about the stereochemistry of the starting material leading to the product's configuration when reduced by either LiBH4 or BH3.

Wait, what's the difference between the two reducing agents in terms of how they affect stereochemistry?

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, when reducing ketones, the product is a secondary alcohol, but the configuration depends on the starting material. Wait, no, the reduction of a ketone (which is achiral) would lead to a racemic mixture, but if the starting ketone is chiral, perhaps the reduction could influence the configuration.

Wait, but in our case, the product isn't a secondary alcohol; it's a cyclic ketone. Wait, no, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester or a different group that, upon reduction, forms the ketone in the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a reduction of a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Because when you reduce a lactone (cyclic ester), you typically break the ring and form an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. Let me think about the reduction of an epoxide. No, that would form diols. But the product here is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with some substituents, and the reduction is adding hydrogen in a way that forms a new stereocenter.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of ketone reduction but with retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, but wait, the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else that, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ketone that upon reduction forms the ring via some mechanism.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, forms a cyclic structure through a [2+2] addition or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester RCOOR' would be reduced to RCH2OH and R'OH. But if the ester is part of a ring, like a lactone, then reducing it would open the ring.

Wait, if the starting material is a lactone, like a cyclic ester, then LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol. But our product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent ester group. Maybe a ketone that, when treated with a reducing agent, forms an alcohol that then undergoes cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a diol, which then undergoes some kind of elimination to form the ketone in the ring.

Wait, this is getting a bit convoluted. Let me perhaps think about the possible reactions of the reducing agents with the starting material.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me consider the structure of that. So, it's a six-membered ring with oxygen at position 1, ketone at position 2, and ethyl at position 4.

So, positions 1 (O), 2 (C=O), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2CH2CH3?), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH2). Wait, maybe it's a chair-like structure, but for the sake of the problem, the exact structure isn't as important as the configuration.

The problem is about the stereochemistry. So, the starting materials are (R) or (S) configured 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents. Let me try to imagine it.

The structure would be: COOH-CH2-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the substituents are at C3 and C5.

Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, pentanoic acid is CH2(CH2)3COOH. Let me index the carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2), 5 (COOH is at 1, so maybe I miscounted). Wait, wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, the structure is:

1   2      3      4       5
COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)OCH(CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, pentanoic acid is five carbons long. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

Position 1 is COOH. Position 3 is ethyl (CH2CH2CH3?), wait, no, ethyl is CH2CH3. So 3-ethyl would be a CH2CH3 group attached at carbon 3.

At position 5, it's both isobutoxy and oxo (i.e., a carbonyl). So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2CH2)2 ?

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Let me try to think of it as:

The molecule is pentanoic acid (five carbons, COOH at one end). On the third carbon (from COOH), there's an ethyl group. On the fifth carbon, there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

No, because the fifth carbon would be the last one in pentanoic acid. Wait, maybe it's:

The formula is CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but that would be six carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that seems longer.

Wait, maybe it's:

The pentanoic acid is CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but that would be five carbons in a row, with substituents on the third and fifth carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the molecule as:

1    2         3              4            5
COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2CH2CH3))- ?

Wait, that might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, but then that would be four carbons from COOH to the C(O), but the formula is pentanoic acid, so maybe the chain is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH2CH3)

Which would make the chain length correct, with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

But regardless, the key point is that the starting material is a 5-oxo pentanoic acid with substituents, and when treated with LiBH4 or BH3, it forms a specific enantiomer of the product.

So, the question is about the stereochemistry of the starting material leading to the specific configuration in the product.

Wait, so when you reduce a ketone, you get an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the reduction of an ester.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is an ester. Because pentanoic acid derivatives might form esters which, when reduced, form alcohols leading to ring formation.

Wait, but the starting material is an acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a beta-keto ester. Because beta-keto esters can be reduced to secondary alcohols, which can then form rings upon elimination or other reactions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about the reducing agents and their effects on stereochemistry.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters to alcohols. For example, an ester RCOOR' would be reduced to RCH2OH and R'OH. But if the ester is part of a cyclic structure, the ring could open and form diols or other structures.

BH3 is a milder reducing agent and is often used for the hydroboration of alkenes, which follows anti-Markovnikov addition and has specific stereochemistry based on the geometry of the alkene. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the product structure again. The product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction opens it up, leading to an alcohol which then forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism. Let's say we have a gamma-keto ester. Upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ester group is reduced to an alcohol. So, the ester group (RCOOR') becomes RCH2OR', but wait, no, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to RCH2OH and R'OH.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which when reduced by LiBH4 opens to form a diol. Then, the diol could undergo some kind of cyclization, perhaps via elimination, to form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is of a ketone group, but that would produce an alcohol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a hemiacetal or acetal. But the product is a ketone, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is a cyclic ketone with substituents. The reduction would add hydrogen in a way that forms a new stereocenter.

But the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction doesn't affect the ketone itself but another group in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then leads to the formation of the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the stereochemistry aspect. The product has (R) and (S) configurations when treated with different reducing agents. So, the configuration of the starting material must influence the outcome.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a chiral ketone, and the reduction with different agents leads to different diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so the reduction is not of a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester group, and the reduction leads to an alcohol which then becomes part of the ring structure. The configuration of the starting ester would influence the configuration of the resulting ring.

Wait, for example, if the starting ester has a specific configuration (R or S), when reduced, the resulting alcohol would have a certain configuration, which upon cyclization leads to the product's (R) or (S) configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone ring. The stereochemistry of the diol would determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, if the lactone is opened, the reduction would form two adjacent alcohols. Then, in the cyclization step, the diol would form a ring, and the configuration of the starting material would dictate the stereochemistry of the product.

But how does the reducing agent influence the configuration?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the reaction could be a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but then the alcohol undergoes a ring-forming reaction, like an acid-catalyzed cyclization to form a hemiacetal or a cyclic ether, which could form the pyranone after oxidation. But that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's about the reduction of a diketone or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

The options for A and B are all (R) or (S) versions of the same compound, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the starting materials are enantiomers or diastereomers in their configuration.

The product from Reaction A is (R), and Reaction B is (S).

So, when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it gives (R). When B is treated with BH3 and H+, it gives (S).

Wait, but what determines the configuration in the product? It must be the configuration of the starting material.

So, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a ketone group in the starting material, forming an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone ring with a specific configuration.

If the starting material is a ketone, then reducing it would form an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with another functional group that is reduced.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester adjacent to a ketone, like a beta-keto ester. When you reduce the ester group, you get an alcohol which then can undergo a cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, for example, consider a beta-keto ester: RCOCOOR'. Reducing the ester would give RCH2COOR', but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the ester leads to the formation of an alcohol, which then undergoes a cyclization with the ketone to form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic beta-keto ester, which upon reduction of the ester forms an alcohol, allowing the formation of the pyranone ring.

Wait, I'm not making much progress on the mechanism. Let me instead think about the stereochemistry.

The product is a cyclic ketone with an ethyl group at position 4. The configuration (R or S) would depend on the arrangement around the stereocenter. The stereocenter is probably the carbon where the ethyl group is attached.

So, the starting material must have a stereocenter that, upon reduction and cyclization, leads to the product's configuration.

Assuming that the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, and the reducing agent affects the way the reduction occurs.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride reducing agents. Do they have any effect on the stereochemistry during the reduction?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and is typically used in more forcing conditions. BH3, on the other hand, is often used in less polar solvents and can lead to different stereochemical outcomes, perhaps due to different reaction mechanisms.

Wait, for example, in the reduction of ketones, both LiBH4 and BH3 would produce the same product because the ketone is planar. But if the starting material is a chiral center adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps the reducing agent would influence the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone. Wait, but the starting material is an acid, so maybe it's a beta-keto acid.

Wait, if the starting material is a beta-keto acid, like CH2(COOH)-CO-R, then reduction would affect the ketone group.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the reduction leads to a diol or something else that then cyclizes.

Alternatively, thinking of the Aldol reaction. But that's more about carbonyl addition.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Upon reduction, the ester is converted to an alcohol, which then can form a ring via an elimination reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and reduction opens the ring to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, if the lactone is a cyclic ketone ester, then reduction would break the ring and form an alcohol, which could then form the new ring.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me try to think of the stereochemistry again.

The product has an R configuration when reduced with LiBH4 and S with BH3. So, perhaps the starting material's configuration is R, and depending on the reducing agent, the product's configuration is set.

Wait, but if the starting material is R, and the reduction leads to the same configuration in the product, then perhaps the correct option is when A is R and B is S, or vice versa.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says A is R and B is S. So when A is R and treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. When B is S and treated with BH3, it gives S product.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is opposite.

Wait, maybe the reduction leads to inversion. So if the starting material is R, the product is S, and vice versa.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. I think in the reduction of an ester, the stereochemistry might not be directly inverted but depends on the mechanism.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, the reduction would form a secondary alcohol, which would then cyclize. The configuration of the starting material would determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, for example, if the starting material's configuration is R, the secondary alcohol formed would have a certain configuration, leading to the R product.

Wait, but I'm not making much headway. Let me think about the options again.

Option C says A is S and B is R. So when A (S) is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. When B (R) is treated with BH3, it gives S product.

Hmm, that would require the reaction to invert the configuration. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is opposite to the product's configuration.

Wait, why would the product's configuration be opposite? If the reduction leads to the formation of the opposite configuration.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the facial attack during the reduction. For instance, in some reductions, the hydride attacks from a specific face, determining the configuration.

Wait, when using LiBH4, the hydride attack is from the less hindered side, leading to a certain configuration. Whereas BH3 might approach from a different face, leading to the opposite configuration.

But I'm not sure about that. I think that for ketone reductions, the product would be a racemic mixture unless the starting material is chiral and the reduction is stereoselective.

Wait, but wait, our starting material is a chiral acid. When it's reduced, perhaps the configuration is retained or inverted based on the reducing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a cyclic transition state, where the configuration is determined by the approach of the hydride.

Wait, maybe the reduction of the ester (if the starting material is an ester) would form an alcohol with a specific configuration depending on the reducing agent.

If the starting material's ester is in a certain configuration, the hydride would attack from a specific face, leading to the product's configuration.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material is R, and the hydride attacks from the same face, the product would be R. If it attacks from the opposite face, the product would be S.

But which reducing agent causes which attack?

I recall that BH3, especially in hydroboration reactions, follows anti-Markovnikov and leads to syn addition. But that's for alkenes, not esters.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an ester to an alcohol, and the stereochemistry is controlled by the reducing agent.

Wait, in the reduction of esters, the mechanism typically involves the formation of an alkoxide intermediate. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a negative charge, which is then protonated.

In such a case, the hydride attack can proceed from either face, leading to a racemic mixture unless there's some steric hindrance or other factors influencing the approach.

But in our case, the starting material is chiral, so perhaps the approach of the hydride is influenced by the existing stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe the configuration of the starting material creates a certain environment where the hydride attacks from a specific face, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

So, if the starting material is R, the hydride attacks from the Re face, leading to an R configuration in the product (if the configuration is retained) or S (if inverted).

But I'm not exactly sure how the configuration is determined.

Wait, I think I need to approach this differently. Let's say that the starting material's configuration is S. When reduced with LiBH4, it forms an alcohol with R configuration, which upon cyclization forms the R product. When the same starting material is treated with BH3, perhaps the hydride attacks from the opposite face, leading to an S configuration in the product.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is the same as the product.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which would have a different arrangement of substituents.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may cause different stereochemical outcomes compared to BH3.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. I think I need to think about how the reaction would proceed.

The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's imagine it's an ester, but the options list it as an acid. Wait, but perhaps the acid is converted to an ester in the reaction conditions.

Wait, maybe LiBH4 in acidic conditions would protonate the carbonyl and make it a better electrophile for reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto acid, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization.

Wait, if the starting material is a beta-keto acid, the structure would be R-CO-CO-OH. Upon reduction, the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol, forming R-CH(OH)-CH2-OH. Then, perhaps, under certain conditions, this diol would undergo cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how? Because the diol would have two hydroxyl groups, which could form a cyclic acetal or hemiacetal, but that would involve elimination of water and formation of a ring with an oxygen.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps after the diol forms, oxidation occurs to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes an acid-catalyzed cyclization where one hydroxyl attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a five-membered ring, but that would give a cyclic ether, not a ketone.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck on the exact mechanism, but perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options.

The question is about the stereochemistry of the starting materials leading to R and S products when reduced with different agents.

Assuming that the configuration of the starting material dictates the product's configuration, and that the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) influence the approach of the hydride, leading to different configurations.

So, for Reaction A, when A is treated with LiBH4, which is a stronger reducing agent, perhaps it leads to a specific configuration.

Reaction B, when B is treated with BH3, which is a milder agent, perhaps leads to the opposite configuration.

In that case, the starting material's configuration would be opposite to the product's configuration.

So, if A leads to (R), then A's configuration would be (S). And B, which leads to (S), would have (R) configuration.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is A is S and B is R.

Option D is A is R and B is S.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, where A is R and B is S.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is retained. So if the starting material is R, the product is R.

In that case, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, product is R. B is S and treated with BH3, product is S.

Looking at the options, option D is A is R, B is S.

That would align with the products given.

So, the correct answer would be D: A is R, B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct starting materials for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, when treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives, which can exist as (R) or (S) configurations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - Reaction A uses LiBH4, a strong reducing agent, to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.  
   - Reaction B uses BH3, a milder reducing agent, to produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.  
   - The stereochemistry of the starting material directly influences the configuration of the product.

2. **Mechanism Considerations**:  
   - The starting material is a chiral compound, and the stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product.  
   - The reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) may influence the approach of the hydride during the reduction, leading to different configurations in the product.

3. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured starting materials. This would not produce the observed enantiomeric products, as identical starting materials would not lead to different configurations in the products.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured starting materials. Similar to Option A, this would not produce the observed enantiomeric products.  
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would imply that the stereochemistry of the starting material is opposite to the product, which is inconsistent with the expected relationship between the starting material and the product.  
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This aligns with the observed products: (R)-configured A produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and (S)-configured B produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This option maintains the relationship between the starting material and the product.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for Reaction A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for Reaction B. This matches the stereochemical outcome of the reactions.

**Answer: D**
