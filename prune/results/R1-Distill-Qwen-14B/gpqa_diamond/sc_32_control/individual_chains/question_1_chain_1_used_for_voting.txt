Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, okay, let me read it carefully. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but maybe I'm mixing up the exact factors. Oh well, I think the key is the relation between energy and lifetime for distinguishing levels.

So, the formula I recall is ΔE ≈ ħ / (Δt), where Δt is the lifetime of the state. Because if a state has a longer lifetime, the uncertainty in its energy is smaller, meaning it's more precisely known. So for each state, I can calculate the uncertainty in energy.

Let me write that down. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But wait, the options are given in eV, so I'll need to convert units properly.

For E1 with lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 would be ħ / τ1. Similarly for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Wait a second, but actually, the energy uncertainty is related to the inverse of the lifetime. If the lifetime is shorter, the energy uncertainty is larger because the state doesn't last long enough for precise measurement. So, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the product? No, because each state's energy uncertainty is around ħ/τ.

Wait, maybe the minimum energy difference needed to resolve the two states is the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is less than that sum, the lines would overlap and you can't distinguish them. So ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Hmm, I'm not so sure. I think it's the sum because each state's uncertainty contributes to the overall ability to distinguish them. Let me think: If two states have energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, the minimum separation between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of these uncertainties to prevent overlap in their probability distributions. So E2 - E1 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 is what's important. So if ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2), then the two states can be resolved. Alternatively, maybe it's ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) or something else.

Let me compute each ΔE.

First, compute for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert that to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.60217663e-19 J, so:

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.60217663e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.05457e-25) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, 1e-25 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-6, so 1.05e-25 J is about 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05457e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the sum of these uncertainties is about 6.58e-7 +6.58e-8 = approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, 7.238e-7 is 7.238 ×1e-7. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than this sum for the two states to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is 0.001e-6 eV, which is way smaller than 7.238e-7. So no.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → that's 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7.238e-7, so definitely larger. So this would work.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.14 times 7.238e-7 (since 7.238e-7 is ~7.2e-7, 1e-8 is 0.0014 * 7.2e-7). So 1e-8 is smaller than 7.2e-7, so this wouldn't be enough.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait, wait. I think I may have gotten the energy difference condition wrong. Let me think again.

The energy uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1, meaning E1 can vary by ±ΔE1. Similarly for E2, E2 can vary by ±ΔE2. So, to be distinguishable, the separation between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties: E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Because if the difference is less than the sum, the intervals could overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So, the energy difference ΔE (E2-E1) must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Calculating the sum:

ΔE1 ≈6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2≈6.58e-8 eV.

Sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = (6.58 + 0.658) e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 = 1e4 * 0.14 * 7.238e-7. Wait, no, perhaps I should compute 1e-4 eV compared to 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, and 7.238e-7 eV is 0.0000007238 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than 7.238e-7. So option C is way larger and would satisfy the condition.

Looking at the other options, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 1.4e-1 × 7.238e-7 eV. That is, 1e-8 is smaller than 7.238e-7, so not sufficient.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C, 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). The energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties to ensure they can be resolved:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{required}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \)
For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60217663 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Sum of uncertainties
The total uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with options
To resolve the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E > 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Final Answer
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
