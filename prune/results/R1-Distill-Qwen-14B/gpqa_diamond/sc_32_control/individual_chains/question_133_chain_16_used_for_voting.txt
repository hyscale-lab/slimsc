Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3- I think. Or is HPO4^2- considered orthophosphate? Hmm, I might need to clarify that. Oh wait, I remember that orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. But sometimes HPO4^2- is also referred to as orthophosphate; maybe it depends on the context. Well, I'll proceed and see where it goes.

The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, and these are the ionization constants for each deprotonation step.

Alright, let's break this down. The solution contains two different phosphate salts: KH2PO4 (which is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, K+ H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na+ HPO4^2-), with some water of crystallization but I think that doesn't affect the molarity much.

I think that when these two salts dissolve in water, they contribute to the solution different forms of phosphate. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4 would normally dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, but since it's the dihydrate, maybe the actual form is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O, which upon dissolving would release HPO4^2- and Na+ ions, along with the water molecules.

So the two salts are providing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions in solution. Now, given that both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid-base pairs, they can undergo hydrolysis. The H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the presence of both these ions might lead to some sort of buffer solution. Since H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-, their concentrations would determine the pH of the solution. But the problem is asking specifically for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but sometimes HPO4^2- is considered orthophosphate. So maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but when HPO4^2- is present, is that considered an orthophosphate salt? Or perhaps in this context, the question refers to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should proceed and see what calculations I can do, and perhaps that will clear it up.

So, perhaps the first step is to calculate the molarity of each salt in the solution. Let's start with that.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So for KH2PO4, the moles are mass / molecular weight. The mass is 1.00 g, and the Mw is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007336 mol. So about 0.007336 moles.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005608 moles.

Wait, but wait: does the 2H2O in the formula matter for the molarity? I think not because the formula accounts for the entire molecule, so when dissolved, the number of moles is just based on the formula mass. So yes, I should proceed with these mole calculations.

Now, the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

So the molarity of KH2PO4 is 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

Similarly, the molarity of Na2HPO4 is 0.005608 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02804 M.

But wait, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- ions, right? Because it's K+ and H2PO4^-.

Similarly, each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2- ions, because the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O, so each mole releases one HPO4^2-.

So the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03668 M and HPO4^2- is 0.02804 M.

Now, considering the dissociation of H3PO4:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Wait, but in solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can undergo further deprotonation. But in this case, I think the solution will be a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because both are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the HPO4^2- can act as a base, accepting a proton from H2PO4^- to form more HPO4^2-? Or wait, since H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-, in solution, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, but that would depend on the pH.

Wait, but the pH of the solution is determined by the ratio of these two. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Let me think: Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, the pKa here would be the second dissociation constant, pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = around 7.207 (since 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 1e-8, so log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 8 - 0.79 = 7.21).

So, pH = 7.21 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M.

So the ratio is 0.02804 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.115.

So pH = 7.21 - 0.115 ≈ 7.095.

Wait, but wait! I thought that Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.207, yes. So that makes sense.

But wait, the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that we can calculate the pH of the solution using this buffer equation. But I'm not sure if that's necessary for finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions.

Wait, the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-. So to find [PO4^3-], we need to find how much HPO4^2- has dissociated into PO4^3-.

But in the solution, the HPO4^2- is present, and it can further deprotonate to form PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can solve for [PO4^3-], but we need to know the [H+] concentration, which we can get from the pH we calculated earlier (approx 7.095).

So, pH is about 7.095, which means [H+] = 10^-pH = approx 8.29e-8 M.

Now, plugging into the Ka3 expression:

1.8e-12 = (8.29e-8) * [PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / (8.29e-8).

Let me compute the denominator first. 8.29e-8 is 8.29 x 1e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.29e-8.

Let me calculate the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 ≈ 5.0472e-14.

Then, divide by 8.29e-8: 5.0472e-14 / 8.29e-8 ≈ let's compute this.

5.0472e-14 / 8.29e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.29) * 1e-6.

5.0472 / 8.29 ≈ approximately 0.608. So 0.608e-6 = 6.08e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me do the exact calculation:

5.0472e-14 divided by 8.29e-8 is (5.0472 / 8.29) * 1e-6.

5.0472 / 8.29 = approximately 0.608 as I thought before.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.08e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. Hmm, maybe I made some approximations.

Wait, let me check each step for possible errors.

First, calculating the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that accurately.

136.09 is about 136.1, so 1 / 136.1 = 0.007336 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol. 177.99 is about 178. So 1/178 ≈ 0.0056179 mol. I think my earlier calculation was 0.005608, which is about 0.005608 mol. So that's correct.

Molarity: for KH2PO4, 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M. Correct.

Na2HPO4: 0.005608 / 0.2 = 0.02804 M. Correct.

Next, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.207.

Taking the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02804 / 0.03668.

0.02804 / 0.03668 = (28.04/36.68) *0.01/0.01.

Calculate 28.04 /36.68 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is negative. Let's compute it more accurately.

Log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) = log(7.64) + log(1e-1) = 0.8838 -1 = -0.1162.

So pH = 7.207 -0.1162=7.0908.

[H+] = 10^-7.0908 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Now, using Ka3 =1.8e-12.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So,

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] =0.02804 M,

[H+] =8.23e-8.

So,

(1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.23e-8) = ?

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 = 5.0472e-14.

Denominator:8.23e-8.

So 5.0472e-14 /8.23e-8 = 5.0472 /8.23 * 1e-6.

5.0472 /8.23 ≈ 0.6133.

So 0.6133e-6 =6.133e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.13e-7 M. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is close but a bit higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps my calculation of [H+] was a bit approximate. Let me compute [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.0908, so [H+] = 10^(-7.0908).

We can compute that as e^(ln(10)*(-7.0908)).

Alternatively, 7.0908 is approximately 7.09. Let's compute 10^(-7.09).

Log(10^7.09) =7.09 → 10^7.09≈1.22e7 → but wait, 7.09 is 7 +0.09.

10^0.09 ≈1.229 (since 10^0.1≈1.258, 0.09 is a bit less, say 1.229).

So 10^7.09=1.229e7 → 10^-7.09=1/(1.229e7)=8.14e-8.

Wait, so [H+] is approximately 8.14e-8 M.

Let me recalculate [PO4^3-].

So,

(1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.14e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02804=5.0472e-14.

Denominator:8.14e-8.

So,

5.0472e-14 /8.14e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.14) *1e-6.

5.0472 /8.14 ≈ approx 0.6196.

So 0.6196e-6 =6.196e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.20e-7, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

Wait, but perhaps there were more precise calculations in the steps that led to a slight difference. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, let me check the exact value of [H+] again.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log (base/acid)

pKa2 is 7.207.

base is [HPO4^2-] =0.02804 M.

acid is [H2PO4^-] =0.03668 M.

ratio =0.02804/0.03668 =0.7643.

Log(0.7643) = log(7.643e-1) = log(7.643) -1.

Log(7.643) is approximately 0.8838, so 0.8838 -1 =-0.1162.

So pH=7.207 -0.1162=7.0908.

[H+]=10^-7.0908 ≈8.14e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02804)/8.14e-8 = ?

Let me compute this with more precision.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02804 = let's compute 1.8 *0.02804 = 0.050472. So 0.050472e-12 =5.0472e-14.

Denominator:8.14e-8.

So 5.0472e-14 /8.14e-8 = (5.0472 /8.14) *1e-6.

Compute 5.0472 /8.14.

Let me compute 8.14 *0.62 =5.04 (because 8.14 *0.6=4.884, 8.14 *0.02=0.1628 → total 4.884+0.1628=5.0468. So 0.62 *8.14=5.0468. So 5.0472/8.14=0.62 approximately.

So 0.62 *1e-6 =6.2e-7 M.

So that brings us to 6.2e-7, which is 6.2e-7, which would match option A (6.24e-7) closely. But why the slight discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in calculations.

Let me compute 5.0472 /8.14 with more precision.

5.0472 ÷8.14.

8.14 *0.62 =5.0468, as above. So 5.0472-5.0468=0.0004.

So 0.0004 /8.14 =0.0004/(8.14) ≈0.00004914.

So total is 0.62 +0.00004914=0.620049.

So 0.620049 *1e-6=6.20049e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.20e-7 M. So option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the molar mass is (Na:22.99*2) + HPO4: (H is 1, P is 30.97, O is 16*4) → 1 +30.97 +64=95.97.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, HPO4^3- has a molar mass of (H:1) + (P:30.97) + (O:16*4)=95.97 g/mol. But the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O.

So the molar mass is (Na: 22.99 *2) + (HPO4: 95.97) + (2 H2O: 2*(2*1 +16))=22.99*2=45.98, HPO4=95.97, H2O: 2*(18) =36.

So 45.98 +95.97=141.95 +36=177.95 g/mol. Which aligns with the given Mw of 177.99 g/mol. So my calculation of moles as 1.00g /177.99 g/mol ≈0.005608 mol is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

[HPO4^2-] =0.02804 M.

[H2PO4^-]=0.03668 M.

0.02804 /0.03668 = (28.04 /36.68) = 0.7643.

Wait, let me compute that as (2804/3668)=0.7643.

So log(0.7643) = ?

Using a calculator, log(0.7643) is approximately -0.1158.

So pH =7.207 -0.1158=7.0912.

So [H+]=10^-7.0912.

Compute 10^7.0912 = 10^7 *10^0.0912.

10^0.0912= approximately 1.237 (since 10^0.1=1.258, so 0.0912 is a bit less. Let me calculate more accurately).

Using natural logs:

ln(10^0.0912)=0.0912 * ln(10)=0.0912*2.302585≈0.210.

e^0.210≈1.234.

So 10^0.0912≈1.234.

So 10^7.0912=1.234e7 → so [H+]=1/(1.234e7)=8.10e-8 M.

So [H+]=8.10e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02804) /8.10e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02804=5.0472e-14.

Denominator:8.10e-8.

So 5.0472e-14 /8.10e-8= (5.0472/8.10) *1e-6.

5.0472 ÷8.10 = let's calculate that.

8.10 x 0.62 =5.022.

5.0472-5.022=0.0252.

0.0252/8.10=approx 0.00311.

So total is 0.62 +0.00311=0.62311.

So 0.62311e-6=6.2311e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.23e-7 M. That's very close to option A (6.24e-7), which would be 6.24e-7 M.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the orthophosphate ion in solution PO4^3- or HPO4^2-?

Wait, I think I might have confused the terms. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the conjugate bases are the different forms. Orthophosphate is the most deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-.

But in the solution, the HPO4^2- is present. So when it dissociates, it forms PO4^3-. So the concentration of PO4^3- is what I calculated as approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- contributes to the phosphate species, but we are to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and that the PO4^3- is a minor species, thus the concentration is determined by the third dissociation.

Hmm, all my steps so far seem correct. So perhaps the answer is indeed option A.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the problem may actually be asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is 0.02804 M, but that's not one of the options.

No, the options are all around 1e-7 M, so it's about PO4^3-.

So, the calculations led me to approximately 6.23e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M).


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the subsequent equilibria involving phosphate species. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided as Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles and molarity of each salt
1. **KH₂PO₄**:  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Molarity = \( \frac{0.007336 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M} \).  
   This contributes 0.03668 M H₂PO₄⁻ ions.

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005608 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Molarity = \( \frac{0.005608 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02804 \, \text{M} \).  
   This contributes 0.02804 M HPO₄²⁻ ions.

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant dissociation constant is Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, so:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]  
The ratio of base to acid is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} = \frac{0.02804}{0.03668} \approx 0.764
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right) = 7.207 + \log(0.764)
\]  
\[
\log(0.764) \approx -0.115 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{pH} \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]  
The hydrogen ion concentration is:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.14 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄}^{3-}
\]  
The equilibrium constant is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄}^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄}^{3-}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02804)}{8.14 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02804) \approx 5.0472 \times 10^{-14}
\]  
Then, divide by the denominator:  
\[
\frac{5.0472 \times 10^{-14}}{8.14 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.196 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]  
This is approximately \( 6.20 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

### Final Answer
The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is closest to **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A**
