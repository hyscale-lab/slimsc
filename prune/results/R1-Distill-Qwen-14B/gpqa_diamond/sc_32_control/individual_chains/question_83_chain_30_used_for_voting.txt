Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Alright, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh, and we're given the Ka of acetic acid as 1.85x10^-5.

Wait, let me think step by step. First, maybe I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration 0.05 M. When we add another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So, the diluted concentration would be (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Plugging the numbers: (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, wait, that makes sense because diluting equal volumes would halve the concentration. So the initial concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, 25% titration means we've added a quarter of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So I should find out the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. The mole ratio is 1:1.

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.025 M, as I found before.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, let's tackle the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence.

Starting with 25% titration.

At 2.5 cm³, which is a quarter of the equivalence point volume, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, this will neutralize 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^-.

So the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution now is initial volume (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ NaOH = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

First, calculate pKa. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.735 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733)

Wait, let me do that more accurately. 1.85 ×10^-5: log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa = 5 - 0.267 = 4.733.

So, pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, so around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value. But wait, let me check if I made any miscalculations.

Wait, let me re-do the ratio: 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3, which is 0.3333. So the log is -0.477. So yes, 4.733 minus 0.477 is about 4.256.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26. So option A or D have this value. Let me see.

Wait, the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

D) 4.57; 6.92

So the first part would fit A and D? Wait no, D's first pH is 4.57, which is higher than 4.26.

So the first part is 4.26. So the possible options are A and D. Wait, looking at the options, let me check.

Wait, no. Option A's first pH is 4.26, and D's is 4.57. So for 25% titration, the correct pH is approximately 4.26. So the first part would match option A.

Wait, but let me think again about my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the dilution?

Wait, the initial solution after dilution: 0.05 M * 20 cm³ + 20 cm³ water. So 20 + 20 =40 cm³. So 0.05 *20 = 1 mmol, but 40 cm³, so 1/40 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, the volume added is 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.25 mmol (since 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol). Correct.

So the moles after reaction: HA is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol, A^- is 0.00025 mol.

Concentration of HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈4.256, which is ~4.26. So the first pH is 4.26. So the options A and D have 4.26 as first pH? No, A's first is 4.26, D's is 4.57.

Wait, what's the second part? The equivalence point pH. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

So, first, find the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. The total solution volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of sodium acetate: 0.001 mol (as all the acetic acid is neutralized).

Concentration: 0.001 mol /0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484.

So pH =14 -5.484 =8.516, approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid would be above 7, which it is here (8.52). So the equivalence pH is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → Looks like this matches.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → No, the equivalence pH is much higher.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the Kb calculation? Let me double-check:

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then, the concentration is 0.02 M. So x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11. Square root is ~3.288e-6. That's correct.

So pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me calculate that more accurately.

log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → log(3.288)=0.5167 → 0.5167 -6 = -5.4833 → pOH=5.4833 → pH=8.5167 → approx 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is 8.52. So the first value is 4.26, second is 8.52. That matches option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that's our answer.

Wait, but another thought. Wait, I'm assuming that the equivalence point solution is only from the acetate. But wait, the solution volume is 50 cm³. Let me recheck the moles.

Wait, original acetic acid was 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.010 L = 0.001 mol. So yes, all the acetic acid is neutralized, producing 0.001 mol of acetate, which is in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So 0.02 M. So correct.

So why am I getting a pH of 8.52 at equivalence? But wait, some of the options don't have that. Let me check if any of the options match. Option A has 4.26; 8.52. So that's the correct pair.

Wait, but looking at the given options, option D is 4.57;6.92. So perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration part.

Wait, let me re-examine the 25% titration. Because sometimes, when you dilute, the buffer calculation might change.

Wait, another approach: the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

At 25% titration, which is 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001. Moles reacted: 0.00025. Remaining: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

So, the concentrations in the solution of 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L):

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log(A-/HA) → 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Wait, 0.005882 / 0.017647 equals 1/3, about 0.3333. Log(1/3)= -0.477.

So pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is about 4.26. So correct.

So the first pH is 4.26, the second is 8.52. So option A's first and second values match. But wait, the options are:

Option A: 4.26;8.52

Option D:4.57;6.92

Hmm, but I'm not seeing another option that has 4.26 and 8.52. So, the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. That doesn't match my calculations. So why is option D present?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Could the 25% titration refer to the volume of the acid solution? No, the question says 25% titration, which I think refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ correct.

Another possibility: maybe I should consider the dilution differently. Wait, when you add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, the concentration becomes half, so 0.025 M correct.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? Let me recheck:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) → 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Wait, 0.005882 divided by 0.017647 is approximately 0.3333. Log(0.333)= -0.477. So yes, 4.733 -0.477=4.256. Correct.

So why isn't the option A matching? Oh, looking at the options, option A is "4.26;8.52". So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I just noticed that the equivalence point pH I calculated is 8.52, which is higher than 7, which makes sense because it's a basic solution.

So the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we first determine the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ at 0.05 M, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required for equivalence are also 0.001 mol. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Molarity of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH) is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of sodium acetate in a total volume of 50.00 cm³ (40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³). The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( x \) be the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) produced. Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484,
\]
and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option A: 4.26; 8.52.**

Answer: A
