Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about some chemical reactions, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So first, I need to figure out what E is. Let's break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Okay, 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. So maybe A is something like sulfur or another solid, and B is a gas like oxygen or something else.

Wait, bright red product. I remember that when some metals react with oxygen, they form colored compounds. For example, copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe iron(III) oxide is reddish. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with oxygen to form SO3? Or maybe it's a reaction where solid A is something else.

Wait, another thought: If A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2), then 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na. Because sodium has a +1 charge and chlorine is -1. So Na + 4 Cl2 → NaCl. Wait, but that's 1:4. Hmm, perhaps that's not matching the 8 equivalents.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The reaction is 8 equivalents of B. So if the formula is A + 8 B → product C. So the stoichiometry is 1 A to 8 B. So maybe A is something with a charge that when combined gives 8 B per A.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal. Let's think of metals reacting with oxygen or another diatomic gas.

Wait, another approach: The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm. So C is the product of the first reaction. Then C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio to give E.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to form A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a solid (A) and two acids.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent, maybe something like water, alcohol, or something else.

Let me try to piece this together.

Let me think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one.

Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include H3PO4, H2CO3, H2S.

Wait, but since F and G are two different acids, maybe the hydrolysis of C produces two acids. Hmm.

Let's think about some possible C. C is bright red. Maybe it's a metal oxide. For example, maybe it's Fe2O3, which is reddish. Or perhaps something else.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide, then when it reacts with water, it could form a metal hydroxide. But in the third reaction, it's forming A and two acids. So perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives a metal hydroxide (which decomposes? Or perhaps it's a different scenario).

Wait, another angle: suppose C is a sulfite or sulfate. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, considering the product E, which is extremely hazardous. What are some very hazardous chemicals? Maybe something like sarin, or other nerve agents? Or perhaps something else. Wait, but that's maybe too vague.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene (but that's a gas), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. Let me think: if C is a nitrate salt, then reacting it with something else could produce E.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about D. D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. So D + B → H (solvent). Let's think about possible solvents: H2O, ethanol, methanol, etc. If H is H2O, then D + B → H2O. So what would D and B be?

Wait, D and B in a 1:1 ratio. So, for example, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, if it's another reaction, like CO2 + H2O → H2CO3, but that's a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but H is a solvent. Maybe H is something like ethanol. If B is O2, then D could be something else. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something that reacts with Cl to make a solvent. Hmm.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to try to figure out each part step by step.

Let me start with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). What's a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in 1:8 ratio to form a bright red product?

Ah! Wait a moment. I think I remember that when vanadium reacts with oxygen, it can form different oxides. Vanadium(IV) oxide is a bright orange-red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different element.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with oxygen to form SO3, but SO3 is a liquid that is colorless or pale yellow, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's lead(IV) oxide, which is dark brown or red. Or maybe it's another oxide.

Wait, another thought: what if A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2)? The reaction would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's 1:2 ratio, not 8. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: 8 equivalents. So in the first reaction, the formula is A + 8 B → C. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are consumed.

So perhaps A is something with a +8 charge? Or maybe more accurately, the oxidation state of A would be such that each atom of A reacts with 8 B atoms.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is oxygen (O2). So for each mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are consumed. So A would be a metal that forms a +16 oxidation state. That's a bit high, but some metals can form high oxidation states, like rhenium or molybdenum.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S), and B is oxygen. The reaction could be S + 8 O2 → something. Wait, the common oxidation states of sulfur are +4 and +6. S + O2 forms SO2 and SO3. But for 8 equivalents of O2, maybe it's forming a sulfide or something else.

Wait, perhaps A is phosphorus. Let's think: P (solid) reacting with O2 gas. Phosphorus in its +5 oxidation state forms P2O5, which is white. But maybe another compound? Wait, maybe A is a transition metal.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the fact that C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So C is likely a salt, perhaps a metal oxide or a nitrate.

If C is a nitrate, for example, then when it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes to form the metal hydroxide and nitric acid. But F and G are two different acids. So perhaps one is nitric acid (a strong acid) and another is something else.

Wait, but F is strong and G is weak. So maybe the hydrolysis of C produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a carbonate, then hydrolysis would produce carbonic acid (weak) and maybe another acid if it's a salt of a weak acid and a strong base.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a sulfite, like MgSO3, then when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to form Mg(OH)2 and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But then what is A in that case? Oh, wait, A would be Mg(OH)2, but that's a solid, but I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate, like CaSO4, then hydrolysis would produce Ca(OH)2 and H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, and if another acid is formed, perhaps CaSO4 doesn't fit because it wouldn't produce two different acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it forms NH3 (a weak base, but not an acid) and Ca(OH)2. That doesn't fit because we need two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is something else. Let me think about the acids. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So perhaps when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), then upon hydrolysis, it could produce HNO3 (strong) and NH4OH (which is weak, but it's a base, not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps C is a nitrate and D is something that can reduce it, like carbon or another reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Fe2O3 (reddish), then reacting with D (maybe something like CO) could produce Fe3O4 or another compound. But I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene (but I'm not certain). Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent like sarin, but that's more of a stretch.

Wait, another angle: The fact that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, what solvents are formed from reactions of gases?

If B is CO2 and D is H2O, then they react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's not a typical solvent. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, then they form H2O, which is a solvent. But the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Wait, another possibility. Suppose B is O2 and D is H2O. Then maybe H is something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something that reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. For example, if D is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), then Cl2 + ethanol might form something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the solvent is something like ethanol. So D plus B → ethanol. If B is O2, then maybe D is something that when reacts with O2 gives ethanol. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is H2O. So D and B react to form H2O. So D + B → H2O. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's a 2:1 ratio, but the question says 1:1. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is NaOH. Cl2 + 2 NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H2O. But that's a 1:2 ratio.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is something else. Not sure.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to think about what E is, given that it's extremely hazardous. Let me think about some extremely hazardous chemicals.

One possibility is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Another is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but that's more of a gas. Or perhaps sarin gas, but that's a organophosphorus compound. Alternatively, something like chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), which is highly dangerous.

Wait, if E is ClF3, then what would C and D be? Let me think: C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E. Suppose C is ClF (hypochlorous fluoride?), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of some acid-base reaction or redox reaction.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the formula of E. If C + 2 D → E, perhaps E has a formula involving C and D's elements. If C is a nitrate, perhaps D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is about something like sulfur trioxide (but that's a gas). No, the first reaction's product C is a solid, I think, since it's formed from a solid and gas.

Wait, another thought. Maybe A is carbon (solid), B is O2. Then, C could be CO2 or CO. But CO2 is a gas, not solid. Unless it's formed under high pressure. Not sure.

Alternatively, A is iron (Fe), B is O2. Then, C could be Fe3O4, which is black, not red. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a metal like copper, and B is sulfur (in solid form?), but the question says B is a gas. Sulfur is a solid at room temperature.

Wait, perhaps B is a diatomic gas, like O2, N2, Cl2, etc.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a +3 ion. For example, aluminum (Al^3+). If B is O2, then Al + 3 O2 → Al2O3. But that's 2 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So the stoichiometry is 2:3, not 1:8. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps A is sodium (Na), and B is O2. Then, 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But that's 2:1, not 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A is sodium and B is Cl2, then 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So for each Na, 1 Cl2 is used. So 1:1 ratio, not 8:1.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the product C's reaction with water. It produces A, F, and G, two different acids. So C is probably a salt of F and G's conjugate bases.

Wait, for example, if F is HCl (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), then C might be a carbonate salt, like NaHCO3 or something. But then hydrolysis would produce HCl and H2CO3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If C is sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), then hydrolysis might produce NaOH (a strong base, not acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). But that's only one acid, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Ca3N2, then hydrolysis gives NH3 (a weak base) and Ca(OH)2. But again, that gives a base, not an acid.

Hmm. Another angle: Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is an acid salt. For example, sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4). When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^-; the HSO4^- can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but that gives H+ (from a strong acid, H2SO4) and maybe another acid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfamide. Not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's look at the options for E's molecular symmetry group.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

These are symmetry groups from point group theory. D4h and D∞h are higher symmetry groups. C2 and C2v are lower symmetry.

E is extremely hazardous, perhaps a molecule with a certain structure. For example, phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) has a certain symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like CO2, which is linear (D∞h symmetry).

Wait, CO2 is linear, so its symmetry group is D∞h. If E is CO2, then what would the reactions be?

Let me see: Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). If C is CO2, that doesn't make sense because CO2 is a gas, not a solid. So probably not.

Wait, another possibility: E is H2O2, but that's a weak acid and not extremely hazardous in small quantities, but it's a strong oxidizer. But I'm not sure about the symmetry of H2O2. Its structure is bent, with a C2v symmetry group.

Wait, if E is H2O2, then the symmetry group would be C2v (option D). But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Another option: If E is something like CH3Cl (methyl chloride), but that's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, something like sarin, which is a chiral molecule, but I'm not certain about its symmetry.

Wait, let me think about E's structure. If E is a molecule with a certain point group, that would determine the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule, which would have D∞h symmetry. So option C.

Which molecules have D∞h symmetry? CO2, HCN, etc. So if E is a linear molecule, then symmetry group C is D∞h.

So let's think: What reactions would lead to a linear molecule E?

Alternatively, if E is something like HCl (but HCl is a gas, not extremely hazardous?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the reactions again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid).

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous).

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

So let's consider reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1.

If H is H2O, then D + B → H2O. Let's think of B as O2 and D as H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: B is NH3 and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is SO2 and D is something. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps reaction 4 is D + B → H2O. So D could be H2O2 and B could be something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else, but I'm stuck.

Let me try to think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A (solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

So C is likely a salt. Let's see: when a salt reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into corresponding acids and bases.

If C is a nitrate salt, like NaNO3, hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and the conjugate base of the anion. But if the anion is from a weak acid, then the product would be a weak acid. For example, if C is Na2CO3, then hydrolysis would produce 2 NaOH (strong base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). But in the reaction, F and G are acids. So perhaps the salt C is a nitrate and another anion.

Wait, for example, if C is NH4NO3, then hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH (which is a weak base, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Another example: If C is NaHSO4, hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that's not two acids.

Hmm. Maybe C is a sulfonate salt. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). No, because F and G are acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. For example, Al(OH)3. Reacting with water doesn't make sense though. Maybe the hydrolysis is under acidic or basic conditions.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is CaO. CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2. But that produces a base, not acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. Reacting with water might not do much unless it's heated or there's an acid present. But in the reaction, it's just water.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. H2S is a weak acid. But Fe(OH)2 is a base, so that would produce a base and an acid. Wait, but in the reaction, it's A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So perhaps A is the metal hydroxide, F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Hmm, but in this case, Fe(OH)2 is a base, not an acid.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to think about E and its symmetry.

Assuming E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). If E is a molecule like CO2, which is linear, then that's the symmetry group.

So, how would E be formed from C and D?

If E is CO2, then perhaps C is something that upon reaction with D produces CO2.

But I'm not sure about the rest of the reactions. Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, HCN is a linear molecule, yes. So it's symmetry group is D∞h. So option C.

So, if E is HCN, then how is it formed? Let's see.

C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio to form E (HCN). So C + 2 D → HCN.

What would C and D be?

HCN can be produced via reactions like the reaction of cyanide salts with strong acids. But I'm not sure if that fits the other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt, and D is a strong acid. So C (cyanide salt) + 2 HCl → HCN + NaCl, etc. But that's a possibility.

But wait, in the third reaction, C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. If C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN, then hydrolysis would produce HCN (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But according to the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So if the hydrolysis produces HCN (weak acid) and NaOH (base), then that doesn't fit because we have a base and an acid, but F and G are both acids.

Hmm, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is calcium cyanide, Ca(CN)2. Reacting with water would produce HCN and Ca(OH)2. So, Ca(CN)2 + 2 H2O → Ca(OH)2 + 2 HCN. So A would be Ca(OH)2 (a solid), F would be HCN (weak acid, so that's G), but then where is the strong acid F? Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride, like Ca3N2. Reacting with water would produce NH3 (a weak base) and Ca(OH)2. Again, no acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a phosphate salt. For example, Ca3(PO4)2. Reacting with water might not produce acids directly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate salt, like CaSO4. Hydrolysis might produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and Ca(OH)2 (base). That would give F as H2SO4 (strong acid) and G as nothing, but we need two acids. So that doesn't help.

Hmm. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to think of E as a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So possible candidates are CO2, HCN, NO2 (but that's bent), etc.

Wait, another thought: E could be a molecule like phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene's structure is a central carbon double-bonded to oxygen and with two chlorine atoms. So its structure is trigonal planar, which would have D3h symmetry, not D∞h. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, E could be ClF3. ClF3 is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry. So its symmetry group would be C2v (option D). But I'm not sure.

Wait, ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule. No, wait, ClF3 has three bonds and two lone pairs on the central chlorine atom, making it a trigonal pyramidal structure, which has a C3v symmetry group. Hmm, but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, another possibility: E is H2O. But H2O is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry (option D). But is it extremely hazardous? Well, in large quantities or high concentrations, water can be dangerous, but I'm not sure if that fits the description.

Alternatively, E could be a molecule like HClO (hypochlorous acid), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. But HClO is not extremely hazardous, though it is a strong oxidizer.

Wait, maybe E is a molecule like OCS (thioyl chloride), which has a structure similar to phosgene but with a sulfur atom. Its structure is O=C=S, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry. So if E is OCS, then the symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

How would E be formed? Let's think. C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E.

If E is OCS, then perhaps C is COS (carbonyl sulfide) and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, if D is H2S and C is something that upon reaction produces OCS. Not sure.

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that E has a D∞h symmetry group, making option C the answer.

But to make sure, let's think again about the reactions. If E is CO2, which is linear, then how would the reactions fit?

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → CO2. So C and D would have to supply the carbon and oxygen.

If C is a carbonate salt, and D is something that provides the necessary elements.

But I'm not making progress. Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like NH3, but that's not linear. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2, but those have D∞h symmetry. But I don't think those are products in this scenario.

Alternatively, E could be a molecule like H2O, which is bent (C2v symmetry). But I'm not sure.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the best guess is that E has D∞h symmetry, making option C the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry (1:8) suggests a high oxidation state for A, and the bright red color indicates a possible transition metal oxide or a compound like vanadium(IV) oxide (V₂O₅), which is reddish-brown.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. This suggests a transformation involving redox chemistry or a highly reactive intermediate. E is likely a toxic gas or a molecule with a linear structure, as linear molecules often exhibit high symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to produce A, F (a strong acid), and G (a weak acid). This indicates that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield acids. For example, if C is a nitrate or carbonate salt, hydrolysis could produce a strong acid (e.g., HNO₃ or H₂SO₄) and a weak acid (e.g., H₂CO₃).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B combine to form a common solvent like water (H₂O) or ethanol.

5. **Symmetry Group of E**: The options for the molecular symmetry group are:
   - **C2**: A twofold rotational symmetry.
   - **D4h**: A high-symmetry group with a combination of rotations, reflections, and inversions.
   - **D∞h**: The symmetry group of linear molecules like CO₂ or HCN.
   - **C2v**: A lower-symmetry group, often found in bent molecules like H₂O or HCl.

Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, it is likely a linear molecule with high symmetry. CO₂, for example, is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry and is consistent with the description of E. Other linear molecules like HCN also exhibit D∞h symmetry. Based on the reactions and the symmetry options, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
