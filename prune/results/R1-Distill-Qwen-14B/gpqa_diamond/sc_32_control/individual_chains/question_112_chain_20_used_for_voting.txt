Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, we're asked to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij, where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think I should figure out what the state |alpha> actually is. The problem says it's proportional to that combination, which probably means we can write |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. But since quantum states are defined up to a scalar multiple, we need to normalize them. So the first step is to normalize |alpha>.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should just get the state into its normalized form. Let's compute the normalization factor. The state is a sum of two terms, so the norm squared is the magnitude of (1+i) squared plus the magnitude of (2-i) squared.

Calculating each magnitude: |1+i| is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So the square is 2. Similarly, |2 - i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). So the square is 5.

Wait, wait. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 because the cross terms are zero? Or wait, no, because the state is a vector in a two-dimensional space, so the norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) )?

Wait, no, because the state is |up> and |down> which are orthonormal. So the norm is sqrt( |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 ), where c1 and c2 are coefficients. So for |alpha>, c1 is (1+i), c2 is (2-i).

Calculating |c1|²: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.

|c2|²: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the problem might not require normalization for the first part. Because the next part is about another operator, so perhaps the first part is just to find the probabilities for the given operator's eigenstates.

Wait, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, that's interesting. So for a 2x2 matrix, the operator A is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0      ]

Hmm, wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So what are the eigenstates of this operator?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the eigenstates of this operator, because the measurement probabilities would depend on the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

Wait, but wait. When you measure an observable (operator), the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state vector.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator A.

Let me write the matrix form of A:

A = (ħ/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So yes.

The matrix for A is ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix. Right, because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the eigenvalues of A would be the same as those of the Pauli X matrix, scaled by ħ/2.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but no. Because the Pauli X matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

So the eigenstates would be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. What are they?

The eigenstates of X are the states where when you apply X, you get ±1 times the state.

The eigenstates of X are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), right? Because X acting on (1,1)/sqrt(2) gives (0 1; 1 0)(1;1)/sqrt(2) = (1 +1)/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) times (1;1) / sqrt(2), no wait, let me compute properly.

Wait, X is [[0 1], [1 0]]. So for a vector (a, b), X (a, b)^T is (b, a)^T.

So suppose the eigenvalue is +1. So X |v> = +1 |v>.

So (b, a) = (a, b). So a = b. So the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1) for eigenvalues +1 and -1, up to normalization.

Wait, wait. Let me find the eigenvectors correctly.

Let me solve (A - λ I) v = 0.

So for λ = +1:

The matrix becomes [[ -1, 1], [1, -1]].

The equations are -v1 + v2 = 0, and v1 - v2 = 0. So v1 = v2. So the eigenvectors are (1,1), up to scaling. Similarly, for λ=-1, the matrix becomes [[1,1],[1,1]], leading to v1 = v2.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me recompute.

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So A - λ I = [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]].

The determinant is λ² - (ħ^2/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2. So yes, eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Then, the eigenvectors for λ= ħ/2:

We have (A - (ħ/2) I)|v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes [[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]].

The equations are (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ: -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are (1,1) up to a scalar. So the normalized eigenvectors are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2) for λ = ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, when λ = ħ/2, the equation is ( - ħ/2 ) v1 + ( ħ/2 ) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly, when λ = - ħ/2, the equation is ( ħ/2 ) v1 + ( ħ/2 ) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,-1).

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, wait no. The |up> and |down> are the standard basis vectors, so in their basis, the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), normalized.

Wait, but in this case, the operator A's eigenstates are |phi+> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |phi-> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), assuming |0> and |1> are the basis vectors. But in our case, the basis is |up> and |down>, which are the same as |0> and |1> perhaps.

So the eigenstates of A are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

Wait, no, wait. Because the operator A has matrix (0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0). So in the |up>, |down> basis, the eigenstates are |phi+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |phi-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Yes, because when you act A on |phi+>, you get (ħ/2)(|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) = (ħ/2) |phi+>.

So the eigenstates are |phi+> and |phi->, and the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So the problem is now to find the overlap between the given state |alpha> and each of these eigenstates, and then compute the probabilities.

But wait, in our case, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, but normalized. Earlier, we computed that the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So now, we need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates |phi+> and |phi->.

Let me compute the inner products.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |phi+> and |phi->.

Let me write |phi+> = ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, |phi-> = ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Express |alpha> as a linear combination: c1 |phi+> + c2 |phi->.

So, |alpha> = c1 (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

|alpha> = [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But from earlier, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So the coefficients must satisfy:

( c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) → equation (1).

( c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7) → equation (2).

We can solve equations (1) and (2) for c1 and c2.

Let me multiply both equations by sqrt(2):

Equation (1): c1 + c2 = (1 + i) sqrt(2)/ sqrt(7).

Equation (2): c1 - c2 = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/ sqrt(7).

Now, add equations (1) and (2):

2 c1 = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → 2c1 = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So c1 = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

2 c2 = [ (1 + i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → 2 c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So c2 = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute c1 and c2 using these linear equations.

Alternatively, we can compute c1 and c2 as the inner products of |alpha> with |phi+> and |phi->, respectively.

Wait, yes, because c1 = <phi+| alpha>, and c2 = <phi-| alpha>.

So let's compute c1 first.

c1 = <phi+| alpha> = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

c1 = [ ( <up| (1+i) |up> + <up| (2-i) |down> ) + ( <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2 -i)|down> ) ] / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

But <up|down> is zero, and <down|up> is zero. So cross terms are zero.

So,

c1 = [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <down|down> ) ] / sqrt(2 *7).

Wait, wait, No. Wait, let me compute this again.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all divided by sqrt(7).

So when we take the inner product with |phi+>, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), the inner product is:

<phi+| alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> ] + [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ].

Wait no, perhaps a better way is to compute it as:

<phi+| alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2-i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Since <up|down> = 0 and <down|up> = 0.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1.

So,

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) ].

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So,

c1 = 3/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c2 = <phi-| alpha>.

|phi-> is (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So,

<phi-| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up| down> - (1+i) <down| up> - (2 -i) <down| down> ] / sqrt(7).

Again, cross terms are zero.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Compute numerator:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 - 2) + (i + i ) = (-1) + 2i.

So numerator is (-1 + 2i).

So,

c2 = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ).

So, c2 = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |c1|^2, and the probability for -ħ/2 is |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2:

c1 = 3 / sqrt(14) → |c1|^2 = 9/14.

Compute |c2|^2:

c2 is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14.

Wait, but wait, no: the magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (sqrt(14))^2 → (1+4)/14 = 5/14.

Wait, but wait, 3/sqrt(14) squared is 9/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36.

So the probabilities are P(+ħ/2) = 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and P(-ħ/2)=5/14≈0.36.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation for c2.

c2 = <phi-| alpha> = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So |c2|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14. So yes.

So that's the probabilities.

Now the average value (expected value) of operator A is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

So E[A] = (ħ/2) * (9/14) + ( - ħ/2 ) * (5/14).

Which is (9/14 -5/14) * ħ/2 → (4/14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 → (2* ħ) / (7*2) ) → ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's what we found.

So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

- \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \).

The norm squared is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \hbar/2 \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|\phi_+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |\phi_-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring \( \pm \hbar/2 \), we calculate the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |\phi_+\rangle \) and \( |\phi_-\rangle \). The coefficients \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are given by:

\[
c_1 = \langle \phi_+ | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_2 = \langle \phi_- | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+\hbar/2) = |c_1|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\hbar/2) = |c_2|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} \right) + \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar/7 \).**
