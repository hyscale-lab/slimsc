Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties. My job is to find out which ones can be observed by both spectrographs based on their brightness. Oh wait, the question also mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. So a star needs to be brighter than 17 mag to be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait no, wait: the wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Oh, because lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is brighter than magnitude 17, it's observable. So the limit is V mag <=17 for ESPRESSO, and V mag <=16 for HIRES. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Wait, no. Wait: the question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, wait, no: "brighter than 17 mag" would mean magnitude less than 17. Because the magnitude scale is inverse. Like, lower magnitude is brighter. So, for instance, magnitude 1 is brighter than magnitude 10.

So, for a star to be observed by ESPRESSO, its apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 17. Because anything brighter (lower mag) than 17 is acceptable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag <=16.

So the star needs to have an apparent V mag less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, but that's not possible because if it's brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17. So a star that's detectable by HIRES must also be detectable by ESPRESSO, right? Because if it's brighter than 16 V, it's also brighter than 17 V.

Wait wait, but the question is about which stars can be detected by both. So any star that's below 16 V mag can be detected by both, because it's below both limits. But wait, the problem is that the apparent magnitudes of the stars are either given directly or need to be calculated.

So let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, at 10 pc. So apparent mag is same as absolute mag? Because at 10 pc, absolute and apparent mags are the same. So Star1 has apparent V mag 15.5. Since 15.5 is less than 17 and 16, it's observable by both. So Star1 could be a candidate.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5. So that's 16.5 mag. ESPRESSO can take up to 17, so 16.5 is acceptable. But HIRES only takes up to 16. So 16.5 is above 16, so HIRES can't observe it. So Star2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, but with E(B-V) = 0.6. Oh, wait, so there's interstellar extinction which makes the star appear dimmer. The problem says to calculate the total absorption in V band using E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1. So extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude is the original (before extinction) plus the extinction. Wait, no: the star's light is dimmed, so the apparent magnitude increases. So the observed (apparent) magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_V.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc, without any extinction. But in this case, Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V) =0.6. So we need to calculate the extinction in V band, which is 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86 mag. So the actual, unextincted apparent magnitude would be m_true = m_observed - A_V. Or wait, the star's light is absorbed, so the observed m is higher. So if a star's actual m is m_true, the observed is m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Because the extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the apparent magnitude increases. So for Star3, the apparent mag given is 15.5, but that's after extinction. So the true apparent mag without extinction would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. Wait, no, wait: if the star is at a certain distance, but with extinction, the apparent mag would be higher. So, if the star's intrinsic apparent mag (without extinction) is m, then after extinction, it's m + A_V. So in this case, Star3's given apparent mag is already the observed one, which includes the extinction. Wait, or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The star's actual brightness (without extinction) would be m_true, but because of extinction, it's dimmer, so when observed, the apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_V.

No, wait. The formula I remember is: m_observed = m_true + A_V. Because A_V is positive, so the observed magnitude is higher, meaning the star appears dimmer.

So Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is after extinction. So the m_true (without extinction) would be m_observed - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But that's the apparent magnitude without extinction. Wait, but for the purpose of the question, we need the star's apparent magnitude as observed. Because the telescopes' detection limits are based on observed apparent magnitude.

Wait, the question says, for example, Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the given apparent mag is 15.5, but that's including the extinction. So when you observe it, it's 15.5. So the actual star's light is dimmed, so without extinction, it would appear brighter. But for the purpose of determining if it's detectable, we need to see if m_observed <= 17 for ESPRESSO, and <=16 for HIRES.

So Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is less than 17 and 16. So it's detectable by both? Wait, but wait: because the star's light is dimmed, making it appear fainter. So if the apparent mag is 15.5, which is below both 17 and 16, so it can be observed by both. So Star3 can be detected by both. But wait, let me make sure: the given apparent mag is 15.5, which is after extinction. So the observed V mag is 15.5. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can observe it.

Wait, but in the case of Star4: the given is absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent mag is same as absolute, 15.5. But E(B-V) is 0.4. So A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 =1.24. So the observed apparent mag is m_observed = 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74 mag. Because the star's light is dimmed, making it appear fainter.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The absolute magnitude is M, which is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. But if the star is at 10 pc and has M=15.5, then without any extinction, its apparent magnitude is also 15.5. But with extinction A_V=1.24, the observed apparent mag is 15.5 +1.24 =16.74. So Star4's observed V mag is 16.74.

So for Star4, the apparent mag is 16.74. Then, for ESPRESSO, it's <=17? 16.74 is less than 17, so yes. For HIRES, it's <=16. 16.74 is larger than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. So Star4 can be observed by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So apparent mag is calculated using the distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10) = 5 log (5/10) =5 log(0.5) =5*(-0.3010)≈-1.505. So m = M + distance modulus =16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995, approximately 15.0 mag. So Star5's apparent V mag is 15.0. 

But wait, does extinction affect it? The problem statement for Star5 doesn't mention E(B-V), so I think we can assume no extinction. So Star5's apparent mag is 15.0.

So 15.0 is less than 17, so detectable by ESPRESSO, and less than 16, so detectable by HIRES. So Star5 can be observed by both.

Wait, but wait. Star4's observed magnitude after extinction is 16.74, which is above HIRES' limit of 16, so only ESPRESSO can see it.

Wait, let me list all the stars and their apparent V magnitudes, considering any extinction:

Star1: apparent V mag 15.5 (no extinction as it's absolute mag, located at 10 pc). So m=15.5. Both telescopes can see.

Star2: m=16.5 (apparent). ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't.

Star3: m=15.5 (apparent, which already includes extinction). Both can see.

Star4: m=15.5 (absolute) + extinction: A_V=1.24. So m_obs=15.5 +1.24 =16.74. So m=16.74. ESPRESSO can (<=17), HIRES can't (as 16.74 >16).

Star5: m=15.0 (no extinction). Both can see.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, looking at the options, the choices are:

A) Star4 and Star5: Star4 can't be seen by HIRES, so A is wrong.

B) Star3 and Star5: Both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3: Star2 can't be detected by HIRES, so C is wrong.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so D is wrong.

Wait, but in the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both spectrographs.

But let me double-check Star3. Star3: m_obs=15.5. So 15.5 is below both 17 and 16. So yes, detectable by both.

Star5: m=15.0, same.

So which options include both Star3 and Star5? Looking back at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check again.

Wait, the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is 16.74, can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is 16.5, can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer is B: Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits and any interstellar extinction. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc.  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent V magnitude equals the absolute V magnitude, so \( m_{\text{apparent}} = 15.5 \).  
   - This is ≤16, so it can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 16.5.  
   - This is >16, so it can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5, \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band is \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - The observed apparent magnitude is already given as 15.5, which includes the extinction.  
   - This is ≤16, so it can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc.  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent V magnitude equals the absolute V magnitude, so \( m_{\text{apparent}} = 15.5 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band is \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - The observed apparent magnitude is \( m_{\text{observed}} = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - This is >16, so it can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 16.5, distance = 5 pc.  
   - Distance modulus = \( 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = -1.505 \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude = \( m_{\text{apparent}} = 16.5 - 1.505 \approx 15.0 \).  
   - This is ≤16, so it can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**.
