Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly, but I'm not 100% sure. The main point is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx to some exponent.

Wait, what do I remember about parallax and star distribution? Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsec, at 2 parsecs, 0.5, and so on.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. I think it relates to how the density of stars changes with distance. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant in space, but when considering a range of parallax, it's related to the volume they occupy.

Wait, parallax is 1/distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if I'm considering a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that mean for the distance?

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if I have a small change in plx, say dplx, then the change in distance dd is related. Let's compute it: d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, not sure if I need that.

The number of stars in a shell between d and d+dd would be the volume of that shell times the number density. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars is proportional to d² dd.

But wait, since the question is about stars per unit parallax range, I need to express this in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But maybe I should express d in terms of plx and then find how the number relates to plx.

So, the number of stars N in a parallax range plx to plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those parallax values. Wait, no—each parallax corresponds to a distance, so a small change in plx corresponds to a shell at a certain distance.

So for a given plx, which is 1/d, the number of stars in the shell would be Volume * density. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So N ∝ d² dd.

But d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/(plx²). And dd is the change in distance, which can be expressed in terms of dplx. Wait, what's the relation between dd and dplx?

We have plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking differentials, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign just indicates direction, but for the magnitude, we can ignore it. So, dd = dplx / (plx^2) (since d is decreasing as plx increases).

So substituting back into N ∝ d² dd:

N ∝ (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) )

Wait, that's (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = dplx / plx^4.

Wait, but N is the number of stars in a parallax range dplx. So N is proportional to dplx / plx^4. But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so per dplx=1 (unit). So N ∝ 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because when plx increases (meaning closer stars), the number of stars in that range should be more, right? Because the volume of the shell is smaller, but the number density is the same. Wait, no, the volume of the shell is 4πd² dd. So as d increases, the volume increases with d squared. But if d is smaller (closer stars), the volume is smaller for a given dd.

Wait, but in our case, the change in plx is a fixed dplx, which corresponds to a larger change in d when plx is smaller (since d is 1/plx). So maybe I'm getting the relation wrong.

Let me think again. For a small change in plx, dplx, what's the corresponding change in d (distance). Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, the change in d is proportional to 1/plx². So, dd = (dplx)/(plx^2).

So, the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. Plugging in d=1/plx:

Volume = 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Since the number of stars is the volume multiplied by the number density (assuming uniform distribution), the number N is proportional to Volume, which is proportional to dplx / plx^4. So, for a unit range of plx (dplx=1), N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as 1/plx^4. That would mean option A is correct.

Wait, but is this correct? Because when plx is small (close stars), the number of stars in a unit plx range should be higher, because each unit plx corresponds to a larger volume (since for small plx, d is large, so the shell is bigger for a unit plx change). Wait, let me see.

Wait, no—because if plx is small (say, 0.1), then a change of 1 in plx is a big jump. Because d is 10 pc when plx is 0.1. So a change in plx of 1 would correspond to a change in d of (1/0.1^2) * dplx. Wait, earlier equation was dd = (dplx)/(plx^2). So when plx is small, dd is large. So the same dplx (unit) corresponds to a larger change in d when plx is small.

Wait, but in terms of the volume, the shell's volume is 4π d² dd. So for a fixed dplx, when plx is small, d is large, so d² is large, and dd is also larger (since d is 1/plx, plx^2 is small, so (dplx)/(plx^2) is large). So Volume is d^2 * dd which would be (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) → dplx / plx^4. So for a fixed dplx, the volume is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, that makes sense, because when plx is small (closer stars), the same change in plx (e.g., 1 unit) corresponds to a much larger volume (since the shell is further out and has a larger radius and a larger thickness in distance). So the volume increases, and thus the number of stars would be higher in that unit plx range. But according to the calculation, N ∝ 1/plx^4. So as plx decreases (like 0.1), N increases as 1/(0.1)^4 = 10000 times. That makes sense because the same unit of plx change (say, 0.1 to 0.2) actually corresponds to a much larger volume than a unit change at higher plx.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars per unit plx range changes with plx. So, when plx is large (like 10), the number per unit plx is small, because the shell is small in volume. When plx is small, each unit plx range contains more stars because the volume per unit plx is much larger.

So, the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a given range of parallax depends on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance, which is proportional to \( d^2 \, dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell in distance.

For a small change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \), the corresponding change in distance is \( dd = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume of the shell becomes proportional to:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto d^2 \, dd = \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\right) = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume of the shell (assuming a uniform distribution of stars), the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} = 1 \)) is proportional to:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This indicates that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
