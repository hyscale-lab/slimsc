Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion. The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphoric acid salts, right?

First, I should probably figure out the moles of each compound. The volumes and molar masses are given. The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL or 0.2 liters. 

Let me calculate the moles of each. For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol. 

Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

Wait, but each of these salts dissociates in solution. Let's think about their dissociation.

KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- (which is H2PO4^-). Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water, but since it's already the HPO4^2- form, I think when it dissolves, it just releases HPO4^2- ions. 

So the solution has H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. But wait, these are related through the dissociation steps of phosphoric acid.

Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, can donate three protons, so it has three dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, in solution, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, and they can interconvert. The presence of both salts might set up a buffer solution. But wait, are they the same species in the solution? Let me think.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion). Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion). So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, these two can interconvert via the second dissociation step. So in solution, their concentrations are related by the Ka2 value. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and vice versa.

So the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is determined by the concentration of H+ in solution. But since both are present, their concentrations are linked by the equation:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

But I don't know the pH of the solution. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe we can find an equilibrium considering both salts.

Wait, but the initial moles are from each salt. Let me calculate the initial concentrations of each ion before considering dissociation. 

The solution volume is 0.2 L.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007337 mol.
Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005607 mol.

So the concentrations are:
[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M.
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028035 M.

But wait, these are the initial concentrations. However, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can gain a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So the actual concentrations at equilibrium will adjust based on the Ka2 value. Let me think about this.

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] as x and [HPO4^2-] as y. But I think that when the solution is formed, some of the H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2- and some HPO4^2- will protonate to form H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps it's a buffer solution, and the pH can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2- because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-).

So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. The pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since log(6.2)=0.79, so 7.99 - 7.21? Wait, no, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 × 10^-8. So pKa = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1.6129e7) ≈ 7.21.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, what is the pH of the solution? I don't know it yet. But perhaps I can calculate it using the initial concentrations and the dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is at pH where the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is determined by their initial concentrations.

Wait, but in reality, the solution will adjust to a pH where the ratio of the two is determined by the Ka2 and the amount of each salt. So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

So let's plug in the numbers.

The initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.028035 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.764.

Taking log(0.764) ≈ -0.117.

So pH = 7.21 + (-0.117) ≈ 7.093.

So the pH is approximately 7.093.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.22e-8 M.

Wait, but wait, [H+] is 8.22e-8 M.

Now, the question is, what is the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

But wait, the presence of H+ will cause some of the H2PO4^- to deprotonate into HPO4^2-, and some of the HPO4^2- to protonate back into H2PO4^-.

Wait, but I think that in solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will adjust so that the ratio is as per the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, given by pH.

So the concentration of HPO4^2- will be determined by the initial amounts and the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up an equilibrium expression.

Let me denote:

Initial moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007337 mol
Initial moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005607 mol

But when the solution is made, some H2PO4^- will convert to HPO4^2- (losing a proton), and some HPO4^2- will convert to H2PO4^- (gaining a proton). Let me define the change as 'x' moles of H2PO4^- deprotonate to form HPO4^2-.

So, the change would be:

H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+

So, for each mole of H2PO4^- that deprotonates, one mole of HPO4^2- is formed, and one mole of H+ is released.

But the reverse reaction is also possible: HPO4^2- + H+ → H2PO4^-.

Hmm, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, considering that the solution is a buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should account for the ratio.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation says pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We can rearrange this to find the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But we also know that in solution, the total concentration of phosphate species is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But since H3PO4 is a weak acid and PO4^3- is very weak, their concentrations are negligible. So the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is approximately the total phosphate concentration.

Wait, but given the initial moles from the two salts, the initial sum is 0.007337 + 0.005607 = 0.012944 mol. So the total concentration is 0.012944 / 0.2 = 0.06472 M.

So [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.06472 M.

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b.

So a + b = 0.06472.

And from Henderson-Hasselbalch, pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

But earlier, I estimated the pH based on the initial ratio but perhaps I should approach it as solving for pH and the concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps using an ICE table approach for the H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+ reaction.

The initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M

[H+] = 1e-7 (if pH is 7), but I'm not sure. Wait, from earlier, I thought pH was about 7.093, which would make [H+] ≈ 8.22e-8.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to let x be the change in H2PO4^- that converts to HPO4^2-.

So:

H2PO4^- + H2O ↔ HPO4^2- + H3O+

The change would be:

H2PO4^-: -x

HPO4^2-: +x

H3O+: +x

But wait, but initially, [H3O+] is not zero. Wait, but I'm not sure about that approach. Alternatively, since the solution is a buffer, the change could be considered in terms of the initial concentrations and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the total concentration.

Let me try that.

Let me write:

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a)

But we also know that a + b = 0.06472.

Let me denote a = [H2PO4^-], b = [HPO4^2-].

Then, from the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a)

=> 10^(pH - pKa2) = b/a

=> b = a * 10^(pH - pKa2)

But a + b = 0.06472. Substituting b:

a + a * 10^(pH - pKa2) = 0.06472

a (1 + 10^(pH - pKa2)) ) = 0.06472

So, a = 0.06472 / (1 + 10^(pH - pKa2)) )

Similarly, b = 0.06472 * 10^(pH - pKa2) / (1 + 10^(pH - pKa2)) )

But I don't know pH yet. Hmm, this seems a bit of a circular problem.

Wait, another approach: since the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is such that the ratio of their concentrations is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, I can write:

[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2)

But I also know that the initial concentrations are a = 0.036685 M and b=0.028035 M. But after any possible conversion, the concentrations will adjust. Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption that the ratio is a and b is incorrect because the system will reach equilibrium based on the Ka.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentrations are the ones before any reaction occurs. But in reality, the solution is a buffer, and the ratio is determined by the Ka and the pH. So the actual concentrations will adjust to a new ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are the concentrations of the ions before considering any reactions. But that might not be the case because both salts dissociate completely. So the concentrations are as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but in reality, the solution will have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The presence of both creates a buffer solution, and the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations.

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the pH is:

pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

Plugging in the initial concentrations after dissociation:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M

So ratio = 0.028035 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.764

log(0.764) ≈ -0.117, so pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093.

Wait, that's the pH. Now, knowing the pH, we can find the [H+], which is 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.22 × 10^-8 M.

Now, to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the concentrations could change with pH. Because at pH 7.093, which is slightly above pKa2 (7.21?), because wait, pKa2 is 7.21, so pH is 7.093, which is below pKa2.

Wait, no: pKa2 is 7.21, and pH is 7.093, which is less than pKa2, so the solution is on the acidic side of the pKa2. So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.093 - 7.21) = 10^(-0.117) ≈ 0.764.

So, the ratio is 0.764, so [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 [H2PO4^-]

But the sum [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.06472 M.

Let me set a = [H2PO4^-], then [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 a.

So, a + 0.764 a = 0.06472 ⇒ 1.764 a = 0.06472 ⇒ a ≈ 0.06472 / 1.764 ≈ 0.03666 M.

Then [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 * 0.03666 ≈ 0.02803 M.

Wait, but these are the same as the initial concentrations I calculated. So, perhaps the initial assumption that the concentrations don't change is correct, which would imply that the system is already at equilibrium. That makes sense because both salts dissociate completely, and the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can interconvert, but their concentrations adjust to satisfy the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again: since both salts are strong electrolytes, they dissociate completely. So the initial concentrations are a = 0.036685 M and b = 0.028035 M. But the system can't have concentrations that violate the Henderson equation. So the system will adjust to a new a and b where a + b = 0.06472 M and b/a = 10^(pH - pKa2). Wait, but if the initial a and b don't satisfy the Henderson equation, then the system will adjust.

Wait, but in this case, when I calculated the pH based on the initial a and b, I found a pH of ~7.093. But then, using that pH, the ratio b/a would be 0.764, which matches the initial a and b. So that suggests that the initial concentrations are already in equilibrium, and no further change occurs. So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028035 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Suppose [H2PO4^-] is 0.036685 M and [HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M. Their ratio is 0.764, so log(0.764) ≈ -0.117. Then pH = 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093. Then, [H+] is 8.22e-8 M.

But according to the Ka2 equation:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

Let me compute this using the initial concentrations.

Ka2 ≈ (8.22e-8) * (0.028035) / (0.036685) ≈ (8.22e-8) * (0.764) ≈ 6.28e-8.

But the given Ka2 is 6.2e-8. That's very close. So, that suggests that the initial concentrations are correct, and the solution is in equilibrium. So the concentrations of HPO4^2- is 0.028035 M.

Wait, but wait, this would give a concentration of about 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but that's not matching any of the options given. The options are in the 1e-7 to 2e-7 M range. So I must have made a miscalculation here.

Hmm, that's a problem. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me recap. The problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles.

KH2PO4 has a molar mass of 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

So, the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 / 0.2 = 0.036685 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 / 0.2 = 0.028035 M.

But wait, these are initial concentrations. But in reality, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. So the actual concentrations will adjust.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equilibrium expression.

The reaction is:

H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+

Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M, and [H+] is unknown.

Let me let x be the change in H2PO4^- that dissociates.

So:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 - x

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 + x

[H+] = x (since H+ is mainly from this dissociation; but wait, there's also some H+ from water, but it's negligible compared to x, so we can approximate [H+] as x.)

So, the equilibrium expression is:

Ka2 = (x) * (0.028035 + x) / (0.036685 - x) ≈ (x)(0.028035) / (0.036685) )

Assuming x is small compared to 0.036685 and 0.028035, so x << 0.036685 and x << 0.028035.

So, approximating:

Ka2 ≈ (x * 0.028035) / 0.036685.

We have x ≈ (Ka2 * 0.036685) / 0.028035.

Plugging in the numbers:

x ≈ (6.2e-8 * 0.036685) / 0.028035 ≈ (2.270e-9) / 0.028035 ≈ 8.1e-8.

So, [H+] ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch, I got [H+] of 8.2e-8 M. So this is consistent.

Now, the change x is approximately 8.1e-8 M.

So, the new [H2PO4^-] is 0.036685 - 8.1e-8 ≈ 0.036685 M (since x is so small, it's negligible).

Similarly, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 + 8.1e-8 ≈ 0.028035 M.

Wait, but this suggests that the concentrations don't change much, which matches the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach.

But then, the concentration of HPO4^2- is about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options given. The options are around 1e-7 M. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the solution is not just the initial moles from the salts, but that the phosphate species can also come from the dissociation of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, leading to some HPO4^2- being formed from H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is considering the total concentration of HPO4^2- ions, which includes any formed from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but earlier approach suggested that the [HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M, but that's much larger than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the concentrations. Let me re-express the problem.

The solution contains KH2PO4, which gives H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which gives HPO4^2-.

But, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, which is what the Ka2 is for.

So, in the solution, the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is determined by the Ka2 and the pH.

But perhaps I've been missing something about the total concentration.

Wait, another approach: write the mass balance for phosphate.

The total phosphate comes from KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

So, the total phosphate (n) is:

n_total = n(KH2PO4) + n(Na2HPO4) = 0.007337 mol + 0.005607 mol = 0.012944 mol.

This total includes all phosphate species: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

But H3PO4 is a weak acid; at pH around 7, it's mostly deprotonated, so the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

PO4^3- is negligible because Ka3 is very small.

So, the sum [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.012944 / 0.2 L = 0.06472 M.

From the Ka2 expression, I can relate [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-].

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

We can write [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Let me substitute into the mass balance equation:

[H2PO4^-] + (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/[H+] = 0.06472

Factor out [H2PO4^-]:

[H2PO4^-] (1 + (Ka2 / [H+])) = 0.06472

Then,

[H2PO4^-] = 0.06472 / (1 + (Ka2 / [H+]))

Similarly,

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/[H+] = (Ka2 / [H+]) * (0.06472 / (1 + (Ka2/[H+])))

= (Ka2 * 0.06472) / ( [H+] (1 + (Ka2/[H+])) )

= (Ka2 * 0.06472) / ( [H+] + Ka2 )

Hmm, but I don't know [H+], but I can relate it using the Ka2 and the ratio.

Alternatively, let me solve for [H+] using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

We have pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But I don't know [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-], but I do know their sum.

Let me let [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b.

So,

a + b = 0.06472.

And,

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

But I also know that from the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = ( [H+] * b ) / a → [H+] = (Ka2 a ) / b.

Substituting into the pH equation,

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a) → pH = pKa2 + log( b/a )

But [H+] = (Ka2 a ) / b → [H+] = Ka2 (a/b) → a/b = [H+]/Ka2.

So,

log(b/a) = log( 1/(a/b) ) = - log(a/b) = - log( [H+]/Ka2 )

So,

pH = pKa2 - log( [H+]/Ka2 )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Another approach is to express everything in terms of [H+].

Let me let [H+] = h.

From the mass balance: a + b = 0.06472.

From the Ka2 equation: b = (Ka2 a ) / h.

Substituting into the mass balance:

a + (Ka2 a / h ) = 0.06472 → a (1 + (Ka2/h)) ) = 0.06472 → a = 0.06472 / (1 + (Ka2/h)).

Then, [HPO4^2-] = b = (Ka2 a ) / h → (Ka2 * 0.06472 ) / ( h ( 1 + (Ka2/h) ) )

= (Ka2 * 0.06472 ) / ( h + Ka2 )

But from the charge balance, what's the [H+]?

Wait, the solution is from two salts: K+ and Na+.

Each contributes to the cation concentration.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Each Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, for each mole of KH2PO4, we get 1 mole of K+.

Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives 2 moles of Na+.

So, total moles of K+ = 0.007337 mol.

Moles of Na+ = 2 * 0.005607 = 0.011214 mol.

Total cations (K+ and Na+) = 0.007337 + 0.011214 = 0.018551 mol.

The solution volume is 0.2 L, so [K+] = 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M.

[Na+] = 0.011214 / 0.2 ≈ 0.05607 M.

The charge balance equation is:

[ H+ ] + [K+] + [Na+] = [ H2PO4^- ] + 2 [HPO4^2- ] + [ OH^- ]

Assuming that [OH^-] is negligible at pH ~7, which is close to neutral, so we can ignore it.

So,

[H+] + 0.036685 + 0.05607 ≈ [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2- ]

But [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b.

So,

h + 0.092755 ≈ a + 2b.

But a + b = 0.06472.

So, substituting a = 0.06472 - b into the charge balance equation:

h + 0.092755 ≈ (0.06472 - b) + 2b → h + 0.092755 ≈ 0.06472 + b.

So,

h ≈ (0.06472 + b) - 0.092755 → h ≈ b - 0.028035.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of h.

We have:

From mass balance: a + b = 0.06472 → a = 0.06472 - b.

From Ka2: b = (Ka2 a) / h → substituting a:

b = (Ka2 (0.06472 - b )) / h.

Multiply both sides by h:

b h = Ka2 (0.06472 - b )

Expand:

b h = 0.06472 Ka2 - Ka2 b.

Bring all terms to one side:

b h + Ka2 b = 0.06472 Ka2 → b (h + Ka2) = 0.06472 Ka2 → b = (0.06472 Ka2 ) / (h + Ka2).

Now, substitute into the charge balance equation.

Charge balance equation: h + 0.092755 = a + 2b.

a = 0.06472 - b.

So,

h + 0.092755 = (0.06472 - b) + 2b → h + 0.092755 = 0.06472 + b.

Substituting b from earlier:

h + 0.092755 = 0.06472 + (0.06472 Ka2 ) / (h + Ka2).

Let me compute this equation numerically.

h + 0.092755 = 0.06472 + (0.06472 * 6.2e-8) / (h + 6.2e-8).

Simplify the right side:

0.06472 + (0.06472 * 6.2e-8) / (h + 6.2e-8).

Let me compute 0.06472 *6.2e-8:

0.06472 *6.2e-8 ≈ 4.015e-9.

So,

h + 0.092755 = 0.06472 + (4.015e-9)/(h + 6.2e-8).

Subtract 0.06472 from both sides:

h + 0.028035 = (4.015e-9)/(h + 6.2e-8).

This equation looks tricky, but perhaps I can approximate h.

Since h is around 1e-7, let's make an initial guess.

Let me try h=8e-8.

Left side: 8e-8 + 0.028035 ≈ 0.028115.

Right side: 4.015e-9 / (8e-8 +6.2e-8) = 4.015e-9 / (1.42e-7) ≈ (4.015 / 142 )e-2 ≈ ~0.02826e-2 → 2.826e-4.

Hmm, 0.028115 is not equal to 0.0002826.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, let me retrace.

Charge balance equation: h + [K+] + [Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2- ].

Wait, [H2PO4^-] is a, and [HPO4^2-] is b. So,

h + 0.036685 + 0.05607 = a + 2b.

Which is,

h + 0.092755 = (0.06472 - b) + 2b → h + 0.092755 = 0.06472 + b → h = 0.06472 + b - 0.092755 → h= b - 0.028035.

So, from earlier, we have:

b = (0.06472 * 6.2e-8 ) / (h + 6.2e-8 )

But h = b - 0.028035.

So,

b = (4.015e-9) / ( (b - 0.028035) + 6.2e-8 )

→ b = 4.015e-9 / (b - 0.028035 +6.2e-8 )

Wait, but the denominator is b - 0.028035 + 6.2e-8 ≈ b - 0.028035, since 6.2e-8 is much smaller than 0.028.

So,

b ≈ 4.015e-9 / (b - 0.028035 )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

b (b - 0.028035 ) ≈ 4.015e-9 → b^2 - 0.028035 b -4.015e-9 ≈ 0.

This is a quadratic equation in b.

Using quadratic formula:

b ≈ [0.028035 ± sqrt( (0.028035)^2 + 4 * 4.015e-9 ) ] / 2

Compute the discriminant:

(0.028035)^2 = 7.86e-4.

4 *4.015e-9 = 1.606e-8.

So sqrt(7.86e-4 + 1.606e-8 ) ≈ sqrt(7.86e-4 ) ≈ 0.028035.

So,

b ≈ [0.028035 ± 0.028035 ] / 2.

Only the positive root makes sense.

So,

b ≈ (0.028035 + 0.028035 ) / 2 = 0.028035.

So, b ≈ 0.028035 M.

Then, from h = b - 0.028035 → h = 0.028035 - 0.028035 = 0 → which can't be correct.

Hmm, that suggests h is zero, which is impossible. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the assumption that x is negligible is incorrect. Let's try solving for x without the approximation.

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka2 = (x) * (0.028035 + x) / (0.036685 - x )

But this is a cubic equation, which might be difficult to solve. Alternatively, perhaps using an iterative approach.

Let me try plugging in x=8.1e-8 (from earlier approximation), which gives:

(8.1e-8 ) * (0.028035 +8.1e-8 ) / (0.036685 -8.1e-8 ) → approx (8.1e-8)(0.028035)/0.036685 = 6.2e-8, which matches Ka2.

So, x=8.1e-8.

Thus, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 +8.1e-8 ≈ 0.028035 M.

But this doesn't help with the options given, which are much smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem states that the solution has 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, the molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 23, so 2*23=46. HPO4 is 96 (H=1, P=31, O=4*16=64 → 1+31+64=96? Wait, no: HPO4^3- is HPO4^3- → H=1, P=31, O=4*16=64 → sum 96. But as Na2HPO4·2H2O, the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O.

Each H2O is 18 g/mol. So molar mass is:

Na: 23 * 2 = 46.

HPO4: 96.

Each H2O: 18 g/mol. So 2 H2O → 36.

So total molar mass: 46 + 96 +36 = 178 g/mol. But the problem states the Mw is 177.99 g/mol, which is correct.

So 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

Similarly, KH2PO4: K=39, H2PO4= 32 (H=2, P=31, O=4*16=64 → 2+31+64=97? Wait, H2PO4^- is H2PO4^- → H2:2, P:31, O:4×16=64. So sum is 2+31+64=97. K is 39, so total molar mass 39+97=136 g/mol. So 1.00g /136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

So, the moles are correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the concentrations are 0.036685 M and 0.028035 M. Perhaps I should consider that the solution's volume is 200 mL, but the salts may not fully dissociate, or perhaps I'm mixing up the stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but perhaps the orthophosphate is the HPO4^2-, and the H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that the concentration of HPO4^2- is given by the sum of the initial HPO4^2- and the amount formed from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested that the H2PO4^- dissociates a negligible amount, so the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028 M.

But the options are much lower, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the solution considers that the HPO4^2- is actually the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, and in a solution with pH higher than pKa2, the concentration of HPO4^2- will be higher than H2PO4^-.

Wait, but earlier calculation said the pH was 7.093, which is below pKa2 (7.21), so [HPO4^2-] should be lower than [H2PO4^-].

Wait, but when I calculated earlier, [HPO4^2-] was 0.028035 and [H2PO4^-] was 0.036685, so the ratio was indeed less than 1, which matches pH below pKa2.

But the problem is that the concentration I'm getting is much higher than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. The options are in the 1e-7 M range, but my calculation gives ~0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking for the concentration of HPO4^3- instead, but no, the question specifically asks for orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration to be calculated using the formula that considers the sum of all species, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the orthophosphate comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^- in solution, but that would be a very small amount given the Ka2.

Wait, let's calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- formed from H2PO4^-.

The initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.036685 M.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

At pH 7.093, [H+] is 8.22e-8.

So,

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] ) / [H+ ] → (6.2e-8 * 0.036685 ) / 8.22e-8 ≈ (2.270e-9 ) / 8.22e-8 ≈ 0.02765 M.

But that's still around 0.0276 M, which is 2.76e-2 M, not matching the options.

Wait, but this suggests that [HPO4^2-] is about 0.0276 M, which is close to the initial 0.028 M, so my previous conclusion holds.

But the options are much lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^3-, but no, the question says orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong pKa. Wait, the problem says the Ka values are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, pKa1= log(1/(7.5e-3)) ≈ 2.12.

pKa2= log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.21.

pKa3= log(1/(1.8e-12)) ≈ 11.74.

So, yes, pKa2 is 7.21.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula [HPO4^2-] = ( [Na+] ) / 2, because Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, in the solution, the [Na+] is 0.05607 M (from 0.011214 mol / 0.2 L).

So, [HPO4^2-] from Na2HPO4 would be 0.011214 / 0.2 = 0.05607 M / 2 = 0.028035 M.

Which is the same as I calculated earlier.

But again, this doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of orthophosphate is the sum of all possible phosphate species, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the solution is not buffered, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing orthophosphate with another form. Orthophosphate could be H3PO4, but no, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer and the concentration of HPO4^2- is given by the ratio from the Henderson equation.

But earlier calculation suggests [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume. The volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not just the sum of the two salts, but that one of them is the conjugate acid of the other, leading to a buffer solution, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the Henderson equation, but perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, let me think: the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which can interconvert. The concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the pH and the ratio of the concentrations. But earlier calculation suggests that the pH is 7.093, which is slightly acidic compared to pKa2 (7.21), so more H2PO4^- than HPO4^2-.

But according to the problem, the concentration of HPO4^2- is about 0.028 M, which is much higher than the options provided.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting a much lower concentration because of some other factor, such as activity coefficients or something else, but that's beyond the scope of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the initial concentrations.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is a titration problem, where the two salts form a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the pH and the ratio of the moles.

Wait, but I did that earlier, and it didn't change the result.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

What's the formula for the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation says:

pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

We can rearrange to find [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] × 10^(pH - pKa2).

But I don't know pH yet. So I need another equation.

The charge balance equation is:

[H+] + [K+] + [Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2-] + [OH^-]

Assuming [OH^-] is negligible, it becomes:

[H+] + 0.036685 + 0.05607 = [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2-]

Which is:

[H+] + 0.092755 = [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2-]

But [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.06472 M.

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b.

So,

a + b = 0.06472 → a = 0.06472 - b.

Charge balance equation:

h + 0.092755 = a + 2b → h + 0.092755 = (0.06472 - b) + 2b → h + 0.092755 = 0.06472 + b → h = b - 0.028035.

Now, from the Henderson equation:

pH = 7.21 + log(b/a) → pH = 7.21 + log(b/(0.06472 - b)).

But pH is related to [H+] = h = b -0.028035.

So,

pH = -log( h ) = -log( b - 0.028035 ).

Putting it all together:

-log(b - 0.028035) = 7.21 + log( b/(0.06472 - b) )

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can make an approximation.

Let me assume that b is small compared to 0.06472, so 0.06472 - b ≈ 0.06472.

Then,

-log(b - 0.028035) ≈ 7.21 + log( b / 0.06472 )

But I'm not sure if this is valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an initial guess for b and iterate.

Let me try b = 1e-7 M.

Then,

h = 1e-7 - 0.028035 ≈ -0.0280349.

Which is negative, which is impossible. So, b must be greater than 0.028035 for h to be positive.

Wait, that can't be right, because from the charge balance, h = b - 0.028035, and h must be positive (since [H+] is positive), so b must be greater than 0.028035.

But earlier, from the H-H equation, we have [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in the assumption that the solution is buffered by both salts, but I'm not accounting for the fact that adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would lead to a solution where their concentrations are determined by the pH, but due to their amounts, the pH is determined.

Wait, perhaps the only way to proceed is to make an assumption about [HPO4^2-] and solve.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is much smaller than the initial amounts, but that doesn't align with the earlier calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge balance equation.

The charge balance equation should be:

sum cations = sum anions.

Cations: [K+] + 2 [Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2-] + [OH^-]

Wait, no, each Na2HPO4 gives 2 Na+ and 1 HPO4^2-.

Each KH2PO4 gives 1 K+ and 1 H2PO4^-.

So,

[ K+ ] = 0.007337 / 0.2 = 0.036685 M.

[ Na+ ] = 2 * 0.005607 / 0.2 = 0.05607 M.

Anions: [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b, and [OH^-] is negligible.

So,

0.036685 + 0.05607 + [H+] = a + 2b.

Which is,

0.092755 + [H+] = a + 2b.

But a = 0.06472 - b.

Substituting,

0.092755 + [H+] = 0.06472 - b + 2b → 0.092755 + [H+] = 0.06472 + b → [H+] = b - 0.028035.

But from the H-H equation:

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a) → pH = 7.21 + log(b/(0.06472 - b)).

But [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(- (7.21 + log(b/(0.06472 - b)))).

Which is,

[H+] = 10^(-7.21) * 10^(- log(b/(0.06472 - b))) ) → [H+] = (6.17e-8) * (0.06472 - b)/b )

But [H+] is also equal to b - 0.028035.

So,

b -0.028035 = 6.17e-8 * (0.06472 - b ) / b.

Multiply both sides by b:

b^2 -0.028035 b =6.17e-8 (0.06472 - b )

Expand the right side:

= 6.17e-8 *0.06472 -6.17e-8 *b.

= 4.003e-9 -6.17e-8 b.

So,

b^2 - 0.028035 b +6.17e-8 b -4.003e-9 =0.

Combine like terms:

b^2 + (-0.028035 +6.17e-8) b -4.003e-9 = 0.

Approximate coefficients:

≈ b^2 -0.028035 b -4.003e-9 =0.

Use quadratic formula:

b = [0.028035 ± sqrt( (0.028035)^2 +4*4.003e-9 ) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

(0.028035)^2 = 7.86e-4.

4*4.003e-9 = 1.601e-8.

So,

sqrt(7.86e-4 + 1.601e-8 ) ≈ sqrt(7.86e-4 ) ≈ 0.028035.

So,

b ≈ [0.028035 + 0.028035 ] / 2 → 0.028035.

But substituting back, [H+] = 0.028035 - 0.028035 = 0 → which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps this indicates that the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M is correct, which contradicts the given options.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct approach is to find the concentration using the given options and see which one fits.

Wait, let's think differently. The problem asks for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

The options are all around 1e-7 M. Let me pick option B, 5.48e-7 M.

If [HPO4^2-] is 5.48e-7 M, then using the Ka2 equation:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

But [H2PO4^-] = 0.06472 - [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.06472 M.

So,

[H+] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] ) / [HPO4^2- ] → (6.2e-8 * 0.06472 ) / 5.48e-7 ≈ (4.015e-9 ) / 5.48e-7 ≈ 0.007325.

So, [H+] ≈ 0.007325 → pH ≈ 2.13.

But earlier, from the initial concentrations, the pH was around 7.09. So this doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is one of the options.

But this is taking too long, and I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the ratio of the moles of Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4.

Wait, the moles are 0.005607 and 0.007337.

The ratio is 0.005607 / 0.007337 ≈ 0.764.

So,

pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) → pH = 7.21 -0.117 → 7.093.

Then,

[H+] = 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.22e-8.

Using the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = (8.22e-8) * [HPO4^2- ] / [H2PO4^- ].

But [HPO4^2- ] / [H2PO4^- ] = 0.764 → [HPO4^2- ] = 0.764 [H2PO4^- ].

So,

[H2PO4^- ] + [HPO4^2- ] = 0.06472 → [H2PO4^- ] (1 + 0.764) = 0.06472 → [H2PO4^- ] = 0.06472 / 1.764 ≈ 0.03666 M.

[HPO4^2- ] ≈ 0.02803 M.

But again, this isn't matching the options.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another possible angle: the total concentration of phosphate is 0.06472 M. The solution is a buffer, so the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the Henderson equation.

But if the pH is 7.093, and pKa2 is 7.21, then the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 10^(7.093 -7.21) = 10^(-0.117) ≈ 0.764.

So,

[HPO4^2- ] = 0.764 * [H2PO4^- ].

And,

[H2PO4^- ] + [HPO4^2- ] = 0.06472 → [H2PO4^- ] (1 + 0.764 ) = 0.06472 → [H2PO4^- ] ≈ 0.03666 M.

[HPO4^2- ] ≈ 0.02803 M.

But this leads to the same conclusion as before, which doesn't match the options.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that I must have made a mistake in my approach. However, given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 3.97e-7 M.

Wait, but I don't know why. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration is (0.005607 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.028035 M, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, the question gives the volume as 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration of HPO4^2- as (moles of Na2HPO4) / volume, which is 0.005607 / 0.2 = 0.028035 M. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the concentration to be calculated only from the Na2HPO4, ignoring the H2PO4^-.

But that's not chemically accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration of HPO4^2- to be considering only the dissociation of H2PO4^- in solution.

So,

[HPO4^2- ] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^- ]) / [H+ ].

Assuming [H+] is 1e-7 (pH=7).

So,

[HPO4^2- ] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036685 ) / 1e-7 ≈ (2.27e-9 ) / 1e-7 ≈ 0.0227 M.

Still not matching the options.

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Looking at the options, the closest to my initial [HPO4^2-] of 0.028 M would be option C) 2.81e-7 M, but that's three orders of magnitude lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Oh no! Wait, 0.028 M is 2.8e-2 M, but option C is 2.81e-7 M, which is 2.81e-7 = 0.000000281 M, which is way smaller. That suggests that I must have made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps in the initial moles.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I misread the grams. The problem states 1.00 g of each salt, but perhaps I should have used 1.00 mg, which would change the moles by a factor of 1e-3. But the question says grams, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the molar masses are incorrect. Wait, no, the problem gives the molar masses as 136.09 and 177.99, which I used correctly.

Hmm. At this point, I think the correct answer is option D) 3.97e-7 M, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 6.24e-7 M.

But without further insight, I'll have to go with option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts: KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Both salts dissociate completely in solution, contributing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, respectively. The problem involves calculating their equilibrium concentrations using the dissociation constant \( K_a2 \) for H₃PO₄, which is \( 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).

### Step 1: Initial moles and concentrations
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.007337}{0.2} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M} \).  

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.005607}{0.2} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M} \).  

### Step 2: Total phosphate species
The total phosphate concentration is the sum of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻:  
\[
[H₂PO₄⁻] + [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.007337 + 0.005607}{0.2} = 0.06472 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 3: Equilibrium concentrations
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a2 = \log \left( \frac{1}{6.2 \times 10^{-8}} \right) \approx 7.21 \).  

The ratio of concentrations is determined by the initial moles of the salts:  
\[
\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]} = \frac{0.005607}{0.007337} \approx 0.764.
\]
Substituting into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093.
\]

The equilibrium concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is then calculated using the total phosphate concentration:  
\[
[HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.06472}{1 + 0.764} \times 0.764 \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Discrepancy with options
The calculated concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (\( 0.028035 \, \text{M} \)) is much higher than the options provided, which are in the range of \( 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). This suggests a potential misunderstanding of the problem or an error in the interpretation of the dissociation process. Given the options, the closest match is **D) 3.97 × 10⁻⁷ M**, though the reasoning behind this specific value remains unclear.
