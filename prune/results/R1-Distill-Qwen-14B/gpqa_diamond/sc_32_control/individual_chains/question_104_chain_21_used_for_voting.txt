Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets. Hmm, let's see. The question says that two stars have the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. They used the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The problem gives me the shift in the spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravity causing the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us. So, a larger shift would mean a higher velocity.

The formula I think is involved here relates the Doppler shift to the velocity. The Doppler shift (delta lambda) is proportional to velocity (v) times the wavelength (lambda), right? The formula is delta lambda = v * lambda / c, where c is the speed of light. Or wait, maybe it's delta lambda / lambda = v/c. So, delta lambda is proportional to v.

So if Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms and Planet #2 causes 7, then the velocity ratio is 5/7. Because the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity. So the velocity of the star due to Planet #1 is (5/7) times that of Planet #2.

Wait, but in the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ... but wait, when the planet mass is much smaller than the star, like Neptune is much less than the Sun, then M_p can be neglected, so K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (P/(2π))^(−1/3) ), maybe? Or wait, no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * 2π ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so K ≈ (G^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π P^(1/3))) )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. But since the two stars have the same mass, and both planets are similar to Neptune, so M_p is same for both. Also, the inclination i is similar, but I think the problem assumes that both have similar i (like edge-on), but I'm not sure. But since the problem says the shift is exactly 5 and 7, maybe we don't have to worry about i.

Wait, but the Doppler shift is K multiplied by the wavelength, right? So the measured delta lambda is proportional to K. Because the Doppler effect formula is delta lambda = (v/c) * lambda, so delta lambda is proportional to v, which is K.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*)^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(P)) )? Wait, no, I think I should recall the correct formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (G P )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * 2π c )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Alternatively, from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Because, rearranging the formula:

K ≈ ( (G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) )

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(P)) )? Wait, P is in the denominator as 1/P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, so for two planets, K1 and K2, we have:

K1/K2 = ( (M_p1) / (M_*1^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P1^(1/3)) ) ) / ( (M_p2) / (M_*2^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3)) ) )

But in our problem, M_*1 = M_*2 (same mass as Sun), and M_p1 = M_p2 (both Neptune masses). So this ratio becomes K1/K2 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) ) / (1 / P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, from the problem, the Doppler shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstrom. Since delta lambda is proportional to K, then K1/K2 =5/7.

So:

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (125/343) * P1

So P2 / P1 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

Wait, but the question is how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is than planet #1. So P2 / P1 is 0.364, which is about 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1, so planet #1 has a longer period. So the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So it's 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter, so planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1. Thus, the ratio is 0.36.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~0.36

So the answer should be option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) method and orbital periods. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The shift in wavelength, $\Delta \lambda$, is proportional to the star's velocity, $v$, which is related to the orbital period, $P$, and the planet's mass, $M_p$, through the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{M_*^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Here, $K$ is the radial velocity semi-amplitude, $M_*$ is the star's mass, and $P$ is the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes, $K_1$ and $K_2$, is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, the Doppler shifts for Planet #1 and Planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Since $\Delta \lambda \propto K$, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is shorter than Planet #1's by a factor of 0.36.

From the given options:

A) ~0.36

Thus, the correct answer is:
