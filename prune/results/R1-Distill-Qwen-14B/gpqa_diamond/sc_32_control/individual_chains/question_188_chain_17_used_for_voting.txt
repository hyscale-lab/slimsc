Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is related to the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices of the plane. Oh right, the formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)(sum of (cos terms)) ) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

Oh wait, I think the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit different because all the angles are the same. The general formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral is a bit more complicated because the angles are not 90 degrees.

I recall that in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameter is a, and all the angles α, β, γ are equal. So the formula for d is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (h k + h l + k l) * (cos α) ) ), but wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Alternatively, maybe it's d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos α ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c and angles between them is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - (2hk cos βγ)/(a b) - (2hl cos αγ)/(a c) - (2kl cos αβ)/(b c)

But in the case of a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a (let's say), and all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ. Also, the angles between the vectors are the same. So I can simplify the formula.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, it's actually a special case where a = b = c, and the angles between each pair of axes are the same. So perhaps there's a specific formula for that.

I remember that in a rhombohedral lattice, the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Oh wait, wait, let me double-check. Because for a cubic system, θ is 90 degrees, so cos θ is zero, and it reduces to the cubic formula.

So in this problem, the angles α, β, γ are each 30 degrees. Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, are the angles between the vectors the same as the angles given? I think yes. So each angle in the rhombohedral system is 30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1. Plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( 1² + 1² + 1² + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) cos 30° )

Wait, let me compute that. The denominator would be sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cos(30°)).

Wait, wait, the formula I have is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe it's d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), considering that each pair of h, k, l terms is multiplied by 2 cos α.

So plugging in h, k, l all equal to 1:

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cos 30° )

Wait, because h² + k² + l² is 1+1+1=3. Then, hk + hl + kl is 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3. Multiply by 2, so 2*3=6. Then multiply by cos 30°, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )

Let me compute 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So 3 + 5.196 is approximately 8.196.

Then the square root of 8.196 is about sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

Wait, but wait, the value of a is given as the interatomic distance. Wait, wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, what is the interatomic distance? Hmm, that's a good point. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√2 for the diagonal, but maybe in a rhombohedral, the interatomic distance is 'a'?

Wait, the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might not be the same as 'a'. Because, for example, in a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, the interatomic distance is a√2/2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think clearly.

The interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice vectors. For a simple cubic structure, a would be the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral crystal, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as a? Or is it a different quantity?

Wait, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps 'a' is 10 Angstrom, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps 'a' is the edge length of the rhombohedral unit cell. So, if the interatomic distance is 'a', then a =10 Ang.

But let me proceed with that assumption.

So, a =10 Ang.

So, the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Compute 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

Sqrt(8.196) ≈2.864.

So d = 10 / 2.864 ≈3.494 Ang. Wait, but that's way smaller than the options provided. The options are all around 9 Angstrom. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Maybe the formula for d in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but perhaps the angles used are not the same as the angles of the crystal. Or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another way to compute interplanar distance is using the Miller indices and the structure factor, but I think I should be using the general formula for d-spacing.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors. In a rhombohedral system, all edges are of length a, and the angles between the edges are α, so each vector has the same magnitude and the same angles between them.

The formula for the interplanar distance is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but this is assuming that the three vectors are a, a, a, with angles α between each pair.

So with that in mind, let's compute again.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So, (h² +k² +l²) =3.

(hk + hl + kl)=3.

So, 2(hk + ... ) =6.

Then 6 * cos(30°) =6*(√3/2)=3√3≈5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d= a/(2.863) =10/2.863≈3.494 Ang. But the options are around 9 Ang, so this can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the angles given in the problem are the angles of the crystal, but in the formula, we have to use 180 - alpha instead. Or perhaps I mixed up the angles in the formula.

Wait, in crystallography, the angles in the unit cell are defined such that the angle between vectors a and b is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma. But in a rhombohedral system, all these angles are equal, so alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Wait, but in the formula, the cos terms might involve 180 - alpha because the angle between vectors is supplementary. Hmm, that's a possibility.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign of the cosine term. Because in the formula for interplanar distance, the angles that appear are actually the angles between the vectors, but in some cases, the angle used is 180 - alpha because of the way the vectors are defined.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses cos(theta) where theta is 180 - alpha, since in the unit cell, the angles between the vectors are 'theta' which is 180 - alpha. Let me think.

Wait, for example, in a cubic system, alpha is 90 degrees, and that's used as is. But in a rhombohedral system, if the angles given are 30 degrees, perhaps the angle between the vectors is 150 degrees (since cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2), which would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong because I should be using cos(180 - alpha) instead of cos(alpha).

Let me try that. So, cos(150 degrees) is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So the denominator would be sqrt(3 + 6*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

Compute 6*(-sqrt(3)/2)= -3 sqrt(3) ≈-5.196.

So 3 + (-5.196)= -2.196.

Wait, but that's negative, which can't be right because the square root of a negative number isn't real. So that can't be correct. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the formula uses the given alpha as is.

Wait, but I'm getting a result that's way too small compared to the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should be using the general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system, which is:

d = 1/ sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - (2hk cos βγ)/(a b) - (2hl cos αγ)/(a c) - (2kl cos αβ)/(b c) )

In rhombohedral, a = b = c = a, and all angles are α, so let's plug that in.

So,

d² = [ (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) ) + ( -2hk cos α )/(a²) - 2hl cos α/(a²) - 2kl cos α/(a²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should factor out 1/(a²):

d² = [ (h² +k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ) ] / (a² )

Which can be written as:

d² = [ (h² +k² + l²) - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) ) ] / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

Ah, so earlier I had the sign wrong. The correct formula subtracts 2 cos α (hk + ... ), not adds.

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2 cos(30) * (3) )

Because hk + hl + kl = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3, and multiplied by 2 cos(30) gives 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 sqrt(3).

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 3 sqrt(3) )

Wait, 3 - 3 sqrt(3) ≈3 -5.196≈-2.196.

Wait, that's negative. That can't be right because you can't take the square root of a negative number. So that suggests I made a mistake in the formula again.

Wait, perhaps I have to take the absolute value, or maybe I messed up the signs again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is adding the 2 cos α terms, not subtracting. Because if I subtract, and the angle is 30 degrees, cos is positive, so 3 - 6*(0.866) =3-5.196 = negative. Which is impossible. So perhaps I got the sign wrong.

Let me think again. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, that would make more sense. Because then, for a cubic system (alpha=90), cos 90=0, and it reduces to the usual cubic formula.

So let me recalculate using this formula.

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 2*(3) * (sqrt(3)/2) )

Because 2 cos α (hk + ...) is 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*3 = 3*sqrt(3)≈5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d=10 /2.864≈3.494 Ang.

Again, this gives a value around 3.5 Ang, which is way below the options given.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ), which is what I thought earlier. But the result is too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong 'a'? In the problem statement, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might not be the same as the lattice parameter 'a'.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', because atoms are at each corner. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps 'a' is the edge length, and the interatomic distance is something else.

Wait, for example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√2/2. So perhaps I'm confusing 'a' with the interatomic distance.

Wait, the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Ang. So 'a' is the lattice parameter. So 'a' could be different from the interatomic distance, depending on the structure.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a'. In a body-centered cubic (BCC), it's a√3/4. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' in rhombohedral. Let me proceed with that assumption.

But then why am I getting a d-spacing of about 3.5 Ang when the options are all around 9 Ang? That suggests I'm way off. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos α )

But perhaps the angles in the formula are 180 - α. So if the problem gives α=30°, then in the formula it's cos(150°), since the angle between the lattice vectors is 150 degrees.

Wait, that makes more sense because in a rhombohedral structure, the angle between the vectors is obtuse. Let me try that.

So, cos(150°) is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866) )

Compute 2*3*(-0.866)=6*(-0.866)= -5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative, which is impossible. So that can't be correct.

Hmm, maybe the formula uses 2*(hk + ... ) * cos(180 - alpha) instead. Wait, but that would be same as using cos(alpha).

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, according to Ashcroft and Mermin, the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. So if the lattice vectors have an angle θ, then this is the formula.

Ah, but in the problem, the angles given are α=β=γ=30°, so each angle between the lattice vectors is 30 degrees? Or is θ=30°? Or perhaps it's 180-30=150°, because in the unit cell, the angle between vectors a and b is 30°, but the angle in the formula may be 180-30.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between the vectors is 30°, making the formula use cos(30°).

Wait, let's try using cos(30°) in the formula.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3*sqrt(3)=5.196. So 3+5.196=8.196. Square root of that is about 2.864. So d=10/2.864≈3.49 Ang.

Again, same result as before, but it's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't using the same 'a' as the interatomic distance. Maybe 'a' is the edge length, and the interatomic distance is something else. For example, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√(something).

Wait, but the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So, perhaps 'a' is 10 Angstrom, but in the formula, we need to use a different value.

Alternatively, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', but perhaps I've misapplied the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula. Another approach is using the relation between interplanar distance and the reciprocal lattice.

The formula for d is given by 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ / a^2.

Wait, that's similar to what I had before. So,

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) / a^2.

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

But if theta is 30 degrees, then cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2.

So,

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)) )= a/(sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) )

As before, which gives 10 / 2.864≈3.49 Ang.

But the options are way bigger than that. So, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance 'd_inter' is a√(something). For example, in a simple cubic structure, 'a' is the interatomic distance, but in a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2.

So, in this problem, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√(something), and 'a' is different.

Wait, but the problem says that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So, perhaps 'a' is larger than 10. Let's think: If 'a' is the lattice parameter, and the interatomic distance is 10, then 'a' would be 10 multiplied by some factor, depending on the structure.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to compute the reciprocal of the denominator in the d formula and see if that gives me any of the options when I multiply by 'a' as 10.

Wait, the options are around 9 Ang. So, if d is about 9, then sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2))= a/(d)=10/9≈1.111.

Wait, 1.111 squared is about 1.234. So 3 + 3*sqrt(3)≈3+5.196=8.196. Then sqrt(8.196)=2.864. So 10/2.864≈3.494, which is not 9. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the correct formula for rhombohedral is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hkl) * (1 + 2 cos α ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try plugging in h=k=l=1.

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 1*(1+2*(sqrt(3)/2)) )= sqrt(3 - (1 + sqrt(3)) )= sqrt( (3-1) - sqrt(3) )= sqrt(2 - 1.732)= sqrt(0.268)≈0.517.

d=10/0.517≈19.35 Ang. No, that's larger than the options and not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )) )

But with alpha being 30 degrees, which gives cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*0.866)= sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d=10 /2.864≈3.49 Ang. But the options are all around 9 Ang. So perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a', but 'a' is the edge length, and the interatomic distance is a different value. But I'm not given 'a', I'm given the interatomic distance as 10.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So, with alpha=30 degrees.

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 -6*(0.866))= sqrt(3 -5.196)= sqrt(-2.196). Again, impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - alpha) )

Which would be cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator is sqrt(3 -6*(-sqrt(3)/2))= sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3))=sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864. So same as before.

So d=10/2.864≈3.494.

This is getting me nowhere because the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula, perhaps the correct formula for rhombohedral is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α/(a²)

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which brings me back to the same calculation as before.

So, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the wrong 'a'. Because if 'a' is the edge length, and the interatomic distance is 10, which could be related to the edge length.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is a√(something). For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, so if a =10, then that's fine. But in a different structure, 'a' might be larger.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure with a=10 Ang, the interatomic distance is given by a/sqrt(3), because the atoms might be placed at the corners of the rhombohedron.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at each corner, and the interatomic distance is a. In a rhombohedral structure, perhaps it's similar, so a would be the distance between neighboring atoms along the edges.

So, if the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10.

But then, why am I getting such a small d-spacing?

Hmm, maybe I should think of it as a face-centered rhombohedral structure, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hkl)(cos α + cos beta + cos gamma) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, alpha =beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So, for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 - (1)(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) )

Which is sqrt(3 - (3*sqrt(3)/2)).

Calculate 3*sqrt(3)/2 ≈2.598.

So, 3 -2.598 ≈0.402.

sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

So d=10 /0.634≈15.77 Ang. Not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell volume and the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = (a√(1 - cos^2 α)) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But since the result is giving me 3.49, which is much smaller than the options, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of 'a' or 'interatomic distance'.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, 'interatomic distance' refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the diagonal, not along the edges.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the diagonal of the rhombohedral face. For example, if the face is a rhombus with side 'a' and angle 30 degrees, then the diagonal would be sqrt( a² + a² - 2a² cos 30 ) = sqrt(2a² (1 - cos30 )).

So interatomic distance would be sqrt(2a² (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )) = a * sqrt(2*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )).

So if the interatomic distance is 10, then:

10 = a * sqrt(2*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )).

We can compute sqrt(2*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )):

1 - sqrt(3)/2 ≈1-0.866/2=1-0.433=0.567.

2*0.567=1.134.

sqrt(1.134)=approx 1.065.

So a=10 /1.065≈9.39 Ang.

Now, using this 'a' in the formula for d:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=9.39 / sqrt(8.196)=9.39/2.864≈3.278. Still much smaller than the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the one used for hexagonal crystals, but applied to rhombohedral. Or maybe I'm confusing the Bravais lattice parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) ), but that can't be right because if alpha is 60 degrees, then cos 60=0.5, and so on. But I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute each step accurately.

Given:

h = k = l = 1.

alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees.

a is the lattice parameter. Interatomic distance is 10 Ang.

Formula for d:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos alpha )

Plugging in:

h² +k² +l² =3.

hk + hl + kl=3.

So,

d= a / sqrt( 3 + 2*3 * cos(30) )

= a / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

So, if a is 10 Ang, d=10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)) ≈ 10 /2.864 ≈3.494.

But options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane, which might be the same as the reciprocal of the Miller indices multiplied by something else.

Wait, or perhaps the formula is:

d = 1/ sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/a)^2 + (l/a)^2 + 2*(h k (cos beta gamma)/(a²)) + 2*(h l (cos alpha gamma)/(a²)) + 2*(k l (cos alpha beta)/(a²)) )

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But that leads to:

sqrt(3 -6*0.866)= sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196) → imaginary. So that can't be.

Another thought: Maybe the formula uses (180 - alpha) for the angles. So cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So,

d= a / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-sqrt(3)/2) )= a / sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

3 -3*sqrt(3)≈3-5.196≈-2.196.

Which is negative. So can't compute.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula, and the correct formula is different.

Wait, another approach: maybe the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral structure is given by a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos alpha), but I'm not certain.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*cos(30)).

cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

3 +6*0.866 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

d=10/2.864≈3.494.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this value. So either I'm applying the formula wrong or the options are expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the reciprocal of 'a' in some way. Or perhaps the interatomic distance is given as 10, and 'a' is different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√(something). Let me think: for a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance along the edges is a, so a=10. But along the face diagonal, it's a√(2) →10*1.414=14.14.

Wait, but I don't have the right formula here.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a*sqrt(3), so a=10/sqrt(3)=5.773 Ang.

Then,

d=5.773 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Which would be 5.773 /2.864≈2.016. Still not matching options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I can't seem to get an answer matching the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the reciprocal lattice vector approach.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h^* = (1/a) [1, 1, 1] + (cos α/(a sin alpha)) [1,1,1]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be determined using the metric tensor.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But then with a=10, it's 3.494, which doesn't fit. So perhaps 'a' is not 10. But the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Ang.

Wait, maybe the lattice parameter 'a' is not the same as the interatomic distance. Let me think of a simple case: in a face-centered cubic (FCC), the interatomic distance is a√2/2. So if the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10/(√2/2)=10*2/√2=20/1.414≈14.142 Ang.

If I use this 'a' in the formula:

d=14.142 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)) =14.142/2.864≈4.939 Ang. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is using the sum of the reciprocals squared.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d² = (1/a²) [ h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α ]

But that's what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

d² = (1/a²)[ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ]

Which gives same as before.

So, unless the problem is using a different definition for 'a', I can't reconcile the result with the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different angle convention, such as 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try that.

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.5))=10/sqrt(3+3)=10/sqrt(6)=≈4.082 Ang. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the angles in the problem are 120 degrees. Because sometimes in rhombohedral systems, the angles are considered as 60 or 120.

Wait, let's try cos(60)=0.5.

d=10/sqrt(3 +6*0.5)=10/sqrt(3+3)=10/sqrt(6)=approx4.082.

No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 60 degrees. So cos(60)=0.5.

Same as above.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should try all the options to see which one fits the formula. Let's see:

Option A) 9.08 Ang.

Compute denominator: 10/d =10/9.08≈1.101.

So 1.101^2=1.212.

So,

3 +3*sqrt(3)=3+5.196=8.196.

So 10/d =sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

Wait, 10/d =2.864 → d=10/2.864≈3.494, which isn't 9.08.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is 10/(9.08)=1.101, so 1.101^2=1.212.

So,

h² +k² +l² + 2*(hk + hl +kl)*cos alpha = (d formula denominator)^2.

So,

3 +6* cos alpha = (10/d)^2.

So,

3 +6 cos alpha = (10/d)^2.

If d is option A,9.08, then (10/9.08)^2≈(1.101)^2≈1.212.

So,

3 +6 cos alpha =1.212 →6 cos alpha= -1.788 → cos alpha= -0.298. Alpha would be about 107 degrees. But the problem states alpha=30.

That doesn't fit.

Similarly, for option B)8.95 Ang.

(10/8.95)^2≈(1.117)^2≈1.248.

So,

3 +6 cos alpha=1.248 →6 cos alpha= -1.752 → cos alpha≈-0.292. Again, alpha around 107 degrees.

No match.

Option C)9.54 Ang.

(10/9.54)^2≈(1.048)^2≈1.098.

So,

3 +6 cos alpha=1.098 →6 cos alpha= -1.902 →cos alpha≈-0.317. Alpha≈108.5 degrees. Still not 30.

Option D)10.05 Ang.

(10/10.05)^2≈(0.995)^2≈0.990.

So,

3 +6 cos alpha=0.990 →6 cos alpha= -2.01 →cos alpha≈-0.335. Alpha≈110 degrees.

None of the options fit when alpha is 30.

Wait, but this suggests that the correct d-spacing isn't in the options, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) * (1 + 2 cos alpha) )

Let me try that.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +3*(1 +2*(sqrt(3)/2) ) )

Compute inside the square root:

3 +3*(1 + sqrt(3)) =3 +3 +3*sqrt(3)=6 +5.196=11.196.

sqrt(11.196)=3.346.

d=10/3.346≈2.988 Ang. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But with a=10.

So again, same as before, d=3.494.

Wait, perhaps the answer options are using a different formula, perhaps the one for a cubic system.

In cubic system, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²).

So for (111), d= a / sqrt(3).

If a=10, d=10/1.732≈5.77 Ang.

But that's also not matching any options.

Hmm.

An alternative approach: maybe the problem is treating the rhombohedral as a hexagonal system, which has a different formula.

Wait, no, hexagonal is different.

Wait, given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C)9.54 Ang.

Wait, how?

If I take the reciprocal of 9.54, it's approximately 0.1048.

So,

(10/9.54)^2≈(1.048)^2≈1.098.

So,

3 +6* cos alpha=1.098 →6 cos alpha= -1.902 →cos alpha≈-0.317.

Which would imply alpha≈108 degrees. But the problem states alpha=30.

So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the formula used is d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) → thus, for (111), d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just using the cubic formula, assuming the angles are 90 degrees, even though they're 30.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the angles are 60 degrees.

Let me compute that.

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.5))=10/sqrt(6)=4.08 Ang.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, what if I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is using the sum (h +k +l)^2 instead of h² +k² + l² ?

So,

d = a / sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

For (111), h +k +l=3.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(9 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 )).

Compute inside the square root:

9 +6*(0.866)=9+5.196=14.196.

sqrt(14.196)=3.769.

d=10/3.769≈2.655 Ang. No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But again, same result.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct formula gives d≈3.49 Ang, which isn't among the options. But since the options are way larger, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula or the approach.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) plane's direction, not along the edges. So, the interatomic distance is d, which is what we're looking for.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the interatomic distance refers to the distance between neighboring atoms, which would be along the lattice vectors.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is using a different expression involving the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos² α - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma ).

But with alpha=beta=gamma=30, this simplifies to:

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute:

(sqrt(3)/2)^2= 3/4.

3*(3/4)=9/4=2.25.

(sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3 sqrt(3))/8≈0.6495.

2*0.6495=1.299.

So,

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -2.25 +1.299 )= a^3*sqrt( (1 +1.299) -2.25 )

= a^3*sqrt(2.299 -2.25)=a^3*sqrt(0.049)=a^3*(0.221).

But I'm not sure how this helps me find the interplanar distance.

Hmm. I'm out of ideas. I think the correct answer based on the formula I've been using is approximately 3.494 Ang, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option C)9.54 Ang. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula involves the cube of the denominator. Let's see:

If d=10/sqrt(3 +6*0.866)=10/2.864≈3.494, then 1/d≈0.286.

Wait, if I take the reciprocal of 0.286, I get about 3.5, which is not helpful.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But that would give sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So no.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer according to the formula is approximately 3.49 Ang, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, but since none are close, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Ang.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate using a different approach. For example, using the plane equation and the reciprocal lattice.

The plane (111) has h=1, k=1, l=1.

The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2(hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2(hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(b c) )

In a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30°.

So,

d = 1 / sqrt( (1/a)^2 *3 - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(a^2) *3 )

= 1 / sqrt( 3/a² - 6 cos30/(a²) )

= a / sqrt(3 -6 cos30 )

= a / sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, 3*sqrt(3)=5.196, so 3-5.196=-2.196. Again, negative. So can't compute.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, the formula for the plane is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2hl cos beta/(a c) - 2kl cos alpha/(b c) )

In rhombohedral, a=b=c=a, and angles are all 30°.

So,

= 1 / sqrt( (1/a²)(1+1+1) - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(a²) *3 )

= 1 / sqrt( 3/a² - 6 cos30/(a²) )

= a / sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

= a / sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Which is the same as before, leading to a negative value. So no solution.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the angles. Maybe it's 180-30=150°, so cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So,

d = a/sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=a/sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which brings us back to a=10, d=3.494 Ang.

No match.

I'm stuck, so I'll have to conclude that the correct answer based on the formula is about 3.49 Ang, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended formula was different, leading to option C)9.54 Ang.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the sum (h +k +l) squared. So,

d= a / sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

For (111):

h+k+l=3.

So,

d=10/sqrt(9 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=10/sqrt(9 +3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3*sqrt(3)=5.196.

So, 9+5.196=14.196.

sqrt(14.196)=3.769.

d=10/3.769≈2.655 Ang. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C)9.54 Ang. But I'm not sure how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator in the formula.

Wait, if d=9.54 Ang, then 1/d ≈0.1048.

So,

a / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=9.54.

So,

10 / sqrt(8.196)=9.54.

But 10/2.864≈3.494, not 9.54.

So, this approach doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using a different sign.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which would be,

d=10/sqrt(3 -6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(3 -5.196)= sqrt(negative), which is invalid.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Ang, but I'm not sure how to arrive there.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Å and angles \(\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ\). The interplanar distance \( d \) is determined using the formula for rhombohedral systems:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha}}
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:
1. **Given Parameters**:
   - Interatomic distance = 10 Å.
   - Miller indices for the (111) plane: \( h = k = l = 1 \).
   - Angles \(\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ\), so \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866\).

2. **Substitute into the Formula**:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \).
   - \( hk + hl + kl = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 3 \).
   - Denominator becomes:
     \[
     \sqrt{3 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cos 30^\circ} = \sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.864
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     d = \frac{10}{2.864} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}.
     \]

3. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated \( d \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all significantly larger (around 9 Å). This suggests either:
     - The formula used might be incorrect or incomplete.
     - The interatomic distance provided (10 Å) might not correspond directly to the lattice parameter \( a \), and a different relationship might exist between \( a \) and the interatomic distance.

4. **Exploration of Other Possibilities**:
   - Several alternative approaches were considered, including:
     - Adjusting the formula to account for supplementary angles (\( 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ \)), but this led to negative values under the square root, which are invalid.
     - Using different definitions of \( a \) (e.g., \( a \) being the edge length or diagonal of the rhombohedron), but these also did not yield results matching the options.
     - Testing the options directly by reversing the formula to check consistency with the given angles and interatomic distance, but none of the options aligned with the expected values.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite extensive analysis, the calculated \( d \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å} \) does not match the provided options. Given the mismatch, it is possible that the problem assumes a different formula or interpretation of the interatomic distance. Based on the options, the closest plausible answer appears to be **C) 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning to arrive at this value remains unclear.

ANSWER: C
