Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to figure out their energy difference so that we can clearly distinguish between the two levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes people use ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, depending on the exact formulation. I think it's better to check the precise formula.

So the uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ divided by 2. Or maybe it's ħ, I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me think—Heisenberg's original principle was ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. But sometimes, people include a factor of 2 or pi, so perhaps it's actually ΔE Δt >= ħ/2 or something like that. Well, for the purposes of this problem, maybe the exact constant isn't crucial, but the relationship between ΔE and Δt.

The problem is about the lifetimes of the states, which relate to the uncertainty in time. The lifetime of a state is the time for which the state exists before decaying, so the uncertainty in time Δt is related to the lifetime τ. I think Δt is approximately the same as τ for the purpose of estimating the uncertainty. So, for each state, we can calculate the energy uncertainty due to their lifetimes.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states, not the uncertainty in each. Hmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait—no, the problem isn't directly about the uncertainty in each state's energy, but about the minimum energy difference needed so that the two states can be distinguished. So maybe the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty given by the product of ħ and the inverse of the sum or something... Hmm, perhaps I should think about the resolving power in terms of spectroscopy.

In spectroscopy, the energy resolution depends on the uncertainty in the measured energy. To distinguish two energy levels, their separation must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. So the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy ΔE determined by the uncertainty principle.

Wait, but each state has a different lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

But how does this relate to the difference between E1 and E2? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should calculate the energy uncertainty for each state and then see what the minimum ΔE between E1 and E2 needs to be.

So, let's do that. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 seconds and τ2 = 1e-8 seconds. Assuming ħ is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

So, for E1: ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J. To convert that into eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, we divide by that. So 1.055e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, that's like 6.58e-7 eV. Hmm, that seems small.

For E2: ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. Converting to eV, that's 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait a second, so ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV. So the energy resolution is determined by the smaller of the two, perhaps? Or maybe the sum?

Wait, another approach. The energy difference between E1 and E2 must be such that it's significantly larger than the uncertainties from both states. So ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Or perhaps the maximum of the two, since E2 has a longer lifetime, leading to a smaller uncertainty.

Wait, no, the uncertainty principle works on the individual states. So to resolve two states, their energies must be separated by more than the sum of the uncertainties of each, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement, which is related to the time resolution of the experiment.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it this way: the energy resolution of a measurement is determined by the uncertainty in energy. So if we have a measurement apparatus that can measure energy with a precision ΔE, then to distinguish two levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than ΔE.

So what is the uncertainty in the energy measurement in this case? It would be determined by the time over which the measurement is made. Wait, the measurement's Δt would be the time the system is observed. But in this problem, each state has a different lifetime, which I think relates to the uncertainty in time for each state.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty for each state is given by ħ divided by their lifetime. So the energy resolution needed to distinguish E1 and E2 is such that their difference is larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps the minimum of the two.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to find the energy uncertainty due to each state's lifetime and sum them. So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let me compute that.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. Sum is 7.238e-7 eV. So the minimum energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than 7.238e-7 eV. Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. Option A is 1e-9, which is way smaller. Hmm, wait but the options don't have anything around 1e-7, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about energy-time uncertainty. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2.

In this case, the uncertainties in time are the lifetimes of the states. So for each state, Δt is about τ. So for each state, ΔE_i ≈ ħ/(2 τ_i).

Wait, but when you have two states, E1 and E2, what is the combined uncertainty? Or perhaps when you have transitions between the states, the uncertainty in the energy measurement would be related to the shorter of the two lifetimes, because the transition time is perhaps determined by the difference in lifetimes.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish the two states. So the energy difference must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, let's compute ΔE for each state:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) → (1.05e-34 J·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = 5.25e-26 J → converting to eV: 5.25e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J → 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 = ~3.28e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than this ΔE1, because if it's smaller, the two energies would be within each other's uncertainty, making them indistinguishable.

Looking at the options, the energy difference must be greater than 3.28e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 3e-7 → too small.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → much larger, which is okay.

D) 1e-8 → 1e-8 is smaller than 3e-7 → too small.

So the only option that is larger than 3.28e-7 eV is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another thought: perhaps when considering the energy difference between E1 and E2, the relevant uncertainty is the uncertainty in the energy difference. Because if the system can transition between E1 and E2, the uncertainty in the energy difference would depend on the time over which the system can be in a superposition of the two states.

Hmm, but if the lifetimes are τ1 and τ2, which are the times each state exists before decaying, perhaps the time Δt for the energy transition is the minimum of τ1 and τ2? Or the longer of the two? Or the average?

Alternatively, the energy difference's uncertainty might be determined by the maximum of the two lifetimes, or perhaps by the sum. I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the time is the time during which the system is in a superposition, which would be the minimum of the lifetimes? Or something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The energy resolution is determined by the time over which you can make the measurement. If the state has a short lifetime, the energy becomes uncertain because of the short time you can observe it.

But in this problem, we're dealing with two separate states. So when you measure the energy, you can only resolve them if their energy separation is greater than the uncertainty in the measurement. The uncertainty in the measurement would be determined by the minimum of the two lifetimes, perhaps.

Wait, the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. So the shorter lifetime is 1e-9 s. The uncertainty in energy for that state is higher because ΔE = ħ/ τ. So the measurement's energy uncertainty would be dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime, which is τ1 = 1e-9 s.

So the energy uncertainty ΔE is about 1e-25 J → 6.5e-7 eV as calculated earlier.

So the energy difference must be greater than this ΔE to be distinguishable. So the smallest energy difference that's clearly resolvable is just above ΔE, but let's look at the options. The options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → no, too small.

B) 1e-11 → no.

C) 1e-4 → yes, that's 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 6.5e-7 eV. So that would be resolvable.

D) 1e-8 → 1e-8 is larger than 6.5e-7? No, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is smaller than 6.5e-7. So D is too small.

So the only option that's larger than the required ΔE is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me compute the precise value.

Given ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.60217663e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 / 1.60217663e-19 ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.60217663) * 1e-6 ≈ approx 0.658 * 1e-6 → 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J → 1.0545718e-26 / 1.60217663e-19 = approx 6.58e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV.

The energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable. So looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than this.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_i \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_i}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required
To distinguish between the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 \) or \( \Delta E_2 \). Here, \( \Delta E_1 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is the larger uncertainty.

Thus, the energy difference must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small to resolve the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition for distinguishability.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is **Option C**.
