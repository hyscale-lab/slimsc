Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. So the idea is that the star moves a little bit back and forth because the planet's orbiting it.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. They detected these planets using RV. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. And the question is about how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how the RV method works, but I think the key here is the Doppler shift. The shift in wavelength depends on the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, but I might be mixing it up.

Wait, more accurately, the radial velocity (v) of the star can be found using the Doppler formula: v = (delta lambda / lambda) * c, but since delta lambda is given in milliangstroms, and I'm comparing two measurements, maybe I can relate the velocities directly.

So, the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7. Since the same spectral line is used, the lambda is the same for both. So the velocity ratio would be v1/v2 = 5/7. Wait no, because if the shift is larger, the velocity is higher. So v2 = (7/5) * v1.

Wait wait, let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity. The semi-amplitude (K) of the velocity is proportional to the planet's mass and the star's velocity. But wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some factors. But wait, I'm not too sure about the exact formula, maybe I should think about what affects the velocity semi-amplitude.

Alternatively, I remember that for a given planet mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period if the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, which is the case here since the planets are Neptune-like and stars are like Sun. Wait, no, I think the semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and semi-major axis.

Wait, the formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2 * c) )^(something?), wait maybe not. Alternatively, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude is given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) ) ) / (c), but I'm not entirely confident about the exact form.

Wait, another approach: since the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the orbital period to the 1/3 power. Because the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G M_star ) a³. So a = [ (G M_star P²)/(4π²) ]^(1/3). 

The velocity of the star in the RV method is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (a / P), since the star's velocity is v = (2π a / P) * (M_p/(M_star + M_p)). Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to approximately (2π a) / (P M_star) * M_p. So v ≈ (2π a) / (P M_star) * M_p.

But a is proportional to (P² M_star)^(1/3). So substituting a into v: v ≈ (2π) * [ (P² M_star)^(1/3) ) ] / ( P M_star ) ) * M_p.

Simplify that: [ (P²)^(1/3) ) ] is P^(2/3), and [ M_star^(1/3) ] over M_star is M_star^(-2/3). So v ≈ (2π) * (P^(2/3) / M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P) ) * M_p.

Wait, because (P²)^(1/3) is P^(2/3), and 1/P is P^(-1), so overall P^(2/3 -1) = P^(-1/3). So v ≈ (2π) * (M_p) * (P^(-1/3)) ) * ( M_star^(-2/3) ) ) * something? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps another way to think: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( (2π / P )^(1/3) ) ). So K ≈ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) * something else. So if K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), and K2 is proportional to 1/P2^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)). So K1 = C * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = C * (1/P2^(1/3)), where C is a proportionality constant that includes other factors, like M_p and M_star, but since both planets have similar masses and stars have the same mass, the C should be the same for both.

So K1 / K2 = ( (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, the ratio is K1 = 5, K2=7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So  (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) = 5/7.

Wait, no. Because K is the velocity shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 = 5/7. And since K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So to find (P2/P1), we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait wait, no. Wait, if K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the question is asking, the ratio P2/P1.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, that's shorter, so it's not longer. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1. If P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, no, that's not correct. No, if P2 is 0.36 of P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-express this. Because K is proportional to (1/P^1/3). So higher K implies shorter orbital period. Because if K increases, the planet is making the star move more, which would mean the star is moving faster. But a higher K could be due to a more massive planet or a shorter period. Wait, but in this problem, the planet masses are similar, so the higher K (7 vs 5) must be because of the period.

If K is higher, then planet has a shorter period. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K means smaller P.

So K2 is larger than K1, so P2 is smaller than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since it's shorter, the answer would be less than 1. So the options are A) ~0.36, D) ~0.85, etc.

But let's compute the exact ratio. So from before:

K1 = 5, K2 =7.

K1 / K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343.

Let me compute that: 125 ÷ 343.

Well, 343 is 7^3 (7*7=49, 49*7=343). So 125/343 = (5^3)/(7^3) )= (5/7)^3.

Calculating 125 ÷ 343:

343 is about 3.43e2, 125 ÷ 343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, but 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter.

But the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times longer? No, it's the other way around. For example, if P1 is 10 years and P2 is 3.6 years, then P2 is 3.6/10 = 0.36 times P1. So P2 is 0.36 times the period of P1, meaning it's shorter. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1, so it's shorter. So the answer would be that P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1, which is option A, but the question is phrased as "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's 0.36 times as long, which is shorter. So the question is, the period of #2 is longer than #1 by a factor of 0.36. But that would mean it's shorter. Wait, no. No, because if you say "X is longer than Y by a factor of k", then X = k * Y. If k is less than 1, X is shorter than Y. But the question is asking for how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's a bit ambiguous, but in this case, P2 is shorter than P1, so the ratio is less than 1, but the question is looking for the multiple, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1, which is incorrect because it's shorter. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio reversed. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so K1 is smaller than K2, meaning P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, wait, K = V (velocity) is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3)). So if K is bigger, then either P is smaller, or M_p is bigger, or M_star is smaller. Since M_p is similar and M_star is same, higher K must mean shorter P. So K2 > K1 implies P2 < P1.

So the ratio (P2 / P1) is ( (K1 / K2) )^3. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2 than planet #1? So the answer is 0.36 times longer, which would mean it's shorter. So the correct ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Because the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if I have P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's actually shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So it's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. But the question is phrased as "how many times longer," which would imply a multiplier greater than 1. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So P1 = (1/K1)^3 * C, and P2 = (1/K2)^3 * C. So the ratio P2/P1 is ( (1/K2) / (1/K1) )^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer is 0.36 times as long. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So it's shorter. So if the question is asking how many times longer is #2 than #1, the answer is that it's 0.36 times longer, which is A.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, and the semi-amplitude of this shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \). Mathematically, \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), which implies \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

For planet #1, the spectral line shift corresponds to \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and for planet #2, \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the proportionality constant is the same for both. The ratio of the orbital periods can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is \( \sim 0.36 \), which corresponds to option A.
