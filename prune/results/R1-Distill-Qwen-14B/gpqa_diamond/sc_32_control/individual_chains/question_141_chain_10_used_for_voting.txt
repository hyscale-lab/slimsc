Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit new to this, but I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, maybe like a Birch reduction or something else.

Wait, wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, the 'd' probably stands for deuterium, right? So it's bromobenzene with a deuterium at the 2-position. Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene? Yeah, that makes sense. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. I think NaNH2 is a strong base, used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Or wait, maybe it's used for elimination to form alkenes. Alternatively, in some cases, it's used in the Birch reduction, which is for aromatic rings—like adding electrons, but Birch usually uses metals like Na or others in ammonia.

Wait, but 1-bromobenzene-2-d—so the bromine is in position 1, and the deuterium is in position 2. When you treat bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2, I think it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, bromobenzene doesn't have any adjacent H's except maybe on the ring. Wait, wait, wait. Bromobenzene is benzene with a Br substituent. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br at one position. But in this case, the Br is at position 1, and position 2 has a deuterium.

But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So when you have Br at position 1, the adjacent positions are 2, 6. So the deuterium is at position 2. So, the molecule is bromide at 1, deuterium at 2.

Deprotonation, maybe? But wait, if the base is NaNH2, which is a strong base, maybe it abstracts a proton from the ring. But wait, in benzene, the ring protons are pretty acidic, but not as much as in some other cases. But in the presence of a deuterium, perhaps that affects things.

Wait, but wait, when you have a Br on the benzene ring, it's an electron-withdrawing group, which would deactivate the ring and make the ring protons more acidic in certain positions. Because the Br is meta-directing, but for acidity, the para position is more acidic than the ortho position because of the electron-withdrawing effect.

Wait, but the deuterium is in the ortho position to Br. So the ring has a Br at 1, and a D at 2. So the other positions are 3,4,5,6.

So when the base (NaNH2) is added, it abstracts a proton. Which positions are available? The ring has H's at positions 3,4,5,6, but D at 2 and Br at 1. So the base may abstract a proton from positions adjacent to the Br, but wait, ortho and para positions.

Wait, but the H's ortho to Br (positions 2 and 6) might be more acidic because Br is EWG. But position 2 is D, so the H's at 6 would be ortho to Br. Wait, but in the molecule, position 2 is D, so the H at position 6 is adjacent to Br?

Wait, no. Let's number the benzene ring. Let me draw it out mentally. Let's say the Br is at position 1. Then, moving around the ring, position 2 is next to Br, and that's where the D is. So the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. So position 2 is D, position 6 is H. So the H at position 6 is ortho to Br, making it more acidic. So the base could abstract the H at position 6.

When the base abstracts a proton at position 6, that would lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6, but wait, no. Wait, when a base abstracts a proton from a benzene ring, it forms a cyclohexadienide anion. So, the ring becomes aromatic with a negative charge.

So, the initial structure is 1-bromo-2-d-benzene. After deprotonation at position 6, the ring would have a negative charge, and the Br is at position 1, D at 2, and the negative charge at position 6.

But then, what happens next? Maybe elimination? Oh wait, wait, another possibility: when Br is on the ring adjacent to a deprotonated position, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

Wait, but Br is at position 1, the H is abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent to Br. So, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So abstracting H from position 6 would lead to an adjacent Br and a deprotonated position. So perhaps an elimination reaction occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but wait. If the Br is at position 1 and the H is taken from position 6, which is next to position 1 via the benzene ring. So the atoms that are adjacent are positions 1 and 2 (they're next to each other), but 6 is across from 1? No, in benzene, each carbon is connected to the next, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3, etc., up to 6 and 1.

Wait, no. Let me correct. In benzene, each carbon is connected to the next, so position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So position 6 is adjacent to position 1, yes. So if the H is abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1, then elimination could occur between C1 and C6, removing H and Br, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait, the H is abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br). So with the base taking H from position 6, the Br at 1 and the position 6 would be adjacent. So perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring forms a double bond between 1 and 6, or between 6 and 1. Wait, but wait, benzene is a ring so the positions are in a circle.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mechanism. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1, then that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6. Then, perhaps the Br could leave as Br-.

Wait, but Br is a good leaving group. So, after deprotonation, the ring is negatively charged at position 6, and Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 (D) and 6 (now deprotonated). So if the Br leaves, perhaps as Br- , then there's a double bond formed between C1 and C6.

Wait, but in benzene, each C is connected to two other Cs. So if the Br leaves, and the adjacent C (position 6) has a negative charge, then perhaps a double bond forms between C1 and C6, making the ring have a double bond there.

Wait, but when a double bond forms, the ring would become a cyclohexadiene, but that's not possible because benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of aromatic substitution. Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility: the deprotonation leads to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then attack another molecule or lose the Br.

Wait, maybe the base induces an elimination of HBr, forming a double bond. So, if the H is abstracted from position 6, adjacent to the Br at position 1, then H and Br are eliminated, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, in benzene, that would correspond to forming a new double bond. But benzene already has alternating double bonds, so perhaps this is a case where a ring contraction or expansion occurs, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a substituent that leads to a new structure. Wait, let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so Br at position 1, D at 2.

When NaNH2 is added, it's a strong base. So it might abstract a proton from the ring. Where are those protons? Let's see, the ring has D at 2, so H at positions 3,4,5,6.

Wait, but the H in position 6 is adjacent to Br at 1, so it's more acidic. So the base would abstract H from position 6, making a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6 and Br at position 1.

Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br- , because it's a good leaving group, and that would form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, the ring is a six-membered ring, so if positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, eliminating H and Br would form a double bond between C1 and C6, which would change the structure.

Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds. So if a new double bond is formed, perhaps the ring becomes a substituted cyclohexene. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a Fittig reaction? No, that's for coupling aryl halides with metals, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the position where Br was. So after elimination, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, perhaps.

Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 is D, so that's occupied. So eliminating Br from C1 and H from C6 would form a double bond between C6 and C1, but then position 2 is D, so the structure would have a double bond between C6 and C1, and Br would leave, forming a new ring structure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the possible products. Let's see, if elimination occurs, how many isomers could form?

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a substitution reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the benzide anion. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-d treated with a strong base like NaNH2 would form a benzide (aromatic ring with negative charge), but that's more typical when you have two substituents that can stabilize the negative charge.

Wait, but in this case, we have Br and D. So maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzide anion, but then Br leaves, forming a ring with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I think that usually requires activating groups. Br is deactivating, so that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of EAS, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, forming styrene or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible products. If elimination occurs, removing H and Br from adjacent positions, a double bond would form. But how many possible products can form?

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d-benzene. So Br is at position 1, D at 2. When the base abstracts a proton, which position is it abstracting? Let's look for the most acidic protons.

The Br is at position 1. The protons adjacent to Br (positions 2 and 6) would be more acidic because of the EWG effect. But position 2 is D, so the H at position 6 is the next most acidic.

So the base abstracts H from position 6, forming a benzene anion with negative charge at C6 and Br at C1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, and the D at C2.

Wait, but benzene already has three double bonds in a conjugated system. How would adding another double bond affect that? Maybe the ring would adjust the double bonds to accommodate, leading to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene derivative, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the resulting structure is a diene, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, but perhaps the major product would be a benzene ring with a substituent where the Br was removed, but that's not possible. Or perhaps the Br leaves, and a hydrogen is abstracted, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Hmm, I'm not too confident about that.

Wait, another possibility: since the ring is aromatic, maybe the reaction forms a new aromatic ring. Wait, but if you eliminate HBr, you lose two atoms and form a double bond, possibly creating a new substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a vinyl group or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought. Maybe the base abstracts a proton from another position, leading to different products.

Wait, so the D is at position 2. So the H's available are at positions 3,4,5,6. Which of these are ortho, meta, para to the Br?

The Br is at position 1. So the positions are as follows:

Position 2: D (ortho to Br)
Position 3: meta to Br
Position 4: para to Br
Position 5: meta to Br
Position 6: ortho to Br

So the H's at positions 6 and 2 are ortho to Br. But position 2 has D, so the H at 6 is ortho. The H's at positions 3 and 5 are meta, and position 4 is para.

In terms of acidity, the para position is more acidic than meta, which is more acidic than ortho. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for nitro groups, which are strong EWGs, the para position is more acidic than meta or ortho. But for Br, which is a weaker EWG, maybe the ortho is more acidic than para.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The acidity of the protons on the benzene ring depends on the substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity of the protons in the ortho and para positions because they stabilize the negative charge after deprotonation.

So Br is an EWG. So the H's in the ortho and para positions to Br are more acidic than the meta positions.

In this case, the H at position 6 is ortho to Br, so it's more acidic. The para position is position 4, so H at position 4 is also more acidic. The H at position 3 and 5 are meta, so less acidic.

Wait, so the base NaNH2 is a strong enough base to abstract a proton. It would prefer to abstract the most acidic proton. So the most acidic H's are at position 6 (ortho) and position 4 (para). So which is more acidic?

Wait, I think that for substituents like nitro groups, the para position is more acidic than the ortho because the ring can better stabilize the negative charge in the para position. But for Br, which is less electronegative, perhaps the ortho is more acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps the para is more acidic because of better resonance stabilization. Hmm.

Wait, in any case, the base could abstract either the H from position 6 (ortho) or position 4 (para). So if both positions are possible, that would lead to different products.

Wait, but the starting material has a D at position 2. So when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, it's adjacent to Br, which is at position 1. Then elimination could happen, removing Br and H, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, the ring is six-membered, so positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, leading to a structure where the ring has a double bond between C1 and C6, and the D is at position 2.

But that would make the structure have a double bond between 1 and 6, which would be a non-conjugated position in the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring with a substituent.

Wait, let me think about the possible products.

If the H is abstracted from position 6, then the adjacent Br could leave, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6. The D is at position 2, so the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and D at 2.

Alternatively, if the H is abstracted from position 4 (para to Br), then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C4. But wait, that wouldn't be adjacent. Wait, no, elimination occurs between adjacent C's.

Wait, elimination requires that the H and the leaving group (Br) are on adjacent carbons. So if the H is at position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1, elimination can happen. But if the H is taken from position 4, which is para to Br, then it's not adjacent, so elimination isn't possible.

Wait, that's an important point. So the base can abstract a proton that's either ortho or para to the Br. But for elimination (E2 mechanism), the H and Br must be antiperiplanar and on adjacent carbons. So if the H is abstracted from a position not adjacent to Br, elimination can't occur.

So in this case, the H at position 6 is adjacent to Br, so elimination is possible. The H at position 4 is para to Br, so it's not adjacent, so elimination wouldn't be possible. So the base would abstract the H at position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.

So the product would be benzene with a double bond between C1 and C6, and deuterium at C2. So the structure would be 1,6-dideutero-benzenediazonium chloride? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the product would be a benzene ring where C1 and C6 are double-bonded, and the D is at C2.

Wait, but wait, the double bond between C1 and C6 would change the structure. So the product would be a cyclohexene derivative, maybe 1,2-dideutero-1,2-diphenylethylene or something. Hmm, not sure about the nomenclature.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring where the Br is replaced by a double bond. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, position 2 has D, so that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with the double bond between C1 and C6, making it 1,6-dideutero-1,2-diphenylethylene. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a 1-dideutero-1,3-butadienyl benzene or something else. I'm not entirely certain about the structure.

But regardless of the exact structure, the main point is that the reaction could produce one product if only ortho H is abstracted and elimination occurs. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from a different position, but that's not adjacent to Br, elimination wouldn't happen, but substitution could.

Wait, but substitution reactions in aromatic rings usually require activating groups. Br is deactivating, so nucleophilic substitution is unlikely. So the main pathway is elimination.

Wait, but if elimination happens, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6, that's one product. Are there any other possible products?

Wait, another possibility: after deprotonation at position 6, the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But the D is at C2, so the structure would have D at C2 and a double bond between C1 and C6. That's one product.

Alternatively, could the base abstract a proton from position 3 or 5? But those are meta to Br, so less acidic. Maybe under strong basic conditions, the para position's H (position 4) is abstracted, but that's not adjacent to Br, so elimination doesn't happen. So what would happen in that case?

If the H is abstracted from position 4, which is para to Br, the ring would have a negative charge at position 4. But then, with Br at position 1, perhaps a substitution could occur, but that's unlikely in this case because Br is a poor leaving group in aromatic substitution without activating groups.

Wait, no. In aromatic substitution, the leaving group typically leaves only after the ring is activated. For example, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which is not the case here with Br as a substituent.

So perhaps the only feasible reaction is elimination, leading to one product.

Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of the base abstracting a proton from another position, leading to a different product? Suppose the base abstracts a proton from position 3. But that's meta to Br, so less acidic. So it's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the base could abstract a proton from position 5, which is also meta to Br, but again, less acidic. So the most likely position is position 6.

So, perhaps only one product is formed: the benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, and D at position 2.

Wait, but the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. So if only one product is formed, the answer is B) 1. But let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps there are other possibilities. For example, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination, but the double bond could form in a different position due to ring rotation or resonance. But in benzene, the positions are fixed, so the double bond would be between 1 and 6.

Wait, but another possibility: if the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to Br, but not adjacent, so elimination can't happen. But perhaps the resulting benzide anion could undergo some other reaction, like loss of Br- to form a new ring structure.

Wait, but without elimination, what else could happen? Maybe the Br could leave as Br-, but that would require a good leaving group. In this case, Br is a good leaving group, but without a base abstracting a proton adjacent to it, the leaving may not proceed via E2 mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the base could induce a substitution reaction where Br is replaced by an amide group from the ammonia. But NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, not typically a nucleophile in such reactions without activating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a deuterium and a new substituent from the ammonia, but I'm not sure about that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the reaction again. The reaction is treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to the formation of a styrene-like compound, where the Br is replaced by a double bond.

So, if elimination occurs, the product would be benzene with a double bond between the positions where Br and H were removed. So, the product would be 1,2-dideuteroethylene-benzene or something similar. But wait, the D is at position 2; when H is removed from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. So the double bond would be between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but that would mean the product has a double bond between C1 and C6, and D at C2. So the structure would be 1,6-dideutero-1,2-diphenylethylene? I'm not sure about the exact name, but the point is, only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces two products because the D is in position 2, and the double bond could form in two different positions. Wait, but in this case, the only possible elimination is between C1 and C6 because the H is abstracted from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br).

Wait, but in the ring, C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So if the H is abstracted from C6, elimination between C1 and C6 forms a double bond, making a structure where C1 and C6 are double-bonded. So the product would be 1,6-dideutero-1,3-diphenylpropene or something similar. But I'm not entirely certain.

But regardless of the structure, the main point is that elimination leads to only one product because the H can only be abstracted from position 6, leading to one possible double bond.

Wait, but another possibility: the reaction could occur via a different pathway, leading to a different product. For example, the base could abstract a proton that's para to Br, but not adjacent, leading to a different elimination scenario. But I don't think that would happen because elimination requires H and leaving group to be adjacent.

So, perhaps only one product is formed.

Wait, but the question says "how many possible organic products." So if only one product is formed, the answer is B) 1.

Wait, but another thought: when the base abstracts a proton, the ring could form a diradical or something, leading to different structures. Or perhaps the base could abstract a proton from another position, leading to a different product. But I think that's unlikely because the H at position 6 is the most acidic.

Wait, another angle: the deuterium at position 2 is a specific isotope. So when the base abstracts a proton, it might not affect the deuterium, but the product structure would be the same regardless of the D's presence. So the product is a single compound.

Therefore, the number of possible products is 1. So the answer should be B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that typically abstracts protons, leading to elimination or substitution reactions. In this case, the most likely pathway is elimination (E2 mechanism), as Br is a good leaving group, and the reaction conditions favor dehydrohalogenation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2. The bromine at position 1 is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), making the ortho and para protons more acidic.

2. **Acidity of Protons**:  
   - The protons at positions 6 (ortho to Br) and 4 (para to Br) are more acidic due to the EWG effect of Br.  
   - The proton at position 6 is ortho to Br and adjacent to the Br atom, making it the most acidic and the most likely candidate for deprotonation by NaNH₂.

3. **Mechanism of Elimination**:  
   - Deprotonation at position 6 forms a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6.  
   - The Br atom at position 1 is eliminated as Br⁻, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6.  
   - The deuterium at position 2 remains unaffected, as it is not involved in the reaction.

4. **Possible Products**:  
   - The elimination reaction results in a single product: a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 and a deuterium at position 2.  
   - No other products are possible because the base cannot abstract protons from positions 3, 4, or 5 (these are less acidic, and elimination requires the H and Br to be adjacent).

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces only one organic product due to the specific pathway of elimination and the structure of the starting material.
