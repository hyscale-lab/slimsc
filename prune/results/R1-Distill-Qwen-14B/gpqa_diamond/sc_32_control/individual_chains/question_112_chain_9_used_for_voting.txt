Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about calculating probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let me read the problem again.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. And I'm supposed to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix is Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Then find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional. Then, find the eigenstates of the operator A. Wait, but since A is a 2x2 matrix, maybe I can diagonalize it to find its eigenstates and eigenvalues.

Let me write down what the operator A looks like. It's a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero (since it's zero when i=j) and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So A is:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix representation is Aij. So when i≠j, Aij = hbar/2. So the matrix is:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Right. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Because the eigenstates of A would be the possible measurement outcomes. Because when you measure an operator, the possible states the system can collapse into are the eigenstates of that operator.

So, to find the eigenvalues of A, I can solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

The matrix (A - λI) is:

[ -λ     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  -λ    ]

The determinant is λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

So λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues would be ± hbar/2. So the eigenstates corresponding to these eigenvalues are the vectors we need to compute the probabilities for.

Wait, but wait a minute—no, wait. Because the operator A as given is a 2x2 matrix. Let me think again. The eigenvalues would be the solutions to (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = hbar/2 and λ = -hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, the operator A is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * X. Because X has 1s off-diagonal, so A would be (hbar/2) times X. So the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2) times the eigenvalues of X. Since X's eigenvalues are ±1, A's are ±hbar/2. That makes sense.

Now, the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of X, because they're proportional. The eigenstates of X are the states |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvectors for A should be found by solving (A - λI)|v> = 0.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2)I) is:

[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ]

So the equations are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1,1), which when normalized is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + (hbar/2)I) is:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Which gives equations (hbar/2)(v1 + v2) = 0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but no, in the standard basis, |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1). So |+x> is (1 1)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (1 -1)/sqrt(2).

So now, the state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. But first, I need to normalize this state.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = 1+i and b = 2 -i.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

|a|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|b|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, which are |+x> and |−x>.

The probability is the square of the amplitude of each eigenstate in |alpha>.

So, the probability P(+x) is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and P(-x) is |< -x | alpha > |^2.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, and the eigenstates are expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, perhaps I can compute the inner products directly.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | alpha > + < down | alpha > ]

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, the inner product is:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1,0) | (1+i, 2 -i) ] + (0,1) | (1+i, 2 -i) ]

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:

Each |up> is represented as (1,0), |down> as (0,1). So the state |alpha> before normalization is (1+i, 2 -i).

Wait, let me consider the state |alpha> as a column vector: [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

The eigenstate |+x> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1]^T, and |−x> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T.

Now, the inner product < +x | alpha > (before normalization) is [ (1/sqrt(2)), (1/sqrt(2)) ] multiplied by [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

So that's (1/sqrt(2))(1+i + 2 -i) ) = (1/sqrt(2))(3 ) = 3/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, because I have to consider the normalization of |alpha>. So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product < +x | alpha-normalized > is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So that's [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 - i = 3 → 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14). Then the probability is (3/sqrt(14)) squared, which is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha-normalized >:

Inner product is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i → (-1 + 2i).

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 (about 64.29%) and 5/14 ≈35.71%.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Wait, the sum of probabilities should be 1. 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches these approximately. But let me check the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Wait, but then the average value of the operator A is also needed.

The average value is <alpha | A | alpha>.

Since A is the operator with matrix [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]], the expectation value is (1/sqrt(7)^2) * [ (1+i)(0)(1+i) + (1+i)(hbar/2)(2-i) + (2-i)(hbar/2)(1+i) + (2-i)(0)(2-i) ) ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it in vector form. The state |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So when you apply operator A to |alpha>, you get:

A|alpha> = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ] * [a, b]^T = [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

Then the expectation value is <alpha | A | alpha> = [a* , b* ] * A | alpha> / (sqrt(7))²?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |alpha> is already normalized, so <alpha| is [ a*, b* ] / sqrt(7).

But wait, the expectation value is:

< alpha | A | alpha > = (1/7) [ (1-i) (hbar/2)(2 -i) ) + ( (2 +i) (hbar/2)(1 +i) ) ]

Because a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* is (1-i)/sqrt(7). Similarly, b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7), so b* is (2 +i)/sqrt(7}).

So compute the two terms:

Term 1: (1 -i) * (hbar/2) * (2 -i)
Term 2: (2 +i) * (hbar/2) * (1 +i)

So let's compute each term.

Term1: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i² = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Multiply by (hbar/2): (1 -3i)(hbar/2).

Term2: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2(i) + i(1) + i(i)
= 2 + 2i +i + i²
= 2 +3i -1
= 1 +3i.

Multiply by (hbar/2): (1 +3i)(hbar/2).

Now, add Term1 and Term2:

(1-3i +1+3i) * (hbar/2) = (2) * (hbar/2) = hbar.

So the denominator is 7, so <A> = (hbar) /7.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the expectation value is (Term1 + Term2)/(7) * (hbar/2) * 2? Or did I do the scaling correctly?

Wait, let me re-calculate the expectation:

E = (1/7) [ (1-i)(hbar/2)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(hbar/2)(1+i) ]

So factor out (hbar/2)(1/7):

E = (hbar/2)(1/7) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute the two products:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Sum: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So E = (hbar/2)(1/7)(2) )= (hbar/2)(2/7) ) = hbar/(7).

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 (for +x) and 0.36 (for -x), and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's matching.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of the probabilities.

Earlier, when I calculated < +x | alpha >, I found the inner product to be 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64, as in option A.

Similarly, the other probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.3571, which rounds to 0.36.

So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5.
\]

The total norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). These eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are calculated using the overlap between \( |\alpha\rangle \) and these eigenstates. The inner products are:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( A \) and \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value simplifies to:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
