Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. So if one astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just 0.1c. Wait, so what's the formula again? Oh right, the relative velocity u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). But wait, wait. Let me make sure I have the signs right. Oh yeah, both are moving in the positive x-direction, so u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that denominator. 0.6 *0.5 is 0.3, and when multiplied by c squared, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a start.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has rest mass, but they're moving, so their energies are their relativistic energies. The energy E for each is gamma * m c squared. Wait, but the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So I need to calculate their energies separately and then add them.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c). Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)). 0.25 is (0.5)^2. So 1 - 0.25 =0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) which is approximately 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 *3m *c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² ≈ 5.964 mc². So about 5.96 mc² when rounded. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So option C must be the correct choice.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations. Let me do the gamma for the first one again. 0.6c speed: 1 - (0.6)^2 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. Gamma is 5/4, which is 1.25. So 1.25 * 2m = 2.5 m. So 2.5 mc². Correct.

Second astronaut: 0.5c. 1 - (0.5)^2 is 0.75. So sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So 1.1547 *3m is about 3.464 m. So 3.464 mc². Adding them together gives 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc². So yes, option C is correct.

So looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \). This eliminates options A and B, which do not match this value.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

1. For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
   \]

2. For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
   \]

Adding the two energies:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2**
