Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a chemist performing two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B. Each is treated with a different reducing agent: one uses LiBH4 and H+, and the other uses BH3 and H+. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to figure out what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, okay, so the product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? So this is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one, which would be a cyclic hemiacetal or something? Or maybe a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or maybe it's formed from a cyclic ketone plus something. Oh wait, maybe it's formed from a ketone and an alcohol via reduction. Or perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone group.

Looking at the reactions: the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3, both are reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, to alcohols. BH3 is also a reducing agent, maybe for ketones as well. Wait, but sometimes BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which add to alkenes. Hmm, but in the presence of H+ after that, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester or an acid. Because the product is a ketone, perhaps the starting material was an ester that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Wait, but the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. A six-membered ring with oxygen in the 5 position? Or wait, numbering: position 2 is the ketone, and position 4 has an ethyl group. So the ring is O as one member, and then positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, no, pyran has six atoms, with one oxygen. So the numbering would have oxygen at position 1, then positions 2 to 6 around the ring.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the product as a cyclic hemiacetal from a diol and a ketone or aldehyde. But I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, the product could be a cyclic ketone, as in the case of a cyclic hemiacetal from a diol and a ketone. Wait, maybe it's formed via a ketone undergoing some kind of cyclization after reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, when treated with a reducing agent, forms an alcohol which then forms a cyclic ether. Or maybe the starting material is an ester with a ketone group, and the reduction leads to a secondary alcohol which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone which, upon reduction, forms a diol, and then undergoes some kind of cyclization to form the pyran ring. But I'm not entirely certain.

Looking at the products, they are both (R) and (S) configurations, so the reactions must involve some kind of stereoselective process, like the reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol with retention of configuration or something similar.

Wait, another approach: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but usually it reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. BH3 would also typically reduce carbonyl groups, but perhaps with different selectivity. Alternatively, BH3 could be involved in hydroboration, but that's for alkenes. So in this case, since the product is a ketone, maybe the starting material was an ester or an acid with a carbonyl group that's being reduced.

Wait, wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. For example, if you have an ester like an acyl ester, and you reduce it, you'd get a diol. No, wait, reducing an ester would give you a secondary alcohol, not a diol. Because an ester RCOOR' would reduce to RCH2OR' (if using LiAlH4, for example), but LiBH4 might not reduce esters. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The product is a cyclic ketone, but the starting materials are being treated with reducing agents. So perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl compound which is being reduced to form the ring.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester or something similar. For example, if you have a β-keto ester, and you reduce it, you could form a ring.

Wait, let's think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring, with the ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So that would be a structure like O in position 1, position 2 is the ketone, position 4 is CH2CH2CH3? Or wait, ethyl is CH2CH2.

Wait, maybe the product is formed from a cyclic hemiacetal. So, perhaps the starting material is a diol with a ketone group. No, wait, that's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the pinacol rearrangement. Wait, the pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (pinacol) is dehydrated to form a carbonyl compound. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. Or perhaps a lactone, which upon reduction would form a diol, which could then form a ring.

Wait, let me think about the possible starting material structures. The options given are all (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, pentanoic acid with substituents.

Looking at option A: A is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and B is the same. Option C has A as (S), B as (R).

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So maybe the structure is CH2CH2CO... Wait, let me draw it.

Pentanoic acid has five carbons, with a carboxylic acid group at one end. The substituents are at position 3 and 5. So, 3-ethyl and 5-isobutoxy, and 5-oxo. Wait, the 5-oxo would be a ketone group at position 5. So that's a pentanoic acid with a ketone at position 5 and an ethyl at position 3, and an isobutoxy group at position 5? Wait, but that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps it's 3-ethyl, 5-isobutoxy, and 5-oxo. So positions 3,5.

So the structure would be: 

Carboxylic acid at position 1.
Positions 2: CH2.
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl group].
Position 4: CH2.
Position 5: C(O) (from oxo) and also an isobutoxy group (O-CH(CH2CH2CH3)2)?

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. If it's 5-isobutoxy, then at position 5, there's an isobutoxy group (O-CH(CH2CH3)2), but also a 5-oxo group, which would be a ketone. So the same carbon (position 5) has both the ketone (as a carbonyl) and the isobutoxy group? That doesn't seem possible, because a carbon can't have both a carbonyl and an oxygen as a substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a pentanoic acid where position 5 has both an isobutoxy group and a carbonyl group. But that would imply a structure like:

CH2-COOH (position 1: carboxylic acid)
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: C(O) with an isobutoxy group attached? But that's not possible because the carbonyl is a double bond; the carbon can't have another substituent. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a β-keto ester. For example, the starting material could be a β-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol, which then could cyclize into a ring.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester that, when reduced, forms a secondary alcohol. But then, how does that form a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester like a cyclic ester, a lactone. When it is reduced, it forms a diol, which can then form the pyran ring via cyclization.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a carbonyl group, and upon reduction, that carbonyl becomes a diol, which then forms a ring.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Another approach: think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for esters, ketones, and aldehydes. BH3 is also a reducing agent but maybe in a different context, perhaps for esters or maybe for epoxides. Alternatively, maybe LiBH4 is used for ketones, and BH3 is used for alkenes. Wait, no, BH3 is more commonly used in hydroboration reactions with alkenes.

Wait, but in the problem, the product of each reaction is a ketone, but both reactions are reductions. Maybe the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol. Then, this alcohol could undergo cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. Suppose the starting material is an ester with the structure RCOOR'. When LiBH4 is used, it would reduce the ester to RCH2OR', but LiBH4 isn't usually strong enough to reduce esters. Wait, LiAlH4 is used to reduce esters, not LiBH4. Oh, right, LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters, but LiAlH4 does. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone. When you reduce a ketone with LiBH4, you get a secondary alcohol. If the starting material is a cyclic ketone, then the product after reduction would be a cyclic secondary alcohol, but in this case, the product is a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When you reduce a β-keto ester, it can form a secondary alcohol. Let me think: a β-keto ester has a structure like RCOCOR'. When you reduce it, you might get RCH(OH)COR'—no, wait, maybe it's more like RCH2-CO-R'. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an α,β-unsaturated ester. When you reduce that with LiBH4, it would add to the double bond, forming a diol. Then, maybe that diol undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, let me think this through. If the starting material is an α,β-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOR, and you reduce it with BH3, you'd get the diol. Then, under acidic conditions, that diol could undergo cyclization to form a ring, perhaps a six-membered ring with an ether linkage, forming the pyran structure.

But in this case, the product is a ketone, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, the diol could lose water to form an alkene and then undergo some reaction.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the product. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The ring has a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C2
|
C1-O-C3
|
C4 (with ethyl)
|
C5
|
C6

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the ring as O connected to C1 and C6, with C2 being a carbonyl, and the ring being saturated (tetrahydro means four hydrogen atoms added, so it's a six-membered ring with one double bond, but I'm not sure where). Alternatively, tetrahydro could mean four single bonds, so the ring is fully saturated, making it a cyclic hemiacetal or similar.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the ring is not fully saturated. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol and a ketone. But how would that form from a reduction?

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester with a carbonyl group. Let's say the ester is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. When reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps the alcohol can undergo an intramolecular cyclization with another part of the molecule to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When reduced, it forms a secondary alcohol, which then can undergo elimination to form a ring with a carbonyl group.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me try to approach it differently.

The key is to determine what the starting materials A and B are such that when treated with LiBH4 and H+ (for A) and BH3 and H+ (for B), they produce the R and S configurations respectively.

Wait, the product is a chiral center at which position? In the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the chiral center would be at position 4, which has the ethyl group, or perhaps another position. Wait, maybe the configuration is due to the reduction step, determining whether the resulting alcohol is R or S.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a ketone group, and upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol. The configuration of the alcohol would depend on the reducing agent. LiBH4 and BH3 might affect the stereochemistry differently.

Wait, but BH3 is typically used for hydroboration, which follows anti-Markovnikov addition and has a certain stereochemistry, like BH3 adding to alkenes in a way that the boron attaches to the less substituted carbon, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde, and the reduction forms a primary alcohol. But in the product, it's a secondary alcohol, as it's a ketone-derived structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stereochemistry of the products. The problem says that when compound A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. When compound B is treated with BH3 and H+, it produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, so the same product is formed, but with opposite configurations. That suggests that the starting materials A and B are enantiomers, and the reducing agents are leading to different configurations in the product.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically used for ketones. BH3 is maybe a milder reagent but perhaps used in a different context. Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions influence the stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epimers, and the reducing agents cause different configurations in the product. Or maybe the starting materials are diastereomers, and the reaction leads to different stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are β-keto esters with different configurations, and the reduction leads to the formation of the alcohol which then cyclizes into the pyran ring, with the configuration determined by the starting material's configuration.

Wait, let's think about what each reagent does. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters, ketones, and aldehydes. BH3, on the other hand, can also reduce ketones and aldehydes but perhaps with different stereochemical outcomes. Wait, actually, BH3 is used in the formation of hydroxylamines, but I'm not sure about its role here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a carbonyl group to form an alcohol, and the configuration of the alcohol is determined by the reagent. For example, LiBH4 might lead to a certain configuration, while BH3 with H+ leads to the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials have a certain configuration that, upon reduction, leads to either R or S configuration in the product.

Wait, in the options, the starting materials are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with either R or S configuration. So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3, 5, and 5. So position 5 has both an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo). Wait, that can't be right because a carbon can't have both a carbonyl and an oxygen substituent. So perhaps the structure is a β-keto ester, like RCOCH2COO-R'.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, where the β position has a ketone. Then, when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, leading to a diastereomer depending on the reagent.

Wait, but in the options, the starting materials are pentanoic acids with substituents. So, for example, the structure would be:

CH2CH2COOH (position 1)
Position 3: ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3)
Position 5: isobutoxy and oxo groups.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because position 5 can't have both a carbonyl and an ether oxygen. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure is:

Carboxylic acid group at position 1.
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: C(O) [oxo] and OCH(CH2CH3)2 [isobutoxy].

Wait, but that would require the same carbon (position 5) to have both a carbonyl group and an oxygen substituent. Which is impossible because a carbonyl is a double bond, so the carbon can't have any other substituents. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the 5-oxo refers to a ketone on the same carbon as the isobutoxy group. But that's not possible. Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, but the options don't mention that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a β-keto ester, but a γ-keto ester. So the ketone is on position 5, and the ester is on position 5 as well. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, but the description in the options is a bit different. Let's think: the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to interpret 5-oxo is that it's a ketone group on carbonyl at position 5. So position 5 would have a carbonyl, and the isobutoxy group would be attached to another position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH2-COOH (positions 1,2,3)
Wait, no, wait, the pentanoic acid has five carbons. So:

Positions 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl]
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: C(O) (oxo) and OCH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy).

But that's the same problem as before. So perhaps the structure is that the oxo is at position 4, or another position.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid. So the structure would be:

CH2-COOH (position 1 and 2)
Position 3: CH2
Position 4: C(O) (ketone)
Position 5: ?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the stereochemistry.

So, when you reduce a ketone with a chiral center, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the reagents and the starting material's configuration.

LiBH4 is known to be a chiral reducing agent. Wait, no, LiBH4 is a achiral reducing agent, but if the starting material has a chiral center, the reduction could lead to retention or inversion of configuration, or perhaps racemization.

Wait, but in reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the mechanism is typically a two-step process: first, the ketone attacks by the hydride, leading to a planar intermediate (like a tetrahedral borane intermediate), and then protonation. So the configuration is determined by the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but if the starting ketone is prochiral, the reduction would create a new chiral center, and the configuration would depend on the hydride source and any chiral environment.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, the reduction might form a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the same product is formed from different starting materials depending on the reducing agent. For example, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, and depending on the reducing agent, the stereochemistry at the new chiral center is R or S.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible options. The options are all about whether A and B are the same or different, and their configurations.

Options:

A) A and B are both (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

B) Both are (R).

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

The product from A is (R), and from B is (S). So A must be a starting material that leads to R, and B leads to S.

Assuming that the starting material determines the configuration, perhaps the configuration of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product.

Wait, but in the case of reduction of a ketone, the product's configuration is determined by the approach of the hydride. If the starting ketone is not chiral, the reduction could produce a racemic mixture. But if the starting ketone is chiral, perhaps the configuration is influenced by the existing chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reducing agents cause the formation of the opposite configuration in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) influence the stereochemistry of the reduction.

Wait, another angle: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to retention of configuration in certain reductions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, BH3 might have different selectivity.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the starting material's structure again. Since the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then loses a small molecule (like water) to form the ring.

Wait, for example, consider a β-keto ester like CH2-CO-COOR. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone group would become a CH2 group, producing CH2-CH2-COOR. But that doesn't seem to form a ring. Alternatively, maybe the ester group undergoes reduction as well, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization.

Wait, but without a clear picture of the starting structure, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should think about the options. The options suggest that A and B are either the same or different in their configuration.

Given that the products are enantiomers (R and S), perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reducing agents lead to the opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, but if the starting material is R, and the reduction leads to the same configuration, then the product would be R. But here, the product from A is R, and from B is S, so perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reducing agents cause the opposite configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials have the same configuration, and the reagents cause the products to have opposite configurations.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach is to think about how the configuration of the starting material affects the configuration of the product when reduced.

If the starting material is a β-keto ester with a certain configuration, the reduction might lead to a specific diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a carbonyl group. When reduced, it forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider that the product is formed from a cyclic hemiacetal. So the starting material might have a carbonyl group that reduces to form an alcohol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a γ-keto ester. For example, CH2CH2COCH2COOR. When reduced, the ketone becomes CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2COOR. Then, perhaps the OH and the COOR groups undergo cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Hmm, but I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an α,β-unsaturated ester. When reduced, it forms a diol which then cyclizes.

But without a clear understanding of the mechanism, it's hard to proceed.

Another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl compound that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol, which then loses a leaving group (like a hydroxyl) to form the ring and a new carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction leads to a diol, which then loses a water molecule to form a double bond, which can undergo cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the options again.

The options are about the starting material's configuration. For option D, A is R and B is S. Since the products are R and S, perhaps the starting materials are in the opposite configurations.

If A produces R and B produces S, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So when A is R, reducing it gives R product, and when B is S, reducing gives S product.

Wait, but that would suggest that the starting material's configuration is the same as the product's. So if A is R, and upon reduction gives R, then B, being S, would upon reduction give S.

But I'm not sure if the configuration is retained through reduction.

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration at the new chiral center is determined by the approach of the hydride. If the starting ketone is prochiral, the reduction can form either R or S based on the reagent.

Wait, another thought: the product's configuration (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent's approach. So if the starting material is R, and the reagent adds the hydride from the same face, the product would be R. If the reagent adds from the opposite face, it would be S.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't chiral, but the product becomes chiral upon reduction.

Wait, let's try to imagine that the starting material is a β-keto ester with a certain configuration. Upon reduction, it forms a secondary alcohol, which then forms the ring. The configuration of the alcohol would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is a β-keto ester with configuration R, then upon reduction, the alcohol would have configuration R, leading to the product being R. Similarly, if the starting material is S, the product would be S.

So, looking at the options, the products are R and S. So A must be R, and B must be S, or vice versa.

Looking at the options, option D is A=R, B=S. So when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it produces R-product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces S-product.

But wait, I'm not sure if the reagent affects the configuration. Alternatively, maybe the reagent doesn't influence the configuration, and it's the starting material's configuration that determines the product's.

In that case, the correct option would have A as R and B as S, so that when they're reduced, the products are R and S respectively.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A = (R), B = (S).

So that would make sense. Because A is R, and it's treated with LiBH4, it produces R-product. B is S, treated with BH3, produces S-product.

So the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the starting materials A and B that, when treated with different reducing agents (LiBH4 + H+ and BH3 + H+), produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The key is to analyze the stereochemistry of the reactions and the configurations of the starting materials.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a chiral cyclic ketone with a ketone group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which differ in their stereochemistry at the chiral center.

When a β-keto ester like the starting material is reduced, the configuration of the resulting alcohol is influenced by the configuration of the starting material. If the starting material is (R), the reduction will produce the (R)-configured product, and if the starting material is (S), the reduction will produce the (S)-configured product. This relationship holds because the stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product.

Given that compound A produces the (R)-configured product and compound B produces the (S)-configured product, it follows that A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This matches the stereochemical relationship described in option D.

Answer: D
