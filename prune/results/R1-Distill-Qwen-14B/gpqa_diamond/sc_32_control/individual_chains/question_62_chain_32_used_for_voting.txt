Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to think about the structure of the target molecule. So, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's see, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group and a formyl (carbaldehyde) group. So, it looks like the cyclohexane has two substituents: one is a CH2OH that's connected to a cyclohexyl group, and the other is a CHO group.

Wait, no, maybe I should draw it mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane. One carbon has a substituent that's -CH2-C(OH)-cyclohexyl? Or is it a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is on the cyclohexane. Oh, right, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has a methyl group at position 1, which is substituted with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl. So that's like (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl attached to the cyclohexane. And then the same cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group perhaps on another carbon. Wait, no, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the cyclohexane has a carbonyl group (CHO) attached. So, the substituents are at adjacent positions perhaps?

Wait, maybe the structure is as follows: the cyclohexane ring has a substituent on carbon 1, which is a CH2 group. This CH2 has two substituents: one is OH (so it's a hydroxymethyl group), and the other is a cyclohexyl group. So, the CH2 is connected to the cyclohexane, and also to OH and cyclohexyl. So the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl attached to the cyclohexane. Then, the same ring has a formyl group (CHO) attached at another position, say, adjacent.

Wait, but the way the name is written might be different. Maybe the main chain is cyclohexane with a formyl group, and a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent would be a cyclohexane ring attached via a CH2 group that also has a hydroxyl group.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, or is it cyclohexane attached directly to the triple bond? No, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C- group. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with one carbon attached to a triple bond: the structure would be cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

Wait, that's right. So the molecule is cyclohexane with a carbon (let's say position 1) attached to a triple bond (C≡CH). So, the structure is:

Cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no: ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, it's CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexyl-ethynyl. So, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane attached to a triple bond. So, the compound is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. So, the structure is:

Cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, that would be 1-ethynylcyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a triple bond attached directly: cyclohexyl-C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached to one of its carbons.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached. Now, what reactions can I perform on that to get the target molecule.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps I need to add a formyl group and a substituent with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Let me think about the steps needed.

Option 1: Maybe first, I can perform a Grignard reaction or some kind of alkyne reaction.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. So perhaps I can deprotonate the alkyne and then do some alkylation, maybe.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps I can form that substituent via a substitution or addition.

Wait, maybe the steps involve:

1. First, reduce the triple bond to a double bond or to an alkene. Then, perform some kind of dihydroxylation or epoxidation, followed by ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be functionalized in a way to add substituents.

Wait, let's think about the steps in the options and see.

Looking at the options, they have a series of reagents:

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, perhaps for alkynes to form metal acetylides. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent.

So first step: treat ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. This would deprotonate the alkyne (if possible) and then methylate.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (C≡CH). Deprotonating the terminal alkyne with NaNH2 would form the acetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, adding methyl chloride would methylate it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's 1-propyne. Wait, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (CH2C≡CH attached), but if you deprotonate and add CH3Cl, you'd get CH2C≡C-CH2Cl? Or would it form a longer chain?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Treating with NaNH2 would deprotonate to cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the product is 1-propyne attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but the first step in option A is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which would give us a propyne derivative.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, that would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a single bond, but how?

Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically reduce it to a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two H's added on each carbon.

Wait, no, more accurately, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst would first add H's to make a double bond (alkene) and then further hydrogenate to a single bond (alkane). So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 after full hydrogenation.

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to get us closer to the target molecule. The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Let me think of the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, with a substituent at position 1 which is a CH2 group attached to OH and a cyclohexyl group. And the same ring has a CHO group somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the main ring is a cyclohexane with a formyl group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the target can be thought of as a cyclohexane ring having two substituents: a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with a C≡CH group). How can I get from here to the target?

Perhaps the alkyne can be modified to add a formyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, one approach is to functionalize the alkyne into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an enol ether or something else, then undergo some kind of nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a hydroboration or some cyclopropane opening, but I'm not sure.

Let me look again at the reagents in each option.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would probably form an ethyl-substituted acetylide. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a Birch reduction condition, but more commonly used for aromatic rings. Wait, maybe Li and NH3 is used for deprotonating something else, like in the formation of enolates or for alkyne alkylation.

Wait, after step 1, the product is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3 (if ethyl chloride is used). Then, step 2 with Li and NH3 might deprotonate the acetylide further? Not sure.

Then O3/H2O is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But after step 2, if the product is an alkyne, then ozonolysis might not do much. Unless step 2 converts the alkyne into a diene.

Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly. Let's think about the steps.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: form the methyl acetylide, giving a propyne. Step 2: H2 and Pd-CaCO3. Wait, hydrogenation of the triple bond would reduce it to a single bond, so propyne becomes propane.

Then, step 3: O3 in (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used on alkenes. But if the molecule is now propane, which is a single bond, ozonolysis would have nothing to react with. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule isn't propane. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is catalytic hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes a single bond. So the structure after step 2 is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a straight chain. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis. But ozonolysis works on double bonds, so perhaps I'm missing a step that creates a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction in step 2 is something else. H2/Pd-CaCO3 is typically for hydrogenation, but maybe in some cases, it's used for dehydrogenation? No, probably hydrogenation.

So, if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, then step 3 is ozonolysis, which won't do anything. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm, step 1: NaNH2 is a strong base, but with methanol. Maybe it's doing an alkyne deprotonation followed by methylation? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol might form the acetylide, but I'm not sure. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which I think is for Birch reductions, but I'm not certain. Then ozonolysis and workup.

Not quite sure. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach: let's think about what needs to be done to the starting material.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH). I need to get to a molecule with a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

One possible approach is to first functionalize the alkyne. Maybe convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group.

Wait, how can I convert a terminal alkyne into a carbonyl? One method is through oxidation. Ozonolysis of a triple bond doesn't directly give a carbonyl, but perhaps other methods.

Wait, another approach: the alkyne can be converted into a ketone via a hydroxylation followed by oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps via a hydration reaction. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (like the oxymercuration), but that typically works for alkenes. Wait, but for alkynes, perhaps using certain conditions can produce ketones.

Wait, no, for alkynes, catalytic hydration (using H2SO4 and HgSO4) can add water across the triple bond to form a ketone. Oh wait, yes! So, if I have a terminal alkyne like ethynylcyclohexane, and I treat it with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (hydration catalyst), it would add water to form a ketone. So, cyclohexyl-C≡CH + H2O → cyclohexyl-C(OH)CH3?

Wait, no, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡C-R) typically gives a ketone R-C(O)-CH3. Wait, no: for a terminal alkyne R-C≡CH, hydration would give R-C(OH)-CH3, but under the right conditions, it can be a ketone. Wait, actually, the hydration of a terminal alkyne usually adds across the triple bond, giving an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, hydration would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C(O)H? Or cyclohexyl-C(O)-CH3?

Wait, let me get this straight. When H2O is added to a terminal alkyne, it can form either an enol or a ketone. For example, HgSO4 and H2SO4 are used as catalysts for hydration. So, for ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH), the hydration would add H and OH across the triple bond to form cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH3, which would then tautomerize to cyclohexyl-C(O)CH3, a ketone.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think about the mechanism. The addition of Hg(OH)2 across the triple bond would form a mercurinium ion, leading to the opening. For a terminal alkyne, the hydration would add H to the triple bond's sp-hybridized carbon (the one with the H). So the product would be an enol: the alkyne becomes a carbonyl with an adjacent CH2 group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. For ethynylcyclohexane, the hydration would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C(OH)H, which can tautomerize to cyclohexyl-C(OH)CH2H, but that's not a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is a ketone. So, starting from R-C≡CH, after hydration, it becomes R-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone.

Wait, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't right now, I'll proceed with my understanding.

Assuming that the hydration of ethynylcyclohexane gives a ketone, say cyclohexylacetone (cyclohexyl-C(O)-CH3), then what's next?

But our target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the ketone needs to be oxidized further to a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde.

Wait, oxidation of a ketone (R2CO) doesn't usually give a carboxylic acid, as ketones are generally resistant to oxidation. But wait, maybe if the ketone is at a certain position, it can be oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, but that's more common for alkenes.

Another approach: the reagents in the options may involve using NaNH2, then something else, followed by hydrogenation, then ozonolysis or something else.

Wait, looking back at option B: The steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in liquid NH3 (maybe for alkyne alkylation or some Birch reduction), then ozonolysis, then NH4OH.

Wait, maybe after the alkyne is methylated, the triple bond is converted to a single bond. Then, perhaps we form a double bond via dehydrohalogenation, which can be ozonized.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming an acetylide, then alkylation with ethyl chloride to form a longer alkyne, then Li and NH3 could be for deprotonating and forming a more substituted alkyne, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach: the target has a formyl group. How can I introduce that? One way is through oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. So, perhaps I need to introduce a hydroxyl group at a certain position and then oxidize it.

So, steps could be:

1. Functionalize the alkyne to add a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but that's the substituent we need. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane ring via some [2+2] addition, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe the alkyne can be converted into a benzene ring via some cyclization, but that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, another angle: think about the target molecule as having a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a CHO group. So perhaps I can form that substituent through a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a Grignard reagent, which can then add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a cyclohexylmethyl alcohol. How?

Wait, perhaps via hydrohalogenation and then substitution. For example, adding HCl to the alkyne, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so adding HCl would form a chloroalkane.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, using NaNH2 and a methylating agent would give a methyl-substituted alkyne.

Wait, let's go back to the options.

Option B: step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. That would form the ethyl acetylide, making the alkyne longer. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. That could cause elimination, perhaps forming an alkyne with more substituents or perhaps a diradical.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is for deprotonation of an alkene, but I'm not sure.

Step 3 is O3 followed by H2O (or something else?), which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if after step 2, I have a diene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But how does that fit into the target molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. For example, if step 1 gives a dihalide, then step 2 might eliminate to form a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's think about the target. The target has a cyclohexane with a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to OH and a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps that substituent is formed via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how to introduce both groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which can then be oxidized to a carbonyl group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkane, then functional groups are introduced. But that seems off.

Wait, another thought: the target has a formyl group (CHO). One way to introduce that is via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if I can form a primary alcohol on the cyclohexane ring, then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

So, steps could be:

1. Functionalize the alkyne to introduce a hydroxyl group.

2. Introduce a cyclohexyl group adjacent to it.

3. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how all that would happen with the given reagents.

Looking back at the options, option D includes NaNH2 and methanol as the first step. NaNH2 is a strong base and would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, which would then react with methanol. Wait, would the acetylide react with methanol? Methanol is a polar aprotic solvent, but the acetylide is a strong base and would deprotonate it. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is quenching the acetylide with methanol, giving an ethyl group substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 and CH3OH: when an acetylide is treated with an alcohol, it can form an alkyne with an ethyl group. Wait, no, the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+) would react with methanol (CH3OH) to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3-O-Na^+? No, wait, maybe the acetylide reacts with methanol to give the corresponding alcohol. Or perhaps it's a substitution where the OH group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with CH3OH to form a methyl ether. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option D is making the acetylide, then reacting with methanol to form a substitution product. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another approach: perhaps the target molecule is formed via a combination of alkyne functionalization, hydrogenation, and oxidation.

Wait, for instance, the alkyne is first converted into a cyclopropane, which upon ring-opening forms a diol, which can then be oxidized.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a cis-diol (but that's for alkenes, not alkynes). Oh wait, for alkynes, catalytic hydrogenation gives cis-dihydroxy groups? No, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's gives cis-diol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another alternative: the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, and then oxidized to a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

But the target has a primary aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is further oxidized, but I don't think that's possible. Alternatively, the ketone could undergo some kind of pinacol rearrangement, but that's more for vicinal diols.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a propyne. 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving propane. 3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → but if it's propane, nothing happens. So this can't be right.

Option B: Steps are 1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → forms a longer alkyne. 2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe deprotonation or elimination. 3. Ozonolysis → cleaves any double bonds. 4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps.

Wait, if after step 1, the alkyne is longer (say, ethyl group added), then step 2 (Li, NH3) might cause elimination to form a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is ammonium hydroxide, which would maybe form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, which is typically for aromatic rings, but maybe it's for some other purpose.

Hmm, not sure.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol; then Li and NH3; then ozonolysis; then NH4OH.

First step: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forming the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. Maybe an alkylation? Or perhaps it's a substitution, adding a methoxy group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: the target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl comes from a substitution.

Wait, so maybe the steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne into a primary alcohol.

2. Introduce a cyclohexyl group adjacent to it.

3. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-diol (using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-diol via another method.

Wait, another thought: the alkyne can be converted into a ketone via hydration (HgSO4, H2SO4), then the ketone is converted into a secondary alcohol via reduction (like NaBH4), but then how to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a primary alcohol via some method, then the primary alcohol is oxidized to CHO.

Wait, but I don't see any option that includes oxidation to CHO.

Looking at option B, which includes O3 and then NH4OH. Ozone is for cleaving alkenes, but if there's no alkene, that step wouldn't do anything. Unless an earlier step forms a double bond.

Wait, maybe the steps in option B are:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → form a longer alkyne (say, ethyl group added, making the alkyne longer).

2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps deprotonate and form a more substituted alkyne, or cause elimination to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Workup with NH4OH → maybe form aldehydes.

Hmm, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

But how does that help in forming the target molecule? The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group. So perhaps ozonolysis creates a carbonyl that becomes the formyl group, and another part becomes the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups. Then, one of them is further functionalized.

I'm not making much progress. Let me try another approach: think about each step's possible outcome.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe forms an acetylide, then reacts with methanol. Perhaps the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+) reacts with methanol to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe a Birch reduction, which would reduce aromatic rings, but cyclohexane is already a saturated ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for deprotonating something else, like an alkyne to form a lithium acetylide.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond. But in this case, after step 2, perhaps a double bond was formed. If Li and NH3 caused elimination of the acetylide to form a triple bond, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about each option's reagents and what they do.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a methyl-substituted acetylide. Then, H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but that's a single bond, so nothing happens. Then Ba(OH)2 → maybe saponify esters or something else. Doesn't fit.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3; H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3; Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination? Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration. But after all that, I don't see how a formyl group is introduced.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3; Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonate and eliminate to form a double bond, making R-C=C-CH2CH3; ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond, making two carbonyl groups; NH4OH → workup, making aldehydes or ketones.

If the starting material after step 2 is R-C=C-CH2CH3, ozonolysis would cleave it into R-C=O and O=CH2CH3. Wait, but that depends on where the double bond is.

Wait, if step 2 produces a diene, perhaps a conjugated diene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes. Then, step 4, which is NH4OH, might give hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if step 2 produces a mono-ene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the target's formyl group comes from one of the ozonolysis products. Then, the other part becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the other carbonyl is a ketone which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol. But I'm not seeing how that leads to the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: the correct option must involve steps that introduce both the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is itself attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps that substituent is formed via a coupling reaction or substitution.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which then reacts with a cyclohexyl halide to form the substituent. But I don't see Grignard reagents in the options.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a ketone, then performing a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction to form a CH2 group, which can then be substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, which then undergoes some kind of addition.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option B: it starts by methylating the alkyne, then perhaps forms an alkene via elimination, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups. One of them is the formyl group, and the other is processed into the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's think about which options involve introducing a formyl group. Ozonolysis can produce carbonyl groups, so any option with ozonolysis might be a candidate.

Option B and D have ozonolysis steps. So, perhaps the formyl group is formed from ozonolysis.

Now, considering the substituent that becomes the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group: perhaps it comes from a Grignard addition or some nucleophilic substitution.

Hmm, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Form an alkyne with a substituent.

2. Convert the alkyne into a diene or alkene.

3. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

4. Perform some workup to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option D: NaNH2, methanol; then Li and NH3; then ozonolysis; then NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 with methanol could form the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form an ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form the acetylide, then in step 2, Li in NH3 might abstract a proton to form a more substituted alkyne, but that's a stretch.

Another idea: perhaps the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps a cyclopropane ring is formed, which upon ring-opening gives the substituent.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with a cyclohexyl halide to form a cyclohexyl-substituted alkyne. Then, hydrogenation would add H's to form a CH2 group between two cyclohexanes.

Wait, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should go with the option that includes introducing a hydroxyl group via ozonolysis and then Ba(OH)2 or something else.

Looking back, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl. So, perhaps that's formed via a substitution reaction.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, like the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but more commonly, it's used to eliminate water from a vicinal diol to form an epoxide, but that's not right. Wait, no, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions, perhaps E2 mechanisms.

Wait, but in the options, option C uses Ba(OH)2 as step 3. So, after that, there's an O3 step.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, forming a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me try to outline the steps for option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → acetylide formed, then methylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → reduces the triple bond to a single bond, R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds. But after step 2, it's single bonds, so no reaction. So this can't be correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe step 3 in option C is using O3 on the hydrogenated product, which is a single bond, so nothing happens. So that can't be correct.

Another thought: perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Option B steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → form R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe deprotonate and form a more substituted alkyne, but I'm not certain.

3. O3/H2O → cleaves any double bonds into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes or ketones.

So, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. One of them could be the formyl group, and the other part might form the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure, but given the options, perhaps option B is the right one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the correct sequence of reagents must achieve the following transformations:

1. **Functionalize the alkyne**: Convert the terminal alkyne (-C≡CH) into a compound that can introduce the formyl group (CHO) and the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group (-CH(OH)-cyclohexyl).

2. **Introduce the formyl group**: This likely involves cleaving a double bond or a substituted alkyne to form a carbonyl group, which can then be oxidized or retained as an aldehyde.

3. **Form the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group**: This requires introducing a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group (-cyclohexyl) onto a methyl group (-CH2-).

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd**: Reduces the triple bond to a single bond, yielding R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially causing elimination or rearrangement, but it is unclear how this step introduces the formyl group.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration of a triple bond typically forms a ketone, but the triple bond has already been reduced in step 2. This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to form a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely causes elimination to form a double bond (R-C=C-CH₂CH₃).
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups, potentially forming an aldehyde and a ketone.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup step, likely to stabilize the carbonyl groups.

This sequence introduces both the formyl group (via ozonolysis) and sets up the structure for forming the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group. However, the exact formation of the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Forms a methyl-substituted alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Reduces the triple bond to a single bond, yielding R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, but the product from step 2 is a single bond, so no reaction occurs.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role is unclear in this sequence.

This sequence does not effectively introduce the formyl group or the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether (R-C≡C-OCH₃).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely causes elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but the product from step 2 is unclear.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup step, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

This sequence is ambiguous and does not clearly achieve the desired transformations.

### Conclusion:
Option B is the most plausible sequence. It introduces a double bond in step 2, which is cleaved by ozonolysis in step 3 to form carbonyl groups. This aligns with the formation of the formyl group and sets up the structure for forming the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group. While some steps are unclear, this option aligns best with the transformations needed to synthesize the target molecule.
