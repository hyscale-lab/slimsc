Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics. I think we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But wait, what's that formula again? Oh right, the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²), but wait, no, that's for when you're adding two velocities from different frames. But wait, in this problem, are we being asked about the relative speed between the two astronauts? Or is this more about the system's total energy?

Let me read the question again. It says: What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

So the first part is the relative speed between the two astronauts. The second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the relative speed. Both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. The first has a mass of 2m and speed 0.6c, the second has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Wait, but wait. If they are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? But wait, no, that's only if you're in a classical (non-relativistic) scenario. Because when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't just subtract them like that. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but when you're in the rest frame of one of them, what's the speed of the other? Let's think: let's say we're in the frame of the first astronaut (2m). Then, the second astronaut (3m) is moving at what speed relative to him?

So, according to the relativistic velocity addition formula, if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then the velocity v in S is related to v' in S' by v = (v' + u)/(1 + (v' u)/c²).

Wait, but in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in some frame S (probably the rest frame of the Earth or something). Astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from astronaut 1's perspective (S'), what is the speed of astronaut 2?

Wait, no, actually, I should think of the frame of the first astronaut as S'. So the Earth frame is S, and astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in S. So in S, astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c. So to find the speed of astronaut 2 in S' (the frame of astronaut 1), we use the formula:

v = (v' + u) / (1 + (v' u)/c² ), where v' is the velocity in S, u is the velocity of S' relative to S. Wait, no, I think I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me clarify.

In the Earth frame S, astronaut 1 is moving at u = +0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at v = +0.5c. We want to find the velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame (S'), which is moving at u = +0.6c relative to S.

So, the formula for the velocity in S' (v') is (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/c² ). Wait, yes, that's the formula. Because when you're transforming from S to S', which is moving at speed u relative to S, the velocity in S' is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So substituting the values, v = 0.5c, u = 0.6c.

So v' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute numerator first: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6 * 0.5 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.142857c. So the relative speed is 0.142857c, but since speed is a magnitude, it's 0.142857c. Wait, but the options have 0.14c, which is approximately that. So that's the relative speed.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So now I can narrow it down to C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the system consists of both astronauts. So the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies.

Each astronaut's energy is given by E = gamma * m c^2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) ) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 → 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) → 1/sqrt(0.75) → approx 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² → approximately 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 → 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C: E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: E=5mc^2. So that's about 5, which is less.

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc².

So looking back, the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

Calculating gamma for astronaut 1:

(0.6c)^2 is 0.36 c².

1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. That's correct.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2:

v=0.5c.

(0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)= (√3)/2≈0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.464 m c².

Sum: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈5.964, so about 5.96 mc². That's exactly what option C says.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but why is option D's energy 5 mc²? Did I make a mistake? Maybe I miscalculated the energies.

Wait, let me calculate 1.1547 *3.

1.1547 *3 = 3.4641, correct.

So 2.5 +3.4641=5.9641 mc².

Which is approximately 5.96 mc², so option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Part 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with speeds \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \) in the Earth frame. To find the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first astronaut's frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v' = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut in the Earth frame),
- \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut in the Earth frame).

Substituting the values:
\[
v' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \( 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c \),
2. **Denominator**: \( 1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \).

Thus:
\[
v' = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but speed is a magnitude. Therefore, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Part 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass \( m_1 = 2m \),
- Velocity \( v_1 = 0.6c \).

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass \( m_2 = 3m \),
- Velocity \( v_2 = 0.5c \).

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \),
- The total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.
