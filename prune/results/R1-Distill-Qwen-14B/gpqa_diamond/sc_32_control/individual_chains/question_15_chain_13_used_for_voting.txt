Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

So, the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the main thing is figuring out which one is more likely to transit, so the researchers should observe that one since they have limited time.

Wait, what determines the probability of a planet transiting? Oh right, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

I remember the probability formula. I think the probability P is approximately (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (a + R_star)), but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe it's more like (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) or something like that. Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing parameters.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So the formula I vaguely recall is P = (R_star / a)^2 * ...? Or perhaps it's (R_p + R_s)^2 over something else.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability formula is given by P = (R_s / a)^2 * (1/(1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ... No, wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. Oh wait, I'm confusing with the Doppler semi-amplitude formula.

I think the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the geometric probability factor. The geometric probability is roughly (R_s / a)², but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the geometric probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it transits. That's the main factor. The probability is R_s / a, scaled somehow. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look up (in my mind) the formula for the transit probability. Oh, right! The probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)², but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the geometric probability is (R_s / a). Because the planet has to pass in front, so the area where that can happen is a circle with diameter R_s, but the orbit is a much larger circle of radius a. So the probability is approximately (R_s / a)^2 * something.

Wait, no, wait. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits is given by the geometric probability. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_s / a)² multiplied by (R_p / R_s)^2, or is it (R_s / a) multiplied by (R_p / R_s)?

Wait, maybe the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)². Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)²? Or is it (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)²?

Wait, perhaps I should think geometrically. The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a. The area where a transit can occur is when the planet's position is within a circle of radius R_s (the star's radius) from our line of sight. The area of that circle is π R_s². The total area of possible positions (the orbit's cross-section) is π a². So the geometric probability is π R_s² / π a² = (R_s / a)². But wait, that can't be right because if R_s is much smaller than a, the probability would be small. But wait, that's correct. So the geometric probability is (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, then what about the planet's size? Because if the planet is larger relative to the star, it's more likely to block the star's light. Oh, no, the planet's size is already considered in another factor. Wait, no, the probability of a transit depends on the alignment (geometric factor) and the size of the planet relative to the star. Because if the planet is too small compared to the star, it's less likely that it will cause a noticeable transit.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / a ... Hmm, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think again.

I think the probability that a planet will transit is given by the geometric probability multiplied by the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius squared. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star. The probability depends on two factors: the planet's orbital plane being aligned such that it transits (geometric probability) and the size of the planet relative to the star.

The geometric probability is the chance that the planet's orbital inclination is such that it transits, which is (R_s / a), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the geometric probability isn't (R_s / a). I think it's (R_s / a) multiplied by the solid angle or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_s / a) squared.

Alternatively, the transit probability is calculated as (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)². But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by (R_p / R_s), but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should look for the standard formula. Oh, right! The probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)². Or perhaps it's (R_p + R_s) / (a) multiplied by something else. Hmm, no, perhaps the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)². Because the planet's size affects the depth of the transit (so that’s R_p² / R_s²), and the alignment is (R_s / a)².

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about each factor separately.

The geometric probability is the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. This depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the probability is (R_s / a)^2. Because the area where the transit can happen is a circle with radius R_s, and the area of the planet's orbit (from our perspective) is a circle of radius a. So the chance is (R_s/a)^2.

Wait, but that would mean that if R_s is small compared to a, the probability is low.

Yes, that makes sense. So the geometric probability is (R_s / a)^2.

But wait, I've read that the geometric probability for a transit is roughly (R_s / a). Because when you project the orbit, the distance from our line of sight is a, and the chance that the planet passes in front is determined by (R_s / a). So the probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by the fractional area blocked, which is (R_p / R_s)^2. So perhaps the total probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a).

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to find a source in my mind. Oh, right, the transit probability formula is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) because the area where the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_s, and the planet's orbit is a circle of radius a, so the probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, that would make the probability P = (R_p² / R_s²) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p²) / (R_s a).

Wait, that can't be right. Because units-wise, (R_p^2) / (R_s a) would be in (length)^2 / (length * length) ) = 1/length. Which doesn't make sense for a probability.

Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up factors. Let me think again. The transit probability has two components: 1) the chance that the orbital plane is aligned so that the planet passes in front of the star (geometric probability), and 2) the chance that the planet is large enough to cause a noticeable dip.

Wait, the geometric probability is the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits. The formula for that is (R_s / a).

Wait, let's think about the geometry. The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a around the star. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is such that it transits is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital radius. So the geometric probability is (R_s / a).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I think the geometric probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_s))², but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the geometric probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by (R_p / R_s)^2, but that would be the same as (R_p^2) / (a).

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the planet is very close to the star (a is small), so R_s/a is large. That would mean a higher transit probability. But if a is large, the probability is low. That makes sense.

Wait, but in our case, we have two planets. Let's see what variables we have.

Given:

- Both planets have the same mass.

- Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3.

- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

- Both stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star M. The formula is P² = (4π²/(G(M + m))) a³. Since the planets have much smaller mass than the stars, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² ∝ a³ / M.

So for Planet_1: P1² = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³.

For Planet_2: P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³.

Given that P1 = P2 /3, so (P2/3)^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³.

And P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³.

Divide the two equations:

[(P2/3)^2] / [P2²] = [ (4π²/(G M1)) a1³ ] / [ (4π²/(G M2)) a2³ ]

Simplify left side: (1/9) = [ (M2 a2³) / (M1 a1³) ]

Given M1 = 2 M2, substituting:

1/9 = ( M2 a2³ ) / ( 2 M2 a1³ )

Simplify:

1/9 = ( a2³ )/( 2 a1³ )

=> 2 a1³ = 9 a2³

=> a1³ = (9/2) a2³

=> a1 = a2 * (9/(2))^(1/3).

Let me compute (9/2)^1/3. 9/2 is 4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65. So a1 ≈ a2 * 1.65.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I might have expected. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period, but a higher mass star.

Wait, let me think again. Since P1 is shorter, and M1 is higher, let's see:

The formula P² ∝ a³ / M. So for a given a and M, a higher M leads to a shorter period. But Planet_1 has a shorter period, so either a is smaller or M is larger, or both.

In this case, M1 is 2 M2, so M is higher. Let's see what a1 is compared to a2.

From earlier calculation, a1 = a2 * (9/2)^1/3 ≈ 1.65 a2. So Planet_1 is farther from its star than Planet_2 is from its star.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive, but let me think. Because M1 is higher, for the same a, the period would be shorter than for a lower M. So if M1 is higher and P1 is shorter, perhaps a is larger? Let me recheck.

Wait, the equation after substitution was:

1/9 = (a2³)/(2 a1³)

=> 2 a1³ = 9 a2³

=> a1³ = (9/2) a2³

=> a1 = a2 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Which is approximately 1.65 a2. So a1 is larger than a2.

Hmm, so Planet_1 is orbiting farther away than Planet_2, despite having a shorter period. Because it's orbiting a more massive star.

Wait, that makes sense. Because a more massive star has stronger gravity. So for the same a, the period would be shorter. So if a1 is larger but M1 is twice as much, the period can be shorter.

Yes, I think that's correct.

Now, back to transit probability. So the geometric probability is (R_s / a)^2. Since both stars have the same radius, R_s is the same for both. So P_geo for each planet is (R_s / a)^2.

For Planet_1: P_geo1 = (R_s / a1)^2.

For Planet_2: P_geo2 = (R_s / a2)^2.

We found that a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 1.65 a2.

So P_geo1 = (R_s / (1.65 a2))^2 = (1/(1.65)^2) * (R_s / a2)^2.

Which is approximately (1/2.7225) * (R_s/a2)^2.

And P_geo2 is (R_s / a2)^2.

So P_geo2 is about 2.7225 times larger than P_geo1.

But wait, is that right? Because if a1 is larger, then (R_s/a1) is smaller, so P_geo1 is smaller than P_geo2.

So Planet_2 has a higher geometric probability.

But wait, that's just the geometric part. The other factor is the transit depth, which depends on (R_p / R_s)^2. But the question says both planets have the same mass. Wait, but mass doesn't directly translate to radius. However, the question says they are Earth-like. So perhaps we can assume that both planets have the same radius as Earth, R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

In that case, (R_p / R_s) is the same for both, so the transit depth is same. But the probability is the product of the geometric probability and the transit depth. Or wait, the transit depth is (R_p/R_s)^2, and the probability is the geometric factor.

Wait, but the probability of a transit occurring (i.e., the chance that we observe a transit given an observation) is the product of the geometric probability and the depth? Or is the depth part of the detectability, not the probability.

Hmm, perhaps the detectability (how easy it is to observe a transit) depends on the depth, but the actual probability that a transit occurs (i.e., the planet passes in front) is just the geometric probability.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The transit occurs if the planet's orbital plane is aligned, which is the geometric probability. The depth is how much the light is blocked, but that's separate from whether a transit occurs. So perhaps for the probability of a transit, it's just the geometric factor.

But the question is about which planet has a higher probability to transit, so which has a higher geometric probability.

So, in our case, Planet_2 has a smaller a (since a1 is 1.65 a2), so for Planet_2, a2 is smaller than a1, so (R_s / a) is larger, so P_geo is larger for Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, a1 is larger than a2. So (R_s/a1) is smaller than (R_s/a2). Therefore, P_geo for Planet_1 is (R_s/a1)^2, which is smaller than (R_s/a2)^2.

So Planet_2 has a higher geometric probability.

But the options suggest that one of them has higher probability. The options are A and B suggest Planet_2 is preferred, C and D suggest Planet_1.

So the probability for Planet_2's transit is higher, so the researchers should observe Planet_2.

Now, the question is, by how much?

We have a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 1.6506 a2.

So (a2/a1) = 1/1.6506 ≈ 0.605.

So (R_s/a1) = (R_s/a2) * 0.605.

So the geometric probability is proportional to (R_s/a)^2.

So P_geo2 / P_geo1 = ( (R_s/a2)^2 ) / ( (R_s/a1)^2 ) = (a1/a2)^2 = (1.6506)^2 ≈ 2.725.

So P_geo2 is about 2.725 times higher than P_geo1.

But wait, earlier I thought it was 2.7 times. So that's option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to 2.7 times. No, option D says Planet_1 is preferred, but our calculation says Planet_2 is preferred with about 2.7 times higher probability. So looking at the options:

Option A: ~2.25x higher for Planet_2.

Option B: ~1.5x higher.

Option C: ~1.65x higher for Planet_1.

Option D: ~2.7x higher for Planet_1.

Wait, no, options A and B say Planet_2 is preferred, with higher probabilities. Options C and D say Planet_1 is preferred.

Wait, from our calculation, P_geo2 is about 2.7 times higher than P_geo1. So, the probability for Planet_2 is higher, so they should choose to observe Planet_2, which would have a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.25 times higher for Planet_2, option B is 1.5 times higher.

But according to our calculation, the ratio is about 2.725, which is approximately 2.7 times. So none of the options for Planet_2 match that.

Wait, what's (9/2)^(1/3)? Let me compute that more accurately.

(9/2) = 4.5.

Cube root of 4.5. Let's compute 1.65^3: 1.65 *1.65=2.7225, *1.65: ~4.49. So 1.65^3 ≈4.49. So a1= a2 *1.65.

So (a1/a2)=1.65, so the ratio of P_geo2 to P_geo1 is (a1/a2)^2 = (1.65)^2 = 2.7225. So about 2.72 times.

So the geometric probability is about 2.72 times higher for Planet_2.

But in the options, the probabilities for Planet_2 being higher are in A (2.25), B (1.5). But none of them are 2.7. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express this.

We have P1 = P2/3.

From Kepler's third law, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M.

So for Planet_1: (P1)^2 = (a1^3) / (M1)

For Planet_2: (P2)^2 = (a2^3) / (M2)

Divide the two equations:

(P1^2)/(P2^2) = (a1^3 M2) / (a2^3 M1)

We have P1 = P2/3 → (P1/P2) = 1/3 → (P1^2)/(P2^2) = 1/9.

So,

1/9 = (a1^3 M2) / (a2^3 M1 )

We know M1 = 2 M2 → M2 = M1/2.

Substituting:

1/9 = ( a1^3 (M1/2) ) / ( a2^3 M1 )

Simplify:

1/9 = ( a1^3 (1/2) ) / a2^3

1/9 = (a1^3) / (2 a2^3 )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2^3:

(2/9) a2^3 = a1^3.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, let's redo this step.

Equation:

1/9 = (a1^3 * M2) / (a2^3 * M1 )

But M1 = 2 M2 → M2 = M1/2.

Substituting:

1/9 = (a1^3 * (M1/2)) / (a2^3 * M1 )

The M1 cancels out:

1/9 = (a1^3 * 1/2 ) / a2^3 → 1/9 = (a1^3) / (2 a2^3 )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2^3:

(2/9) a2^3 = a1^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Wait, that's different from before. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period, so if the star is more massive, the planet could be closer in.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the substitution.

Let me redo the substitution step.

Equation after substitution:

1/9 = (a1^3 * (M1/2)) / (a2^3 * M1 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (a1^3 * M1/2 ) / (a2^3 * M1 ) = (a1^3 / (2 a2^3 )).

So 1/9 = a1^3/(2 a2^3) → a1^3 = (2 a2^3)/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Which is approximately a2 * 0.606.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

That makes more sense. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period, so the semi-major axis is smaller. Because for a more massive star, the same semi-major axis would give a shorter period.

So now, let's recompute the geometric probability.

P_geo = (R_s / a)^2.

So for Planet_1: (R_s / a1)^2 = (R_s/(0.606 a2 ))^2 = (1/(0.606))^2 * (R_s/a2)^2.

(1/0.606) is approximately 1.6506.

So (1.6506)^2 ≈ 2.725.

So P_geo1 = 2.725 * (R_s/a2)^2.

P_geo2 is (R_s/a2)^2.

So P_geo1 is approximately 2.725 times P_geo2.

Wait, that can't be right because a1 is smaller than a2, so R_s/a1 is larger than R_s/a2 → P_geo1 is larger.

Wait, but if a1 is 0.606 a2, then R_s/a1 is (1/0.606) times (R_s/a2) → 1.65 times larger. So (R_s/a1)^2 is (1.65)^2 =2.72 times (R_s/a2)^2.

So geometric probability for Planet_1 is 2.72 times higher than that for Planet_2.

Ah! So earlier I messed up the substitution and got a1 larger than a2. But correcting that, a1 is smaller than a2, so Planet_1's geometric probability is higher.

So the conclusion is that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

So, the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

From our calculation, the geometric probability of Planet_1 is about 2.72 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, and the correct option is D.

Wait, but let's double-check.

Because the geometric probability is (R_s/a)^2.

If a1 is 0.606 a2, then (R_s/a1) is approx 1.65 times (R_s/a2).

So (R_s/a1)^2 is (1.65)^2=2.72 times (R_s/a2)^2.

So indeed, Planet_1's geometric probability is about 2.72 times higher.

So the probability ratio is approximately 2.7.

Which matches option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the geometric transit probability, which is proportional to \((R_s / a)^2\), where \(R_s\) is the star's radius and \(a\) is the planet's semi-major axis. Both planets orbit stars of the same radius, so the comparison depends on the ratio of their semi-major axes.

### Key Information:
1. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2 (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)).
2. **Star Masses**: The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).
3. **Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's Third Law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M\), we relate the semi-major axes of the two planets:
\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}.
\]
Substituting \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]
Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Calculating Geometric Transit Probability
The geometric transit probability is proportional to \((R_s / a)^2\). Since \(R_s\) is the same for both stars:
\[
\frac{P_{\text{geo,1}}}{P_{\text{geo,2}}} = \left(\frac{R_s / a_1}{R_s / a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2.
\]
Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\):
\[
\frac{P_{\text{geo,1}}}{P_{\text{geo,2}}} = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 1.65^2 \approx 2.72.
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.72 times the geometric transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher probability of transiting (~2.7 times) compared to Planet_2.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not ~1.5 times.
- **C)** Incorrect. While Planet_1 is preferred, the probability difference is not ~1.65 times.
- **D)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability difference is ~2.7 times.

Answer: D
