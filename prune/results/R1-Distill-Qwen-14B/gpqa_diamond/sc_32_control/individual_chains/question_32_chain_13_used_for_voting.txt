Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can work through this.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li typically has 3 protons. If there are 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the question is about the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy given to the particles is usually their kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes people refer to total energy as well. Hmm, I think in this case, since it's a collider, the energy would be the total relativistic energy of the nucleus, not just kinetic. Or wait, perhaps it's the kinetic energy? I'm a bit confused here. I'll have to think.

The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I need to calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus moving at this speed.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

Let me calculate gamma first. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96c)² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then, sqrt(0.0784) is... let's see, 0.0784 is about 0.28 squared because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Yeah, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so the sqrt is 0.28, so 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, the rest mass of the nucleus. So the nucleus is Li-6. The molar mass of Li is about 7 g/mol, but Li-6 is a stable isotope. Wait, the exact mass might matter, but since we're given options, perhaps we can approximate.

Wait, more accurately, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Because each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 u, so 6 nucleons make 6 u. One atomic mass unit is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u is 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 9.963e-27 kg.

But wait, more precisely, the atomic mass unit is 1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So for 6 u, it's 9.9632344e-27 kg.

So, m0 = 6 u = 9.963e-27 kg.

Now, the rest energy m0 c² is 9.963e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2. Let me compute that. 3e8 squared is 9e16. So 9.963e-27 * 9e16 = 8.9667e-10 J. Wait, but that's in joules. We need to convert that into GeV.

Wait, I know that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So how many eV is 8.9667e-10 J? Let's compute.

eV = J / (1.60218e-19) → 8.9667e-10 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 5.6e9 eV. That's 5.6 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

8.9667e-10 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = (8.9667 / 1.60218) * 1e9 eV ≈ 5.6 * 1e9 eV, which is 5.6 GeV.

So m0 c² ≈5.6 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second: that's the rest mass energy of the nucleus, which is 6 u. Does that make sense? Because a proton is about 0.938 GeV, so 6 protons would be 5.628 GeV. Oh yeah, that's about right. So 6 * 0.938 GeV is approximately 5.628 GeV. So our calculation makes sense.

So now, E = gamma * m0 c² ≈ 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.628.

Let me multiply 3.5 *5.6 is about 19.6, but let me get precise.

3.5714 *5.628:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.628 = let's compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284; 3.5714 *0.028= ~0.1000. So 2.14284+0.1000 = 2.24284.

So total is 17.857 +2.24284 ≈20.0998 GeV. So about 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but the options are B) 23.069, C) 20.132, D) 21.419. So 20.132 GeV is option C.

Hmm, but wait a second. Did I calculate gamma accurately? Let me double-check.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 ) → 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is indeed 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

So E = gamma * m0 c².

We have m0 c² ≈5.628 GeV.

3.5714 *5.628: Let me compute more accurately.

3.5714 *5.628.

Break it down:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857
3.5714 * 0.628: Let's compute 3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284, 3.5714*0.02=0.071428, 3.5714*0.008=0.0285712.

Adding those: 2.14284 +0.071428= 2.214268 +0.0285712= 2.2428392.

So total E=17.857 +2.2428392 = 20.0998 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.1 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close.

But wait, perhaps I approximated m0 c² too much. Let me compute m0 c² more precisely.

The exact mass of Li-6: Let me think. The standard atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512279 atomic mass units (u). Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I should be precise about the mass.

Wait, the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is given, but I might not know it offhand. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass is 6 u, which is 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Alternatively, maybe I can use the exact mass in u and compute m0 c² more accurately.

Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons: Li-6. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512279 u.

So 6.01512279 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u = let's compute that.

6.01512279 * 1.66053906660e-27 ≈ let's compute 6 * 1.6605e-27 =9.963e-27 kg. Then 0.01512279 *1.6605e-27 = approx 0.01512279 *1.6605e-27.

0.01 *1.6605e-27 =1.6605e-29, and 0.00512279*1.6605e-27 ≈8.49e-30. So total is about 1.6605e-29 +8.49e-30 = 2.5095e-29 kg.

Adding to 9.963e-27 kg: 9.963e-27 +2.5095e-29 = 9.963e-27 +0.025095e-27= 9.988095e-27 kg.

So m0 = 9.988095e-27 kg.

Then m0 c² is 9.988095e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

3e8 squared is 9e16 m²/s². Multiply by 9.988e-27 kg: 9.988e-27 *9e16 = 8.9892e-10 J.

Now, converting J to eV:

1 eV =1.60218e-19 J. So 8.9892e-10 J /1.60218e-19 J/eV = (8.9892 /1.60218) * 1e9 eV ≈5.608e9 eV →5.608 GeV.

So m0 c² ≈5.608 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 *5.608 GeV.

Compute 3.5 *5.608 = 19.628.

0.0714 *5.608 = 0.0714 *5 is 0.357, 0.0714 *0.608=0.0434. So total ≈0.357 +0.0434 ≈0.4004.

So total E≈19.628 +0.4004 ≈20.028 GeV.

Wait, but that's about 20.03 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma with more precision. Let me recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, since 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So that's correct.

So 3.57142857 *5.608 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

5.608 *3.57142857.

Let me break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142

0.008 *3.57142857=0.02857142856

Adding them together: 17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0 (exactly 20 because 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20.0, since 17.85714285 is 121/7, and 2.142857142 is 15/7. 121 +15=136 →136/7=19.42857? Wait no, wait 17.85714285 is 125/7, because 17*7=119, 119+6=125 →125/7≈17.85714285. 2.142857142 is 15/7. 125/7 +15/7=140/7=20. So 20 plus 0.02857142856 is 20.02857142856 GeV.

So E≈20.02857 GeV. Hmm, that's approximately 20.0286 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV. That's about 0.1 GeV difference. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the m0 c² calculation. Let me check that again.

Wait, earlier I used m0 =6.01512279 u.

Wait, 6.01512279 u is the exact mass of Li-6. So perhaps I should compute m0 c² more accurately.

Let me compute m0 =6.01512279 u.

Each u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m0=6.01512279 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute 6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

Now, 0.01512279 *1.6605390666e-27 = ?

Let me compute 0.01 *1.6605390666e-27=1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.00512279 *1.6605390666e-27 =?

0.005 *1.6605390666e-27 =8.302695333e-30 kg.

0.00012279 *1.6605390666e-27 =approx 2.032e-31 kg.

So total 0.01512279 u =1.6605390666e-29 +8.302695333e-30 +2.032e-31.

Wait, 1.660539e-29 is 16.60539e-30.

8.302695333e-30 is 8.302695333e-30.

Adding 16.60539e-30 +8.302695e-30 =24.908085e-30.

Plus 2.032e-31 (which is 0.2032e-30) → total 25.111285e-30 kg.

So m0 =6.01512279 u → 9.9632344e-27 kg (from 6u) + 25.111285e-30 kg (from 0.01512279 u) = 9.9632344e-27 +2.5111285e-29 kg.

Wait, 2.5111285e-29 is 0.025111285e-27, so total m0 = 9.9632344e-27 + 0.025111285e-27 =9.9883457e-27 kg.

So m0 c² =9.9883457e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So 9.9883457e-27 *9e16 = (9.9883457 *9) *1e-11 → 89.8951113 *1e-11 =8.98951113e-10 kg·m²/s² → joules.

Convert J to GeV.

1 eV =1.602176634e-19 J.

So 8.98951113e-10 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV = (8.98951113 /1.602176634) *1e9 eV.

Compute 8.9895 /1.602177 ≈5.608 GeV.

So m0 c² ≈5.608 GeV.

Thus, E=gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.608 ≈20.02857 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.02857, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma and m0 c².

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c → beta=0.96.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's exact.

Now m0 c²=6.01512279 u * (931.5 MeV/u) → because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c².

Ah, wait a minute! Oh, that's a much easier way to compute m0 c². Because I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c².

So, m0 c² =6.01512279 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01512279 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01512279 *931.5 = approx 14.05 MeV.

So total m0 c² ≈5589 +14.05 =5603.05 MeV →5.60305 GeV.

So m0 c²≈5.60305 GeV.

Then E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.60305 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60305.

Let me calculate it step by step.

3 *5.60305 =16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305.

Hmm, 0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305 ≈0.400496.

So 2.801525 +0.400496=3.202021.

So total E=16.80915 +3.202021=20.011171 GeV.

Approximately 20.011 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact value of 1 u.

Wait, more accurately, 1 u is 931.494065 MeV/c². Let's use that.

So m0 c²=6.01512279 u *931.494065 MeV/u.

So 6 *931.494065=5588.96439 MeV.

0.01512279 *931.494065 → let's compute.

0.01 *931.494065=9.31494065 MeV.

0.00512279 *931.494065 ≈4.767 MeV.

So total for 0.01512279 u is 9.31494 +4.767≈14.0819 MeV.

So m0 c²=5588.96439 +14.0819 ≈5603.046 MeV →5.603046 GeV.

So E=gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.603046 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.603046.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603046.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.003046 ≈0.010878.

So total 2.142857142 +0.010878 ≈2.153735.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153735 ≈20.010878 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0109 GeV.

But again, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this using more precise gamma.

Wait, I assumed gamma is exactly 3.57142857, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's recompute gamma with more precise beta.

Beta=0.96.

v=0.96c, so beta=0.96.

1 - beta²=1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's precise.

So no mistake there.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I used m0 as 6.01512279 u, but the exact value for Li-6 is needed.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01512279 u, but perhaps in reality, the atomic mass includes binding energy, but I think for the purpose of this problem, they just use the exact mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

If the energy is kinetic, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m0 c².

In that case, let's compute.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma -1 =2.57142857.

E_k =2.57142857 *5.603046 GeV.

Compute 2 *5.603046=11.206092.

0.57142857 *5.603046= let's compute.

0.5 *5.603046=2.801523.

0.07142857 *5.603046≈0.400496.

So 2.801523 +0.400496≈3.202019.

So E_k=11.206092 +3.202019≈14.408111 GeV.

But that's not matching any of the options. The options are all above 20 GeV.

So probably, the question refers to the total energy, not the kinetic. So back to E=gamma * m0 c² being 20.01 GeV, but the options have 20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the m0 calculation.

Wait, if the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass is 6.01512279 u, as I used. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

Gamma=1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )).

Compute 0.96^2 =0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

Now, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute it with more decimal places?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma with more precision.

Because 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216, so 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the energy in the center-of-mass frame or something else. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass is given as 6.000000 u, so m0 c²=6 *931.5 MeV=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589=?

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.089 *3.57142857≈0.31775514.

So 1.785714285 + 0.31775514≈2.1034694.

So E=17.85714285 +2.1034694=19.96061225 GeV.

Approximately 19.96 GeV, which is not one of the options either.

Wait, but the options include option B)23.069 GeV and D)21.419 GeV. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy is in a different unit, like per nucleon. No, the question says the speed of the nucleus X, so it's the nucleus as a whole.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately, including any possible rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise value for gamma.

Wait, let's compute gamma again.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784).

But wait, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm, so no mistake there.

Wait, maybe the mass is taken as 6.02 u or similar. Let me see.

If m0 is 6.02 u, then m0 c²=6.02 *931.5 MeV=5608.93 MeV=5.60893 GeV.

Then, E=3.57142857 *5.60893 GeV.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60893=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.00893 *3.57142857≈0.03193.

So 2.142857142 +0.03193=2.174787.

So E=17.85714285 +2.174787≈20.03193 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0319 GeV. Still not matching any option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the kinetic energy, but the options are higher than our calculation. Let's think: E_kinetic= (gamma -1)*m0 c².

Using m0 c²=5.60893 GeV, gamma=3.57142857.

gamma-1=2.57142857.

E_k=2.57142857 *5.60893 ≈14.41 GeV.

But that's much lower than the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total energy of the collider, which might involve two beams colliding. Oh, wait! In colliders, such as RHIC, it's a collider where two beams are moving in opposite directions. So each beam has energy E, and the total center-of-mass energy would be higher. But wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC" when the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps it's the energy per beam.

Wait, in colliders, the energy per beam is E, and the total energy in the center of mass is higher. But the question specifically asks for the energy of RHIC for the nucleus speed of 0.96c. So probably, it's the energy per beam, which is the E we were calculating earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as moving at 0.96c, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the gamma.

Wait, let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the speed is given as a fraction of c, but perhaps I should calculate gamma with more precise decimal places.

Wait, 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) using more precise calculation.

Wait, let me compute 1/(sqrt(0.0784)) exactly. Since 0.0784 is 0.28^2, so sqrt is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So no mistake there.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute m0 c² using more precise 931.494 MeV/u.

So m0 c² =6.01512279 *931.494 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.01512279 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494=9.31494 MeV.

0.00512279 *931.494 ≈4.76 MeV.

So total m0 c²=5588.964 +9.31494 +4.76≈5603.0389 MeV=5.6030389 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6030389 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6030389=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0030389 *3.57142857≈0.010865.

So 2.142857142 +0.010865=2.153722.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.153722=20.01086485 GeV.

Hmm, so around 20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor due to the binding energy or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, but the rest mass is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6, but maybe the mass is taken as 6.0 nucleons, so 6 u, leading to m0 c²=5.589 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.589=approx 20.03 GeV. Still no.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the rest mass and calculate using gamma * m0 c², but perhaps the rest mass is 6 *0.938 GeV (since each proton/neutron is ~0.938 GeV), but that would give m0 c²=6 *0.938=5.628 GeV, which is what I used earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total energy of the nucleus, which is correct, but perhaps the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate 3.57142857 *5.603046.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603046.

Let me break it down:

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.003046 *3.57142857≈ approx 0.010878.

So 2.142857142 +0.010878=2.153735.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.153735=20.010877 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using c=3e8 m/s, and m0 for Li-6 is 6.01512279 u, but perhaps the value of the Planck constant or other constants is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma using more precise beta.

Beta=0.96.

Compute gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta²)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

No, that's exact.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma using the formula gamma = (1 - beta^2)^-0.5.

Beta=0.96.

Beta squared is 0.9216.

So 1 - beta^2=0.0784.

Square root is 0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact value of gamma= 3.57142857.

Then, using m0 c²=5.6030389 GeV, E=3.57142857 *5.6030389.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030389.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.6030389:

= (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) ×5.6030389

Compute 3 ×5.6030389 =16.8091167.

0.5 ×5.6030389=2.80151945.

0.07142857 ×5.6030389 ≈0.400497.

Add them:

16.8091167 +2.80151945 =19.61063615.

19.61063615 +0.400497=20.01113315 GeV.

So E≈20.0111 GeV.

But the only option near this is option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01512279 u, which is about 6.01512279 ×931.494 MeV=6.01512279 ×931.494=?

Compute:

6 ×931.494=5588.964.

0.01512279 ×931.494= approx 14.085 MeV.

So m0 c²=5588.964 +14.085=5603.049 MeV=5.603049 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.603049.

Compute:

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.603049=?

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.003049 ×3.57142857≈0.01089.

So 2.142857142 +0.01089≈2.153747.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.153747=20.01089 GeV.

Still about 20.0109 GeV. No option matches.

Wait, perhaps the initial miscalculation is in the unit conversion.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the energy in a different unit, but the options are all in GeV, so that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but that gives about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as a fraction of c, but I used 0.96c correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise value of c or other constants.

Wait, the speed is 0.96c, so v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=3.57142857.

m0=6.01512279 u.

m0 c²=6.01512279 ×931.494 MeV=5.603049 GeV.

E=gamma × m0 c²=3.57142857 ×5.603049=20.01089 GeV.

Hmm.

The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

The closest is C)20.132, which is 0.121 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation, but I don't see where.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use gamma multiplied by (m0 c²). But that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving in a certain direction and the energy is measured differently, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula E² = (pc)² + (m0 c²)^2, but since we know v, we can find p and then E. But that would lead to the same result as the gamma approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass energy per nucleon.

Wait, but no, the nucleus's total energy is what matters.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact value of gamma, perhaps using the extended decimal places.

Wait, gamma=3.5714285714285714...

So, perhaps, using more precise m0 c².

m0 c²=6.01512279 ×931.494065 MeV.

Compute:

6 ×931.494065=5588.96439 MeV.

0.01512279 ×931.494065= let's compute.

0.01 ×931.494065=9.31494065 MeV.

0.00512279 ×931.494065= approximately 4.767 MeV.

So total 9.31494065 +4.767=14.08194065 MeV.

So m0 c²=5588.96439 +14.08194065=5603.04633 MeV=5.60304633 GeV.

So E=3.5714285714285714 ×5.60304633.

Compute:

3.5714285714285714 ×5=17.857142857142856.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.60304633=?

Let me compute 3.5714285714285714 ×0.6=2.1428571428571425.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.00304633≈0.01088.

So 2.1428571428571425 +0.01088=2.1537371428571425.

Total E=17.857142857142856 +2.1537371428571425=20.01088 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but my calculations are leading to about 20.01 GeV. There's a discrepancy of about 0.12 GeV.

Wait, maybe I should compute using more accurate values for gamma and m0 c².

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise beta.

Wait, let's compute gamma using beta=0.96.

gamma=1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2 )).

Alternatively, using the formula gamma = (1 - beta^2 )^(-0.5).

But since beta is exactly 0.96, the calculation is precise.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact value of 0.96^2, which is 0.9216, leading to gamma=3.57142857.

But no, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the approximation gamma ≈27 for v=0.998c, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should check another approach: calculate the total energy E=gamma * m0 c².

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is a heavy ion, and perhaps the rest mass is negligible, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula E = (m0 c²) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Which is the same as gamma * m0 c².

So that's correct.

Hmm.

I'm a bit stuck here. My calculation keeps leading me to about 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute gamma with more precise steps.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

m0 c²=6.01512279 u ×931.494 MeV/u=5.603049 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.603049.

Hmm.

Let me compute this product more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.603049.

Let me write it as (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) ×5.603049.

3 ×5.603049=16.809147.

0.5 ×5.603049=2.8015245.

0.07142857 ×5.603049≈approx 0.07142857 ×5.6=0.400496, plus 0.07142857 ×0.003049≈0.000218, so total≈0.400714.

So adding all: 16.809147 +2.8015245=19.6106715 +0.400714=20.0113855 GeV.

So E≈20.0113855 GeV.

Hmm, still around 20.01 GeV.

Wait, the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

The closest is C)20.132, which is 0.1206 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the velocity. If the velocity were 0.98c, gamma would be higher.

Wait, let me check. Let's compute gamma for v=0.98c.

v=0.98c → beta=0.98.

beta squared=0.9604.

1 - beta squared=0.0396.

sqrt(0.0396)=0.199.

gamma=1/0.199≈5.0251.

Then E=5.0251 *5.603049≈28.17 GeV. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity is 0.99c.

gamma=7.0888.

E=7.0888 *5.603≈39.7 GeV. Not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy in a different way, but I can't think of another approach.

Hmm.

Given all that, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but according to my calculations, it's approximately 20.01 GeV, which is not among the options. But I must choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong mass number. Wait, Li with 3 neutrons is Li-6, right? Because Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons → 6 nucleons.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the charge, but no, the mass is based on nucleons.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but due to more precise calculation, it's slightly higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.603049 using more precise steps.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.603049.

Let me set it up as:

3.57142857
×5.603049
------------

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply 3.57142857 by 5.603049.

But this would take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach.

But since I don't have a calculator, let me approximate.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.603049.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.603049 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.003049=0.0108906.

So 2.142857142 +0.0108906=2.153747742.

Adding to 17.85714285:17.85714285 +2.153747742=20.01089059 GeV.

Yes, about 20.0109 GeV.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why there's this discrepancy.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed, like 0.98c or 0.95c, but the question states 0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6.000000 u, leading to m0 c²=5.589 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.589=19.96 GeV.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass energy as 6 ×938 MeV (proton mass) →5.628 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.628=20.099 GeV.

Hmm, 20.099 GeV is about 20.1 GeV, which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Ah! Maybe that's it. The problem approximates the rest mass energy as 6 ×0.938 GeV =5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

Compute:

3 ×5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 ×5.628= approx 3.208 GeV.

So total E=16.884 +3.208=20.092 GeV.

Which is about 20.092 GeV. Close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses 6 ×0.931 GeV=5.586 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.586=20.03 GeV.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps the gamma is calculated as 3.57142857, and m0 c² is 5.628 GeV, leading to E=3.57142857 ×5.628=20.099 GeV.

Which is about 20.1 GeV.

So given the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done using more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.628=?

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.028 ×3.57142857=0.09999999996.

Total 2.142857142 +0.09999999996=2.242857142.

So E=17.85714285 +2.242857142=20.1 GeV.

Ah, that's exactly 20.1 GeV.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but due to rounding during calculations, it's about 20.1 GeV.

So the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) moves at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus X is Li-6, which has a mass of \( 6.01512279 \, u \), where \( u \) is the atomic mass unit. Using the conversion \( 1 \, u = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.01512279 \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5603.05 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Substituting \( \gamma \) and \( m_0 c^2 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857
\]
\[
3.5714 \times 0.60305 \approx 2.154
\]
\[
E = 17.857 + 2.154 \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which likely accounts for slight rounding differences in intermediate steps or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
