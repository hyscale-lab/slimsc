Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again carefully.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. When a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are given as A to D, with values 35, 25, 31, 29.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, let's tackle the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests maybe a strong acid and a carbonate, but more likely something like a metal reacting with acid. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal and Y is an acid, but not necessarily.

Gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule of W has equal numbers of each. Since protons are the atomic number and neutrons are the difference from the mass number, a molecule where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons? Or perhaps a molecule where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons... Wait, but it's the molecule of W that has same number of neutrons and protons. Maybe the molecule is something like H2O, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, let's think about possible gases. Common gases released in reactions are H2, O2, CO2, SO2, NH3, etc. Let's see:

- H2: Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons (since hydrogen is lightest isotope). So each H has 1p and 0n. The molecule has 2 H atoms, so total protons:2, neutrons:0. Not equal.
- O2: Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So molecule has 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So yes, same number. That fits. So W could be O2?
Wait, but when you have a reaction between a metal and acid, you usually get H2 gas, not O2. Unless it's a very vigorous reaction, but that's less common.

Another possibility: CO2. Each molecule has 22 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 8*2 = 22). Neutrons: for C-12, 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8 each. So 6 + (8*2) = 6 + 16 = 22 neutrons. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits as well.

Wait, then W could be CO2. Similarly, maybe another gas. Let's keep that in mind.

Then, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. What's 277 K in Celsius? 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C, so around 4°C. But melting point of B is near that? Let me think about substances with melting points around 3-4°C. Water freezes at 0°C, but perhaps another solid, like maybe ammonium nitrate? No, that's a solid with a higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe something else. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above the freezing point of water. What about something like B being a solid that's close to melting at that temperature.

Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Let me think about possible B candidates.

Wait, when G is heated, it releases B. So G is a precipitate, perhaps a carbonate or something else. Let's think about a common reaction where a precipitate forms and upon heating releases a gas. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating might decompose it into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then, B would be the metal oxide. I'm not sure if that fits the melting point, though.

Alternatively, think about a reaction between a metal and an acid. If X is a metal, Y could be an acid. The reaction produces H2 gas. But earlier I thought W was O2 or CO2, but maybe H2 is the gas. Let's reconsider that.

If W is H2, then each H atom has 1p and 0n, so the molecule has 2p and 0n. So H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not same number. So that doesn't fit. So maybe W isn't H2.

Another possible gas is O2, as I thought before. That fits the condition. So when X reacts with Y, O2 is released. But then, what reactions produce O2? Decomposition of peroxides, but that's less common. Maybe a reaction where a peroxide is involved, but that's not typical for metals and acids.

Wait, perhaps Y is a peroxide, and X is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a strong oxidizing acid, producing O2.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So when a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. What's a common reagent used in organic chemistry that reacts with acids?

Ah, maybe X is a strong base like NaOH or KOH. Wait, but those are hydroxides. When a carboxylic acid reacts with a base, it forms a salt and water. The product would be the conjugate base of the acid. For example, if the acid is RCOOH, then the product would be RCOO^- Na^+ (if X is NaOH). But then, the product would have more oxygen atoms, but the question says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like LiAlH4, a strong reducing agent. If a keto acid (like a ketone) reacts with X, perhaps a reduction occurs. But I'm not sure how that would give a product with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, another thought: X could be a hydride. For example, NaBH4 or LiAlH4. These are used in organic reactions to reduce carbonyl groups. But then, when a keto acid (like a ketone) reacts with a hydride, it would form an alcohol. The product (the alcohol) would have more oxygen atoms than the starting ketone. But the question says the product contains two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is esterification or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction of X with the keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is an ether or something. Alternatively, the product is a carbonate or similar.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is with a base. Let me think: when a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) reacts with a base like NaOH, it forms a salt (RCOO^- Na^+) and water. The product would have more oxygen, but perhaps if the acid is a keto acid, like a ketone, but wait, no, ketones don't react with bases in the same way.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Let's think about the product having two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a diol (two -OH groups), but that would have more than two O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an ester. Wait, but in esterification, you typically have an acid and an alcohol. But X is a reagent, not necessarily an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. For example, when a diol is treated with an acid catalyst, it forms an ether and water. But I'm not sure how that ties into the current problem.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try another angle.

The question says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So the product has two O atoms. Let's think about possible products. Maybe the keto acid is being reduced. For example, a ketone (like acetone) reacting with X (a reducing agent) would become an alcohol. Acetone (propanone) has three oxygen atoms. If it's reduced to propanol, which has one O (in the OH group) but I'm not sure. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. When reduced, it becomes (CH3)2CHOH, which has two O atoms. Wait, no: acetone has one O, and the product would have one O as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination, but that's unclear.

Let me think about other possibilities. What if X is a strong base like NaOH? Suppose the keto acid is a ketone. Then, perhaps the reaction is not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe X is something like PCl5 or another chlorinating agent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and when it reacts with the keto acid, it produces a salt with a certain number of oxygen atoms. For example, if the acid is H2SO4 (but that's not a keto acid). Wait, maybe the acid is like a carboxylic acid. If X is a metal, like Mg, then the reaction would produce Mg salt and H2 gas.

But the key point is that the product has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a carbonate or something similar. Wait, but that's getting me a bit stuck.

Let me think about the first part again. W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. If W is CO2, each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons (assuming C-12 and O-16). So that fits.

So W is CO2. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2.

What reactions produce CO2? Combustion, decomposition of carbonates, or reactions between acids and carbonates.

Wait, if Y is a carbonate (like Na2CO3), and X is a strong acid (like H2SO4), then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and the corresponding sulfate. But then, what would precipitate? If Y is a carbonate and X is an acid, the reaction is:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

But in that case, there's no precipitate if all the products are soluble. Wait, unless Y is something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is a nitrate or another salt that forms an insoluble product.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal. For example, if X is Ca, and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce CaCl2, H2 gas, and no CO2. So that's not matching.

Wait, but if Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid, then CO2 is released. But the reaction would be acid + carbonate → CO2, water, and the corresponding acid's salt. But whether a precipitate forms depends on the solubility.

Alternatively, if Y is a hydroxide, but that doesn't produce CO2.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal and Y is a carbonate. So the reaction would be metal + carbonate → metal carbonate + CO2? Not sure.

Alternatively, X is a metal, and Y is a carbonate solution. So the reaction would be:

2 Na2CO3 + 2 H2SO4 → 2 Na2SO4 + 2 H2O + 2 CO2↑.

Again, no precipitate if all products are soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. But then the precipitate might be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CaCO3, but that's a solid, and when reacted with HCl, it produces CO2, CaCl2, and water. But then, no precipitate because CaCl2 is soluble.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's think about G, the precipitate. Then, when heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K (4°C). So B is a solid that melts around that temperature.

What's a solid that melts around 4°C? Well, water ice melts at 0°C, but maybe something else. Wait, maybe ammonium nitrate? The melting point of ammonium nitrate is about 169°C, which is much higher. Alternatively, maybe a different substance. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. For example, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2. But CaO has a melting point around 2570°C, way higher than 4°C. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes when heated to produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The melting point of Na2CO3 is around 854°C, which is way higher than 4°C. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Let me think of other materials. What about a solid with a low melting point. For example, maybe B is a type of salt that's solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C. Wait, sodium hydroxide's melting point is around 1390°C. That's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is not a pure element but a compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium nitrate has a melting point of about 32.4°C, but that's still higher than 4°C.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different substance entirely. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, so maybe B is something like ammonium chloride, which has a melting point of around 334 K (61°C). No, that's still higher.

Hmm, I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about possible reactions. The precipitate G could be a carbonate, but upon heating, it gives B, which has a low melting point. Alternatively, G could be a hydroxide. For example, maybe a metal hydroxide precipitates, and upon heating, it loses water to form an oxide. But that would require the oxide to have a low melting point. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfate. But sulfates are usually soluble, except for some like BaSO4. If Y is a sulfate and X is a metal with low solubility, then G would precipitate. When heated, perhaps it decomposes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe G isn't a carbonate but another salt. Let me think: if the reaction is between X (a metal) and Y (a salt solution), perhaps a double displacement reaction occurs, forming a precipitate. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl, then AgCl precipitates. But then heating AgCl doesn't release anything; it's stable. So that's not fitting.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to consider W as CO2. So:

Reaction: X + Y → G (precipitate) + CO2↑ + ?

If X is a carbonate, then Y would be an acid. But that would produce CO2, but then Y would be something like HCl. But then, the precipitate might be something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. Let's say X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. The reaction produces CO2, NaCl, and H2O. Since all are soluble, no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a carbonate. But I'm not seeing it.

Another approach: Let's think about the elements in Substance X. The question mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X contains at least two isotopes, but in its structure, one of the elements has a heavier isotope. So X is probably a molecule or compound where one of its elements has a heavier isotope.

Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like DMSO (which is (CH3)2SO), but isotopic substitution could be like deuterated compounds. For example, if X is CDCl3, a deuterated chloroform. But then, looking at the reaction.

Wait, but if X is a chlorinated compound, reacting with a liquid Y could produce HCl and maybe CO2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but I don't see how that would produce CO2.

Wait, another thought: what if X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a stronger acid. For example, CaCO3 reacting with HCl would produce CO2, but no precipitate if all products are soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, and X is a metal with low reactivity. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a hydroxide. Hmm, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the decomposition of a carbonate. For example, when a carbonate is treated with a strong acid, it produces CO2 and water, along with the corresponding salt. But I'm not seeing how this would produce a precipitate unless the salt is insoluble.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a sulfide. For example, if X is a metal, and Y is a solution of a sulfide, then the reaction might produce a precipitate of a less soluble sulfide. But then, the gas W would be H2S, which has 18 protons (S has 16, each H has 1) and neutrons: H has 0 each, S-32 has 16 neutrons. So each molecule of H2S has 18 protons and 16 neutrons. So that doesn't fit the condition of same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but if W is CO2, which we thought earlier, then each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. So W is CO2.

So reaction: X + Y → G (precipitate) + CO2↑ + ?

Perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, but no precipitate. So maybe X is a metal and Y is a carbonate solution.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal, Y is a carbonate solution. So the reaction would be:

Metal + carbonate → metal carbonate + CO2↑ ?

But that would require the metal carbonate to be insoluble, forming a precipitate.

For example, if X is Ba, and Y is Na2CO3 solution. Then, the reaction would be:

Ba + Na2CO3 → BaCO3↓ + Na2 (but that's not correct stoichiometry). Wait, correct reaction would be:

Ba(NO3)2 (solution) + Na2CO3 → BaCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3.

So if X is Ba(NO3)2, Y is Na2CO3, then G is BaCO3 precipitate. Upon heating BaCO3, it decomposes into BaO and CO2. But BaO's melting point is around 1500°C, not 4°C. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, if G is CaCO3, heating it would produce CaO and CO2. But as before, melting points don't fit.

Wait, perhaps G is not a carbonate but another compound. Let's think: if W is CO2, then the reaction produces CO2. So X and Y could be a carbonate and an acid, but then the precipitate is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a solution of a metal that forms an insoluble carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction between a sulfite and an acid, producing SO2 gas. But earlier analysis shows that doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition.

Wait, maybe W is NO. The molecule NO has 7 protons and 8 neutrons (N has 7p, 7n; O has 8p, 8n). So each NO molecule has 15 protons and 15 neutrons? Wait, no, wait, the molecule NO has (7+8) =15 protons, and (7 +8)=15 neutrons? No, wait, the molecule's protons are sum of all atoms, same with neutrons.

Wait, NO molecule has one N and one O atom. So N has 7p, 0 neutrons (if it's N-14, which has 7p and 7n). O has 8p, 8n (O-16). So total protons in NO:7 +8 =15. Neutrons:7 (from N) +8 (from O) =15. So yes, 15 each. That fits the condition. So W could be NO gas.

But the reaction producing NO would involve perhaps a metal reacting with a nitric acid, but I'm not sure. Also, NO is a toxic gas, but possible.

But I'm not certain. Let me think: when a metal reacts with concentrated nitric acid, it can produce NO3, NO2, or NO depending on the conditions. So maybe that's the case here.

If W is NO, then the reaction between X (a metal) and Y (HNO3) produces NO gas, along with a precipitate.

Then, the precipitate G, upon heating, releases B, which has a melting point near 4°C.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the precipitate here. When metal reacts with nitric acid, it usually forms a nitrate salt, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Unless the metal's nitrate is insoluble. For example, if the metal is Ag, AgNO3 is soluble, so no precipitate. Perhaps if the metal nitrate is insoluble, but I can't think of any common ones.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is a metal. Then, the reaction would produce CO2, but I'm still stuck.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the isotopic part. The problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element where at least one atom has a heavier isotope. Common elements with isotopes include carbon (like C-12, C-13, C-14), chlorine (Cl-35, Cl-37), etc.

Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include CH3COOH, CH3CH2OH, DMSO, etc. But isotopes are often used in specific cases, like deuterated compounds. For example, D2O is heavy water. Or perhaps X is something like CDCl3, which is a common solvent in NMR.

Wait, CDCl3 is chloroform with a deuterium. So the elements in X would be C, D (deuterium, which is H-2), and Cl. The lightest element would be D (mass 2), and the heaviest would be Cl (mass 35 or 37, depending on isotope). But wait, if X has Cl, then the heaviest element would be Cl (35 or 37). So the cumulative atomic mass would be 2 (D) + 35 (Cl) = 37. But the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So 37 isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements in X are C and H. But then, the heavier isotope would be something like C-13 or C-14. But if X is a compound with both C and H, and perhaps another element.

Wait, considering that when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetone (propan-2-one). If X is a reducing agent like NaBH4, the reaction would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. Acetone (CH3)2CO → (CH3)2CHOH. The product has two O atoms (the OH has one, and another from where?), wait, no. Acetone has one O, the product has one O as well. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, if the keto acid is a carboxylic acid, and X is an alcohol, but that would involve esterification, which typically requires acid catalysts. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product of the reaction has two O atoms. So, possible functional groups with two O atoms include esters, ethers, or amides. But considering X is a reagent, perhaps it's something like PCl5, which converts carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides. But then, the product would have more O atoms.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent, causing the loss of water. For example, if the keto acid is a diol, and X is PCl5, then the diol would form an ether, losing HCl and H2O. The product would have two O atoms. Let me think: diol (HO-R-OH) + PCl5 → R-O-R + HCl and POCl3 or similar. So the product is an ether with two O atoms. But that's getting into more complex territory.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like SOCl2, which converts carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides. But that would introduce Cl and O, but I'm not sure about the O count.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if X is a halogen and the keto acid is an alcohol, but that may not fit.

Wait, maybe the product has two O atoms because it's a carbonate. If X is a carbonate and the reaction produces a carbonate salt, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ether, which has two O atoms. So if the reaction is between an alcohol and X, which is a dehydrating agent, forming an ether. But then, the product would have two O atoms in the ether group.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about X's elements.

If X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but I don't see how that would fit. Alternatively, X could be something like NaOH. But then, when NaOH reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone), it doesn't do much unless it's under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, and when it reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone), it doesn't react directly, but perhaps under certain conditions. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent like LiAlH4. When it reacts with a ketone, it reduces the ketone group to an alcohol. So the product would have an -OH group, but how many O atoms?

Wait, acetone (propan-2-one) has one O. When reduced, it becomes propan-2-ol, which has one O. So the product would have one O atom, not two. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the keto acid is something like RCO-O-R (an ester), but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is an amide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or acetal, which have two O atoms. But I'm not sure how X would facilitate that.

Hmm. Let's try to think of X as a reagent used in organic chemistry that contains a heavy isotope. One such reagent is D2O (deuterated water), which is used in NMR to exchange protons with deuterium. Another is CDCl3 (chloroform, CCl3D), which is a common solvent.

So if X is CDCl3, what would happen when it reacts with a keto acid? Wait, CDCl3 is a solvent, not a reactant. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CH3OD (methanol with deuterium), but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with a heavy isotope like deuterium. So, if X is CH3COOD (deuterated acetic acid), and when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it does an exchange. But I'm not certain about the product having two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), which is used in organic reactions as a base. So when it reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), it would form the sodium salt and CO2 gas. But that doesn't seem to fit the product having two O atoms.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the options provided. The options are 25,29,31,35. These are all atomic mass numbers. So the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. 

Looking at the options:

A)35 → could be Cl (35.5) and another element.

B)25 → maybe Mg (24.3) and another.

C)31 → maybe Ar (39.9) and something else? Not sure.

D)29 → maybe Si (28) and F (19), but 28+19=47, which doesn't match 29.

Wait, perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X are H and Cl. So H has an atomic mass of 1 (lightest), Cl has 35.5 (heaviest). Sum would be 36.5, which rounds to 35? Option A is 35.

But why would X have H and Cl? Let's think: X could be something like HCl (hydrochloric acid), but HCl is a liquid, and Y would be a metal or carbonate. Alternatively, X could be something like CH3Cl, but that's a chlorinated compound.

Wait, but earlier I thought about X being a reagent like DMSO, which is (CH3)2SO. So the elements are C, H, S, O. The lightest is H (1), the heaviest is S (32.07). So sum would be 1 +32=33. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if X is something like NH4Cl (ammonium chloride), which is used in organic reactions. The elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is approximately 35. Option A.

So that could fit. Let me check.

If X is NH4Cl, then:

- NH4Cl reacts with Y (maybe a carbonate or hydroxide) to produce what? Hmm, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, and the reaction is:

NH4Cl + Na2CO3 → NH4CO3 + NaCl.

But that's a double displacement, producing NH4CO3 and NaCl. If NH4CO3 is insoluble, it would precipitate as G. Then, heating NH4CO3 would decompose into NH3, CO2, and H2O. The product B would be a solid, perhaps, but I'm not sure about its melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope. Wait, but X has a heavier isotope, so it must have at least two isotopes. Cl has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37, so if X contains Cl, that fits.

If X is NH4Cl, then when it reacts with a keto acid (like H2O?), I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think about the reaction with Y. If X is NH4Cl, and Y is NaOH, then the reaction would produce NH3, H2O, and NaCl. But that doesn't produce CO2.

Wait, but earlier I thought W is CO2. So unless Y is a carbonate, perhaps X is a carbonate. But then I'm back to square one.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate). When it reacts with an acid, it produces CO2, H2O, and the corresponding salt. For example:

NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, the precipitate G would be NaCl, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe Y is not an acid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and X is a metal that displaces the carbonate, producing CO2.

For example, if X is Fe and Y is Na2CO3 solution, the reaction might not proceed because Fe is more reactive than Na, but perhaps under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate solution to produce CO2 and a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to look for the options and see which makes sense.

The options are 35,25,31,29.

If X has H and Cl as its lightest and heaviest elements, sum is about 35 (option A).

But I'm not certain. Another possibility: X is NaOH. Lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which is close to option B (25). But perhaps considering isotopes, Na has a heavier isotope, like Na-24 or Na-25. If X contains Na-25, then the mass would be 25 for Na, plus H (1) → sum 26, which is close to option B (25). But the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is NaOH, and it's using Na-25, then the sum is 25 (Na) + 1 (H) =26, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if X is CaCO3, then the elements are C, Ca, and O. Lightest is C (12) or O (16)? Wait, no, the lightest is C (12), heaviest is Ca (40). Sum is 52, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Another approach: think about the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 35,25,31,29. So for each option, what elements sum to that.

Option A:35 → perhaps 35 = 1 (H) + 34 (Se), but that's not a common combination. Or 35 = 16 (O) + 19 (F). Alternatively, 35 could be 12 (C) + 23 (Na) =35. So if X contains C and Na, sum is 35. So which reagent in organic chemistry contains sodium and carbon? Maybe NaHCO3, but that's a bicarbonate. Or maybe sodium acetate, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope necessarily.

Wait, but X is used as a reagent and incorporates a heavier isotope. So, for example, if X is NaOH and it has Cl as a substituent, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl. But NaCl is a salt, not a reagent in organic reactions, but sometimes used.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with Na and O. For example, NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite). The elements are Na, O, Cl. Lightest is O (16), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum would be 16 +35.5 =51.5 → not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me summarize:

- W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons → CO2 or NO.

- G is a precipitate that upon heating releases B, with melting point ~4°C.

- X is used in organic chemistry, has a heavier isotope.

- Reaction of X with a keto acid yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.

If I'm stuck, maybe I should guess based on the options. The options are 35,25,31,29.

If X is CDCl3, then the elements are C, D, Cl. The lightest is D (2), heaviest Cl (35). Sum 37. Not an option.

If X is NaOH, lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Closest option is B (25). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is something like NH4Cl, the elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35). Sum 36. Closest option is A (35). Maybe the sum is approximated without decimal points.

So perhaps the answer is A)35.

Wait, but earlier I thought about W being CO2, which would suggest that X and Y's reaction produces CO2. If X is a carbonate, then Y would be an acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. The reaction produces CO2 and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates as G. Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into B and CO2. But B's melting point is 4°C, which is very low. So what solid has a melting point near 4°C?

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 277 K (4°C). Wait, that sounds promising.

Wait, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point of about 277 K (4°C). So B could be the anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which is formed when the decahydrate is heated. Wait, no, when you heat the decahydrate, you lose water and get the anhydrous form. But the anhydrous Na2CO3 has a much higher melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps G is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), which upon heating decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The melting point of Na2CO3 is higher, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but if B is the product when G is heated, and G is the decahydrate, then upon heating, it loses water and becomes the anhydrous form. The melting point of the decahydrate is around 277 K, so maybe B is the anhydrous form, but that doesn't fit because its melting point is much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps B is the water of crystallization, but that's a liquid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too stuck. Based on the options and the earlier reasoning, I think the correct answer is 35 (option A), as it fits the sum of H and Cl isotopes in a compound like NaCl or NH4Cl, which are used as reagents.

The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, given its properties and reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with Liquid Y**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. A plausible candidate for W is CO₂, as each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. This suggests that X and Y could involve a carbonate and an acid, or a metal and a carbonate.

2. **Precipitate G and Heating**: The reaction forms a precipitate G, which releases B upon heating. B has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). This suggests that B could be a compound with a low melting point, such as sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na₂CO₃·10H₂O), which has a melting point near 277 K.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies that X could be a reagent like NH₄Cl or NaOH, which reacts with keto acids to form products with specific oxygen counts.

4. **Isotopic Composition of X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. For example, chlorine (Cl) has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37, making it a candidate for X if X contains chlorine.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Mass Calculation**: The lightest and heaviest elements in X are considered. If X contains hydrogen (H) and chlorine (Cl), the lightest element has an atomic mass of 1 (H), and the heaviest has an atomic mass of approximately 35 (Cl). The cumulative atomic mass is 1 + 35 = 36, which aligns closely with option A (35).

Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are best represented by option A (35).
