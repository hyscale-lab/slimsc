Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. So, the star moves a bit because the planet's orbit causes it. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's velocity towards or away from us.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are given, and I need to find the right one.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the RV method depends on the mass of the planet and its distance from the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think of the simplified version. Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula can be simplified.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

But that's getting complicated. Maybe there's a more straightforward way.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, the denominator is approximately M_star^(2/3), and (M_star + M_p) can be approximated as M_star. So:

K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Hmm, but G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, etc. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the sum of the masses. Since M_p is much less than M_star, it's approximately P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³.

But how does that tie into the RV method?

The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Again, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

We can write K ∝ M_p / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )

But wait, the problem says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. So M_p for both planets is the same, and M_star is the same for both. So M_p and M_star are the same for both planets.

So for both planets, M_p and M_star are same. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and 2, then:

K1/K2 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) / (1 / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Which can be rearranged as (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait no, let me think again.

From K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means shorter period.

So if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7, then K2>K1. So P2 is longer than P1. Because K goes down as P increases.

So given that, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So the ratio K1/K2 is 5/7.

Then, using (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So (125)/(343) = P2/P1.

So P2 is (125/343) times P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So the ratio is P2 / P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but that's about 0.36 times. So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter. Hmm, but earlier I thought K2 is larger, implying P2 is longer. Did I get this right?

Wait, I might have made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me go back.

The formula I derived is K ∝ M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But M_p and M_star are same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K is higher when P is smaller.

So Planet #2 has a higher K (7 vs 5), so its period is shorter.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet 1, which is shorter.

But the question is how many times longer is planet 2's period compared to planet 1's. Since 0.36 is less than 1, it's shorter. So the factor is less than 1, but the options don't have a negative or inverse. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So option A is 0.36, which would imply P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. If P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So perhaps I have an error in my reasoning.

Wait, the question says, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if the orbital period of planet #2 is longer, then the ratio P2/P1 would be greater than 1. But according to my calculation, it's about 0.36, which is less than 1.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ratio. Let me check again.

The formula I used was (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364 → P2 = 0.364 * P1

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is asking how much longer is P2 than P1. That would be P2 / P1 = 0.36, which is less than 1. So the period of P2 is shorter. So it's not longer. Did I misinterpret the question?

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the reciprocal. Let me think again. Let me write the equation correctly.

We have K1 = 5, K2 =7.

From K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1 / K.

So P1 ∝ 1/K1, P2 ∝1/K2.

So P2/P1 = (1/K2) / (1/K1) ) = K1 / K2 → P2/P1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because P ∝ 1/K, so P2 = (K1/K2) * P1.

Wait, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So again, P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which is shorter. So planet 2 has a shorter period than planet 1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So maybe the question is reversed. Wait, the question says: How many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times longer. But 0.36 is less than 1, which actually means P2 is shorter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the proportionality. Let me try another approach.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1) / ( (2 pi)^(1/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star and e=0, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1) / ( (2 pi)^(1/3) )

Wait, alternatively, I can write it as:

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So rearranging,

K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * P^(-1/3)

Which can be written as K ∝ P^(-1/3), since the other terms are constants (same for both planets).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Because K1 = constant * P1^(-1/3), and K2 = constant * P2^(-1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Given K1=5 and K2=7,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 of P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. That would be P2 / P1. But since P2 is 0.364 times P1, P2 is shorter. So the factor is 0.364 times, meaning it's 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

But the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer would be A) ~0.36. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1. Since 0.36 is less than 1, it's actually shorter. So the answer would be that planet #2's period is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's, which is shorter. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

But wait, the question is phrased as: how many times longer is P2 than P1. If the answer is 0.36, that would mean it's 0.36 times as long, so shorter. But the options don't have a negative sign. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but maybe I got the ratio reversed. Let me try the reciprocal. Let me see.

If the formula is K ∝ P^(-1/3), then P ∝ 1/K.

So P1 = C/K1, P2 = C/K2.

So P2/P1 = (C/K2)/(C/K1) ) = K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Wait, that's different. Now, P2 is 0.714 times P1. So 0.714 is about 0.71, which is not one of the options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is that since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/(K)^(3).

Wait, let me think again. Let's write:

From K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 = constant / P1^(1/3)

K2 = constant / P2^(1/3)

Divide both equations: K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides: 125/343 = P2/P1.

So P2 is (125/343) times P1, which is approximately 0.364 times.

So, P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's shorter.

So the answer is option A) ~0.36.

But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's ~0.36 times as long. So the answer is A.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( -1/3 \), i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 \, P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is compared to \( P_1 \), the factor is less than 1, and the correct answer is approximately 0.36.
