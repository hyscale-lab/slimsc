Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Alright, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges, especially when they're uncharged or have cavities.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So, imagine a big sphere with a smaller hollow sphere inside, not exactly at the center because s is the distance between the two centers.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l is greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

I'm a bit confused about how the setup looks. Let me visualize it: the conductor is a larger sphere, the cavity is inside but not at the center. The charge q is inside the cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside it, I think the charges in the conductor will redistribute.

Wait, right. When a conductor is uncharged but has a charge inside a cavity, the charges on the inner surface of the conductor must be equal and opposite to the enclosed charge. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the inner surface will have a charge -q. But then, the outer surface must still have a net charge, but wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral. So the inner surface has -q, the outer surface has +q to balance, making the conductor neutral overall.

Wait no, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the conductor must have a charge of -q on the inner surface. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, it's inner surface -q, and outer surface +q. Wait, no, because the conductor's own charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q? No, wait, that would make the total charge of the conductor (-q + q )= 0, which is correct. But wait, I think I'm mixing things up.

Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. The charge q is inside the cavity. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Because in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have -q. But the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q. Therefore, the total charge on the conductor is zero.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor (L > R). So the electric field at P is due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface that includes P. The Gaussian surface here would be a sphere of radius L, centered where? Well, the conductor is a sphere, so the Gaussian surface should be centered at the same point as the conductor.

Wait, no, the Gaussian surface's center depends on the setup. If the conductor is spherical and the Gaussian surface is a sphere, it's centered on the same point as the conductor. So, to find the electric field at P, which is a point outside the conductor, we can use Gauss's Law. The Gaussian surface in this case would enclose all the charge inside it.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface (radius L) is +q. Because any charge on the outer surface is on the Gaussian surface if L is larger than R. But wait, no, the Gaussian surface is outside the conductor, so it encloses the conductor, including any charge on it. So the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q.

So the electric field E at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / (L²), where Q_enclosed is +q. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but that's assuming that the charge distribution on the conductor's outer surface is spherically symmetric. Because if the conductor is a sphere, then the outer surface charge would be uniformly distributed, and the field outside would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So yes, E is q/(4πε₀ L²).

But wait, in this problem, the charge is located off-center. The cavity is not at the center of the conductor, so s is not zero. The charge +q is somewhere inside the cavity, but the setup is that the conductor's inner surface must adjust to cancel the field inside the conductor.

But when the charge is off-center, like in a cavity that's not at the center, the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge distribution that's not uniform. But for the outer surface, because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface's charge would still be +q, but I'm not sure if it's uniformly distributed.

Wait, no. The outer surface of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is a equipotential, and the charge distribution on the outer surface depends on the geometry. If the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, perhaps the outer surface's charge distribution is no longer spherically symmetric. But wait, for a conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the external electric fields. If there are no external fields (like in this case, the conductor is isolated), the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the charge inside the cavity is off-center, the inner surface would have a non-uniform distribution, but the outer surface may still remain uniform. Hmm.

Wait, I think that the outer surface charge distribution remains spherically symmetric if the conductor is a sphere. Because the conductor is neutral, the inner surface has -q, but the outer surface has +q. But if the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform — it's more on the side closer to the charge. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would have a uniform distribution because it's only influenced by the inner surface's charges and any external fields. Since there are no external fields (the conductor is isolated), the outer surface's charge should be uniformly distributed.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The outer surface's charge distribution depends on the inner surface's charge distribution. Because the inner surface is not uniformly charged, the electric field within the conductor (which is zero) is zero. But the outer surface's distribution must ensure that the net field inside the conductor is zero. But wait, since the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, any excess charge must lie on it, but the distribution may not be uniform if the inner surface is not symmetric.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the problem again. The point P is outside the conductor. So the distance from the center of the conductor to P is L. The conductor is a sphere with radius R. So, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field depends on the total charge enclosed within the conductor's outer surface.

In this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface (radius L) is +q, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the charge were at the center. Because the conductor's outer surface ensures that.

Wait, but what if the conductor is not a sphere? Oh, but in this case, it's a spherical conductor. So, for a spherical conductor, any charge inside the cavity (even off-center) will cause the inner surface to have an induced charge, but the outer surface will have a uniform distribution. So the field outside is the same as if all the charge were at the center.

So the electric field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²).

Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²) — which matches.

Wait, but another option is option D: (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l²). Hmm, l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. But the conductor's outer surface is at radius R, so L > R. The point P is at radius L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. So, in this case, the electric field would be due to the outer surface charge, which is at the conductor's center. So the distance from P to the center of the charge is L, not l.

Wait, but the cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center. So the conductor's center is at O, the cavity's center is at O', and the point P is at a distance L from O. The distance from O' to P is l. So the displacement vector from O to O' is s in some direction, and from O' to P is l.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so when considering the field outside the conductor, the only charge that matters is the total charge on the outer surface, and that charge acts as if it's at the center of the sphere. So the field at P would be the same as if the charge +q were at O, the center of the conductor, regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity.

Therefore, the electric field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside a spherical conductor with a cavity, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Cavity Setup**: The conductor is uncharged, with radius $R$, and contains a small spherical cavity of radius $r$, whose center is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Charge Distribution**: Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface of the conductor (at the cavity's wall) must induce a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor, being a sphere in electrostatic equilibrium, will uniformly distribute the remaining charge $+q$ to maintain the neutrality of the conductor.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a point $P$ outside the conductor (at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor), the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor's outer surface. By Gauss's Law, the electric field at $P$ is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which does not describe the electric field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, which depends only on $q$ and $L$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the denominator involves $l^2$, the electric field outside the conductor depends on $L$, not $l$, as $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the application of Gauss's Law.
