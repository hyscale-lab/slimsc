Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model, for a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms connected by a bond, so in this case, atoms X and Y.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So for both rotation and vibration, it's the ground state. Now, the question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. So, we're looking for the photon's momentum that causes a transition from the ground state to the next possible state with the least energy.

The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. Let me jot those down:

Mx = 20 amu (atomic mass units)
My = 2 amu
R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters
w (angular frequency) = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, but wait—wait, the problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. I think that model combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are quantized for both. But when a photon is absorbed, it's usually a transition between these quantized states.

In the non-rigid rotor model, unlike the rigid rotor, the bond length can change, so the moment of inertia isn't fixed. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe I should first consider whether the transition involves a change in rotation, vibration, or both.

Wait, but photons usually cause transitions by providing energy to either the vibrational or rotational modes. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule can transition either by changing rotation state, vibration state, or both. But the next lowest state might be the first excited state of either rotation or vibration, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. For the rigid rotor, the lowest state is J=0, and the next would be J=1. The energy difference for this transition would be from J=0 to J=1, which is ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I)) (1*2 - 0) )= ħ²/(2I) * 2 = ħ²/(I). 

But wait, the non-rigid rotor might have a different approach, but perhaps for this problem, the main thing is the vibrational energy. Or maybe the model includes both, but the problem states it's the rotation-vibration model. Hmm.

Wait, the angular frequency given is for vibration, not rotation. So perhaps the energy transition is for the vibrational mode. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (hν/2)(2n +1), where n is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is n=0, and the next state would be n=1. The energy difference would be ΔE_vib = (hν/2)(3 -1) )= hν/2 * 2 = hν.

So the energy of the absorbed photon should match the energy difference between the vibrational levels. So the photon's energy E_photon = hν, where ν is the frequency. But wait, the given w is the angular frequency, so ν = w/(2π) rad/s.

So, E_photon = h * (w/(2π)) = h w / (2π) = ħ w.

Wait, because h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π), so h w/(2π) is ħ w. So, E_photon = ħ w.

So, the photon's energy is ħ w. But the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Hmm, photons have momentum p = E/c, since for photons, E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So, p = E_photon / c = (ħ w) / c.

Wait, but wait, that's only true if the photon is moving in a vacuum at speed c. So, yeah, that's correct. So, p = ħ w / c.

Let me compute this. But wait, what are the given values?

w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute ħ w / c.

But first, let me make sure I have the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the vibrational energy. But I'm a bit confused about whether the molecule's transition is rotational or vibrational.

Wait, the problem says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, if it's a rotation-vibration model, perhaps the next state would involve the first excited state of either rotation or vibration. But which requires a lower energy jump?

Well, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I), with I being the moment of inertia. But wait, I think the rotational energy levels might be lower in energy than the vibrational ones, so perhaps the next state is a rotational transition. But wait, in reality, vibrational energy levels are usually higher than rotational ones, so maybe the photon's energy would correspond to a rotational transition.

But wait, the problem specifies that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which suggests that the coupling of rotation and vibration is considered. But perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest in both, and the next state could be a change in either. But the question is about the lowest possible energy, so perhaps the next state is the first possible higher state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should compute both and see which one matches the options given.

Wait, but the given angular frequency w is for vibration, and the problem provides R, the bond length. So perhaps the transition is vibrational, and the energy is for the vibration. Because the problem gives w as the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, but in that case, the energy of the photon would be h ν = h (w/(2π)) ), which is E_photon = ħ w. Then, the momentum p_photon is E_photon / c = (ħ w)/c.

So, let's compute that. Let me get the constants:

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s
w is 4e14 rad/s
c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So, p = (1.0545718e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s) / 3e8 m/s

Wait, but wait: Let me calculate the numerator first. 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218287e-20 J·s·rad/s.

But since rad is dimensionless, the units are J·s. But J is kg·m²/s². So, J·s = kg·m²/s.

Divided by 3e8 m/s: (kg·m²/s) / (m/s) )= kg·m/s = kg·m/s.

So, the units are kg·m/s, which is the same as N·s, since 1 N = 1 kg·m/s², so N·s = kg·m/s. So, the units are correct for momentum.

Now, compute the numerical value:

4.218287e-20 / 3e8 = approximately 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Wait, so p ≈ 1.4e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is a bit higher.

Hmm. So that would suggest the correct answer is D. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the transition is vibrational. Because the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I thought is a model that includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but another approach: considering the rotational transition. The energy difference for rotational transitions would be from J=0 to J=1.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2I), with I being the moment of inertia.

I is the moment of inertia, which for a diatomic is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Wait, μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Wait, but 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Now, I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

B is ħ²/(2I). So, ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

B = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.208e-46 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J²·s²)
Denominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ approximately 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the energy difference for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] = B (2).

So ΔE_rot = 2 * 4.6e-23 J = 9.2e-23 J.

This is the energy required for a rotational transition. But let's compare this to the vibrational transition's energy.

Earlier, we calculated the vibrational energy E_photon as ħ w = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * 4e14 rad/s ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, that's 4.218e-20 J, which is way higher than the rotational ΔE of 9.2e-23 J. So the vibrational transition requires much higher energy than the rotational. So if the molecule is in the ground state (J=0, n=0), the next possible state with the lowest energy would be either J=1 or n=1.

But which one has a lower energy difference? From the numbers, the rotational transition requires less energy. So perhaps the photon would need to provide the rotational energy.

Wait, but wait: the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for vibration is n=0, and for rotation J=0. So the next state could either be J=1 (rotational) or n=1 (vibrational). Which has lower energy? Let's compute the two ΔE.

We have ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = h ν = ħ w = 4.218e-20 J.

So, ΔE_rot is much smaller than ΔE_vib. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational transition, J=1. So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but the options given are all in the 1e-27 to 2e-27 range for momentum. Wait, wait a second—if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, then the momentum would be p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are 1e-27, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the transition is vibrational or rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the rotational energy but only the vibrational.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I calculated the rotational energy difference, I used B = ħ²/(2I), and I computed B as 4.6e-23 J. So ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J. So the momentum would be 9.2e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where both rotation and vibration change. But that complicates things.

Wait, another thought: the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Non-rigid rotor implies that the bond length changes, so vibration is involved. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational energy.

Wait, but earlier calculation for the vibrational photon momentum gave me about 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D. But I'm not sure why the rotational approach isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which in rotation-vibration coupling would be a change in both J and n. But that's probably more complicated, and I don't think the problem expects that level of detail.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is focused on the vibrational energy only, and the rotational part is not considered in this transition because the molecule is in the ground state of rotation. So the next state would be the first vibrational excited state. That would mean the photon's energy is ħ w, which as I calculated earlier would give a momentum of about 1.4e-28 kg·m/s, matching option D.

But why was the rotational approach giving a much lower energy, but no matching option? Because the options given are in the 1e-27 to 2e-27 range, which is higher than the 1.4e-28 I calculated. Hmm. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for the vibrational transition. So here's what I did:

E_photon = ħ w = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Then, p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D. So why is the rotational approach giving a much lower value that's not present in the options?

Ah! Maybe the problem is asking for the photon to cause a transition from the fundamental state to the next possible state with the lowest energy, which could be either a change in rotation or vibration. But since the vibrational energy is higher than the rotational, the lowest transition is the rotational. But the options don't include that, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition not from J=0 to J=1, but from J=1 to J=2, but that would make the energy even higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let me recalculate B. Let's compute I again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(20 + 2) = (40 amu^2) / 22 amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Converting to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46)

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, correct. So the energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But this gives a photon momentum of 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns, which is not any of the options.

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is about the vibrational transition, and the options include a value around 1.4e-28, which is option D.

But let me think again: the problem says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which I think combines both rotation and vibration. However, the problem is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, both rotationally and vibrationally. So the next state would be the next possible state with the lowest energy, which could be either J=1 or n=1. Since the energy required for the rotational transition is much less than the vibrational, why isn't that the option?

Wait, but the options don't have a value around 1e-31. So perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, and I'm overcomplicating this by considering rotation. Let's proceed under that assumption.

So, going back: the photon's energy is ħ w, and the momentum is ħ w / c.

Calculating that:

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s

w = 4e14 rad/s

c = 3e8 m/s.

So p = (1.055e-34 *4e14) / 3e8.

Calculate numerator: 1.055e-34 *4e14 = 4.22e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg·m/s = 1.407e-28 N·s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state for both rotation (J=0) and vibration (n=0). The question asks for the momentum of the photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest energy.

### Key Information and Analysis:
1. **Given Data**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Energy Transitions**:
   - The molecule can transition either through a rotational change (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)) or a vibrational change (\( n = 0 \to n = 1 \)). The energy difference for the rotational transition is much smaller than that for the vibrational transition, as vibrational energy levels are typically higher than rotational ones.
   - The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{h \nu}{2} (2n + 1) \), where \( \nu = \omega / (2\pi) \) is the vibrational frequency. The energy difference for the transition from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \) is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = \hbar \omega \).

3. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:
   - The energy of the photon required for the vibrational transition is \( E_{\text{photon}} = \hbar \omega \).
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = E_{\text{photon}} / c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.

4. **Substituting Values**:
   - Planck's constant: \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
   - Speed of light: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Angular frequency: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

   The momentum of the photon is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14})}{3 \times 10^8}
   \]
   Simplify the numerator:
   \[
   \hbar \omega = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 4.2182872 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J·s·rad/s}
   \]
   Divide by \( c \):
   \[
   p = \frac{4.2182872 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated momentum \( p \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \) matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The photon must have a momentum of \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \) to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

**Answer: D**
