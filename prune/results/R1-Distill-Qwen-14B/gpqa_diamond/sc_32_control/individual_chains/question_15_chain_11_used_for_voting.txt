Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their stars. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is one way to detect planets, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits. Interesting.

The stars they're orbiting have the same radius, but the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Wait, same radius but different masses? I thought more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe they're evolved in some way here. Since Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but both stars have the same radii. So, Star_1 (Planet_1's star) has mass M1 = 2*M2, but R1 = R2.

The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So, I need to find out which planet has a higher transit probability.

From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability P is approximately (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by the (1 / (a_planet / R_star)), but wait, no, I think I'm mixing some terms here.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_p / a)² * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) ), but that might not be right. Alternatively, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (something involving the orbital distance). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the (1 / (a / R_s)).

Wait, no, I should probably recall the correct formula. Oh right! The probability P is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), but wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), because the planet has to be in the right orbital plane (so the probability relates to the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth compared to the planet's orbit). Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The transit probability is given by the ratio of the area of the star (as seen from Earth) to the area of the planet's orbit. Or perhaps it's the probability that, from our line of sight, the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits the star. So, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, but also depends on the distance from the star, a. Hmm, no, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a).

Wait, no, I think the formula is P = (R_p / a)² * (R_s / a). No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability that this happens is proportional to the area where the planet's orbit would cause a transit relative to the star's position in the sky. So, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)).

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability for a planet is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). Because a is the semi-major axis, which is the distance from the star. So a planet with a smaller semi-major axis (closer in) would have a higher probability because R_s/a is larger when a is smaller.

Wait, let me get this right. The transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). So P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p^2 * R_s / (R_s^2 a) ) = R_p^2 / (R_s a).

So P = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the planet is closer (smaller a), then this fraction is larger, leading to higher probability.

So the factors affecting P are the planet's radius, the star's radius, and the orbital distance (a). But in this problem, we don't have the planet radii given. Oh wait! The question says both planets have the same mass, but not necessarily same radius. Hmm. Wait, but mass and radius don't directly correlate for planets because a planet with the same mass could have different radii depending on composition. Oh, but wait, the question doesn't state their radii. So how can we compare R_p1 and R_p2?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Oh, wait, the question says, "the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets." So only the host stars' masses and radii are known. The planets' radii aren't given. Hmm. That complicates things. Because without knowing R_p1 and R_p2, we can't directly compute P. Unless there's another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reread the problem.

The question says: Both planets have the same masses. So their minimum masses are the same. So M_p1 = M_p2.

But for transiting probability, R_p is what matters, not mass. So, same mass doesn't necessarily mean same radius. So unless we can relate their radii to their masses, we can't proceed. But the problem doesn't provide any info about the planets' radii. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is assuming that Earth-like planets have the same radius as Earth. Because it says "Earth-like planets." Oh, wait! The question says the planets are Earth-like. So perhaps their radii are the same as Earth's? So R_p1 = R_p2 = R_earth.

If that's the case, then R_p is the same for both planets, so that term cancels out when comparing their probabilities.

So P is proportional to (R_p^2) / (R_s * a). So for each planet, P = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a).

But since R_p is same for both, P is inversely proportional to (R_s * a).

Wait, no. Wait, the formula I thought was P = R_p^2/( R_s * a ). So higher a would lower the probability, same R_s.

But wait, let's think again. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). So that would be R_p^2 / ( R_s^2 ) * R_s / a ) = R_p^2/( R_s a ). So yes, same as before.

So, for both planets, since R_p is same, the probability is inversely proportional to (R_s * a). So higher R_s or higher a would lower P.

So let's compute for each planet.

But first, what are a1 and a2? Because Kepler's third law relates a to the orbital period and the star's mass.

The orbital period P is given. Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 3*P1.

Using Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_s + M_p)/ (4 pi^2). But since M_p << M_s, we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So, a^3 = [ (G M_s )/(4 pi^2) ] * P^2.

So a = [ (G M_s P^2 )/(4 pi^2) ]^(1/3).

But since the planets have the same mass and the host stars have different masses, but the periods are different.

Wait, let's compute a1 and a2.

Given:

For Planet_1: Period P1.

Host star mass M1 = 2*M2.

For Planet_2: Period P2 = 3 * P1.

Host star mass M2.

So, let's write a1 and a2 in terms of M2 and P1.

a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet_1: a1 = [ (G M1 * P1^2 )/(4 pi^2) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ (G M2 * (3 P1)^2 )/(4 pi^2) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify:

a1 = [ G * (2 M2) * P1^2 / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G * M2 * 9 P1^2 / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the expressions.

a1 = ( 2 G M2 P1^2 / (4 pi^2) )^(1/3 ) = ( (G M2 P1^2) / (2 pi^2) ) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( 9 G M2 P1^2 / (4 pi^2) ) )^(1/3 )

We can factor out (G M2 P1^2 / (4 pi^2)) )^(1/3 ) from both.

So let me factor that:

Let’s compute a1:

a1 = [ (2 / 4 pi^2 ) * (G M2 P1^2 ) / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 ) Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to write a1 and a2 as ratios.

Let’s compute a2 / a1.

a2 / a1 = [ (9 G M2 (3 P1)^2 ) / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ (G M1 P1^2 )/(4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, M1=2 M2, so M1=2 M2.

So:

a2/a1 = [ (9 G M2 (9 P1^2 )) / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 ) / [ (G * 2 M2 * P1^2 ) / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, a1 is for Planet_1, so its period is P1, and a2 is for Planet_2, period 3 P1.

So:

a1 = [ G (2 M2) (P1)^2/(4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G (M2) (3 P1)^2/(4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

So a2 = [ G M2 (9 P1^2) / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

So simplifying a2/a1:

a2/a1 = [ (G M2 9 P1^2 / (4 pi^2) ) / ( G 2 M2 P1^2 / (4 pi^2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

The G, M2, P1^2, and denominator 4 pi^2 terms cancel out.

So numerator: 9

Denominator: 2

So ratio inside the cube root: 9/2.

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is approximately 1.65 times a1.

Hmm, so a2 = 1.65 a1.

Wait, but wait, that would mean that Planet_2 is further away from its star than Planet_1 is from its star, since a is larger.

Now, going back to transit probability.

P = (R_p^2 ) / ( R_s * a )

But since R_p is same for both planets, and R_s is same for both stars because R_s1 = R_s2.

So P is inversely proportional to a.

Because R_p is same, R_s is same, so P is proportional to 1/a.

So, since a2 is larger than a1, P1 (probability for Planet_1) is higher than P2.

Wait, because P is inversely proportional to a. So if a2 is 1.65 a1, then P1 = (1 / a1 ) * const, P2 = (1/a2 ) * const.

So P1 is (1/a1) = (1.65 a1 )^{-1} * a2/a1? Wait, perhaps a better way.

Wait, since a2 = 1.65 a1, then P2 = (1/a2) * (something) → P2 = (1/(1.65 a1 )) * (something).

P1 is (1/a1) * (something).

So P1 is larger than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, the question allows us to know the planets' orbital periods and masses, and the stars' masses and radii. But according to the problem, the host stars have the same radius. So R_s is same for both.

So, R_s is same → R_s cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the transit probability for each is:

P1 = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a1 )

P2 = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a2 )

So P1/P2 = a2 / a1.

Because P1/P2 = [ (R_p^2)/(R_s a1) ] / [ (R_p^2)/(R_s a2) ] = a2/a1.

We found earlier that a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but the options are about which one is preferred. The researchers want to observe the one with higher probability.

So Planet_1 is preferred, as its probability is higher.

So looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but according to our calculation, P1 is 1.65 times P2.

So the probability of Planet_1 is higher, and it's approximately 1.65 times higher.

So the correct option would be C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii (\(R_p\)) are assumed to be the same. Additionally, the stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), so the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis (\(a\)).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance (\(a\)) Using Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law relates the semi-major axis (\(a\)) to the orbital period (\(P\)) and the star's mass (\(M_s\)):

\[
a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto (M_1 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3}
\]

Given:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\)
- \(P_2 = 3P_1\)

Substituting:
\[
a_1 \propto (2M_2 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3}
\]
\[
a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot (3P_1)^2)^{1/3} = (M_2 \cdot 9P_1^2)^{1/3}
\]

Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{(9)^{1/3}}{(2)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, \(a_2 \approx 1.65a_1\).

### Step 2: Transit Probability
Since \(P \propto \frac{1}{a}\) (and \(R_p\) and \(R_s\) are the same for both planets), the transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability. Among the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
