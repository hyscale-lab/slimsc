Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I remember from my notes that operators and their matrix representations play a big role here.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, wait, I think I should normalize this state first. Because probabilities require the state to be a unit vector. So, I need to find the normalization constant. Let me calculate the inner product of the state with itself.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Wait, no, since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner products are delta_ij. So the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Let me compute each term.

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 1 -i +i +1 = 2.

Second term: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2*2 + 2*i - i*2 -i*i = 4 +2i -2i -i². Again, i² is -1, so 4 +0i +1 =5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the operator's matrix is given as A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, zero otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, A would look like:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

Because when i≠j, each element is hbar/2, else zero. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

I need to find the eigenstates of this operator. Because the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A is what's being asked. Also, the average value of A.

Wait, but eigenstates of A are the states where A acts as a scaling. So to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

Alternatively, since this is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps there's a way to find its eigenvalues quickly. The matrix is [[0, a], [a, 0]], where a = hbar/2.

The eigenvalues λ are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

So:

| -λ    a    |
| a    -λ    | = 0

Which gives λ² - a² = 0. So λ = ±a.

So the eigenvalues are a and -a.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = a = hbar/2:

(A - a I) |v> = 0. So the matrix becomes:

[[-a, a],
 [a, -a]]

Which simplifies to rows that are multiples of each other. So the equations are -a v1 + a v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

Thus, the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1).

Similarly, for λ = -a:

Matrix is [[a, a], [a, a]]. So the equation a v1 + a v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1).

So the eigenstates are (1,1) and (1,-1), normalized.

So the eigenstates |+> and |-> are:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, because (1,1) corresponds to |up> + |down>, but normalized by 1/sqrt(2). Similarly for (1,-1).

So now, the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates. Because when you express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->, the coefficients will be the probabilities amplitudes, and their squares will give the probabilities.

So let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->

I need to compute c_+ and c_-.

But first, let me write |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+> = [ |up> + |down> ] / sqrt(2)
|-> = [ |up> - |down> ] / sqrt(2)

So to find c_+:

c_+ = < + | alpha >

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha >

Let me compute c_+:

c_+ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * |alpha>

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

Wait, <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
Simplify numerator: (1+2) + (i -i) =3 +0i → 3.

So c_+ = (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_-:

c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Compute numerator: (1-2) + (i + i ) → (-1) + 2i.

So numerator is (-1 + 2i).

So c_- = (-1 + 2i) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, let me check that calculation. Oh no, wait: <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7). So subtracting gives (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 + 2i.

So yes, c_- is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

(3)^2 / (14) → 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... which is about 0.64.

Compute |c_-|²:

The numerator is (-1 +2i)(-1 -2i) = 1 + 2i -2i -4i² → 1 +0i +4 =5.

So |c_-|² =5/14 ≈0.357142... which is approximately 0.36.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. And 5/14 is 0.357142, which is 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the eigenstates.

Wait, the operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, the eigenvalues are ±a, where a = hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question says "the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij, such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise."

So the eigenstates are as I found: (1,1) and (1,-1).

So the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+> and |->. So the coefficients are c_+ and c_-, which I calculated.

So the probabilities are |c_+|² = 9/14 ≈0.6428, and |c_-|²=5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches. Option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which is different.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

The expectation value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is Hermitian (as it's a spin operator's matrix), perhaps another approach is to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, and then the expectation value is sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, yes. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is c_+ λ_+ + c_- λ_-, where λ_+ and λ_- are the eigenvalues.

But wait, the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So <A> = ( |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) ) + ( |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2) )

Which is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )

= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (hbar/2 )

= (4/14) * (hbar/2 )

Simplify: 4/(14) = 2/7. So 2/7 * hbar/2 = (1/7) hbar.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. Option D says 2 hbar/sqrt(7), which is different.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, another way to compute the average is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me compute that to confirm.

First, express A in the basis of |up>, |down>.

So A is [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So to compute <alpha| A |alpha>, we can write it as:

[ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Let me compute this:

First, multiply the vector by A.

Wait, no, let me compute the matrix product.

The matrix A is:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

So the vector is v = [ a, b ] where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2−i)/sqrt(7).

Compute A*v:

[ 0 * a + (hbar/2) * b,
  (hbar/2)*a + 0 * b ]

So the top component is (hbar/2)*b, the bottom is (hbar/2)*a.

Then, the inner product with [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] is:

( (1−i)/sqrt(7) ) * [ (hbar/2) b ] + ( (2+i)/sqrt(7) ) * [ (hbar/2) a ]

Factor out (hbar/2) / sqrt(7):

= [ (1−i) b + (2+i) a ] * (hbar/ (2 * sqrt(7)) )

Now, substitute a and b:

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2−i)/sqrt(7)

So:

(1−i) * (2−i)/sqrt(7) + (2+i) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) 

= [ (1−i)(2−i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] / sqrt(7)

Compute each term:

(1−i)(2−i) = 2*(1) +1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 → 2 -i -2i + (-1) → 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Wait, let me compute step by step:

(1)(2) = 2

(1)(-i) = -i

(-i)(2) = -2i

(-i)(-i) = i² = -1

So adding up: 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) + (-3i) → 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i → 2 +2i +i + (-1) → (2-1) +3i → 1 +3i.

So adding the two terms:

(1−3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the numerator is 2.

Thus, the inner product becomes (2) / sqrt(7) * (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) )

Wait, the expression earlier was [ ... ] * (hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) )

So:

(2 / sqrt(7)) * (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) )

Simplify:

(2 * hbar) / (2 *7) ) → hbar/(7)

Which matches the earlier calculation. So the average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's correct.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: Is there a possibility that I messed up the eigenstates? Because the matrix A is the same as the spin-x operator scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1], [1 0]], and here A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2,0 ]].

So the eigenstates are indeed |+x> and |−x>, which are the same as I found: (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Therefore, the approach is correct.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization constant is determined by computing the inner product of the state with itself:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) can now be expressed in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \). The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are computed as:

\[
c_+ = \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle + \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right),
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle - \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right).
\]

Substituting \( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we find:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( A \) and \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2 \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
