Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse its structure.

First, I'll try to visualize the target compound. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Wait, no, wait. The name is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the cyclohexane has a -CHO group attached. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a formyl group. Then, attached to this main ring is another cyclohexyl group, but not directly. Let me see the substituents.

The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, there's a methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane ring. That methyl group is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is like the main cyclohexane with a -CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group attached. Wait, no, maybe it's a branching. So, the main ring has a -CH2- group, but the CH2 is attached to another cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally: the main ring is cyclohexane, with a substituent which is a CH group that has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) attached to the main ring. So the structure is:

Main ring: cyclohexane-CH(OH-cyclohexyl) and a formyl group (CHO) on the same carbon? Or is the formyl on a different carbon? Wait, wait. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the carbaldehyde is on carbon 1, and the substituent is also on carbon 1. So the main chain is the cyclohexane ring, and carbon 1 has both the formyl group and the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The name is 1-(something)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) on carbon 1. Then, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group also on carbon 1. So carbon 1 has both the formyl and the substituent, which is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group?

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which would be a CH2 group where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl group and another by a hydroxyl? So, perhaps it's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring. But in any case, I'm getting stuck on the structure, so maybe I should think about how to approach the synthesis.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) attached. Okay, so the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is in turn attached to the main cyclohexane with a formyl group. So, perhaps the ethynyl is being converted into something else.

Let me think about possible reactions. The ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond, which can undergo various reactions. One common approach is to add hydrogen to the triple bond. Hydrogenation could be done using H2 and a catalyst like Pd. So, if we hydrogenate the triple bond, it would become a single bond, giving cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no, hydrogenating an ethynyl group (which is -C≡CH) would add two Hs across the triple bond. So the product would be -CH2CH2- but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is between two carbons. Oh wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So when you hydrogenate that, you get -CH2CH2-, but in the case of cyclohexane, it's actually -CH2CH2- but as a substituent. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to say that hydrogenation of the triple bond would give a single bond. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would become cyclohexane-CH2CH2, but wait, that's not possible because ethynyl is a substituent. Let me correct: the triple bond is between the cyclohexane carbon and the other carbon. So hydrogenation would add Hs to each carbon, so the triple bond (-C≡CH) becomes a single bond (-CH2CH2-), but wait, that's not correct. Wait, the hydrogenation of a triple bond (C≡CH) to a single bond (CH2CH3?) No, wait, when you hydrogenate an alkyne (triple bond), you can do it stepwise. Partial hydrogenation would give an alkene (cis or trans), and full hydrogenation would give an alkane.

But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

If we hydrogenate this, using H2 and a catalyst like Pd, what happens? The triple bond becomes a single bond, so it becomes cyclohexane-CH2CH3. So that's a cyclohexane with an ethyl group attached.

Wait, but that would just be ethylcyclohexane. But how does this help in getting to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps we're looking at a different approach. Maybe introducing a functional group that can be oxidized or functionalized further.

Another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So perhaps the ethynyl group is being converted into something else, like a ketone or an alcohol.

Wait, another possibility: using a Grignard reaction. Could the ethynyl group be modified to form a ketone or an aldehyde?

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible reagents in the options. Let's look at the options provided.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. 2. H2/Pd. 3. Ba(OH)2. 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So step 1: maybe an alkylation. So, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl. What would that do? Maybe the ethynyl group is deprotonated, and then alkylated.

Wait, wait, ethynyl group (sp-hybridized) is acidic. The terminal alkyne protons are more acidic than alkenes or alkanes. So NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate the alkyne to form an alkyne anion. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) could alkylate this. So the alkyne anion would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal H would give cyclohexane-C≡C- (the anion). Then, methyl chloride would provide CH3+ which the anion would attack. So the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's not possible because adding a methyl to the terminal alkyne would give a longer alkyne. Wait, but cyclohexane-C≡CH can't add a methyl to the triple bond to form a longer alkyne because the alkyne is terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a different structure. Let me think again. If we have NaNH2 and methyl chloride, that's a typical method for alkylation. For example, if you have a terminal alkyne, you can deprotonate it with a strong base like NaNH2 to form the acetylide ion, which can then react with an alkyl halide in an alkylation.

So, in this case, the ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) would be deprotonated by NaNH2 to form cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with this, so the acetylide attacks the CH3Cl, resulting in cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that's 1-ethylcyclohexane? Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexane with a propynyl group (CH2CH2?), no. Wait, no, in the product, it's cyclohexane-C#C-CH3. So that's 1-propynylcyclohexane. Wait, no, the ethynyl group is CH2-C≡CH? Or wait no, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Adding a methyl via alkylation would make it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that's a propynyl group attached to the cyclohexane (like cyclohexane-1-propyne?).

Wait, okay, so after step 1, the structure becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 (1-propynylcyclohexane). Then, step 2 is H2/Pd. So that would hydrogenate the triple bond. Hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add two Hs across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (CH2-CH2)? Wait, but that's not possible because that would make a four-carbon chain, but the starting point is a cyclohexane with a propynyl group.

Wait, if the structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would convert that into cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So ethylcyclohexane, but longer chain? Wait, no. Propynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C#C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add Hs across the triple bond, making it CH2-CH2. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? That can't be right because that would be a branch of three carbons, but the original is cyclohexane connected to a propynyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each step for each option.

Option A: Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes something else. Then step 2: H2/Pd to hydrogenate. Then step 3: Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or oxidation? And step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like a hydration or oxidation, perhaps in the presence of HgSO4, which is used in the oxymercuration reaction. Or maybe it's a Jones oxidation?

Wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 in aqueous conditions... that might be a variant of the oxymercuration reaction, but more likely, it's a hydration of an alkene. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, perhaps in the Cope elimination or other eliminations.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol or a vicinal diol, which could then undergo oxidation or some kind of elimination.

Wait, another approach: Maybe we're using a ketone or aldehyde formation. The target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So perhaps oxidation is involved.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. One way to get an aldehyde is via oxidation of an alkyl group.

Wait, but if we have an ethynyl group, maybe it can be converted into a ketone or aldehyde. Another thought: using oxymercuration or similar to add an O and an H across a double bond. But how do we get a double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence involves introducing a carbonyl group. Wait, the target has a formyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: The target has a formyl group on the main cyclohexane. So perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane is being functionalized to add the formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group via alkylation to the ethynyl group.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, introducing a CH2CH3 group.
3. Then perform some kind of oxidation or cleavage.

But I'm not sure. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → same as before, alkylation of the alkyne to make propynylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So hydrogenation of the propynyl group. So propynylcyclohexane → cyclohexane with a propyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the triple bond is C≡C. Upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, the triple becomes a single, so the propynyl group would become a propyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain. Then step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis. So if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but after step 2, the molecule is ethylcyclohexane (if step 2 added a ethyl group). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me retrace.

Option C step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane. Wait, but that would require a different catalyst. No, Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds. So propynylcyclohexane (after step 1) would become cyclohexane with a propyl group attached as a single bond. So cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the propynyl group is CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH). Then, step 1 adds a methyl via alkylation, making cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2, hydrogenation, would add H across the triple bond, making it cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Which is cyclohexane with a propyl group attached.

Then step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds, but in this case, the molecule is a single bond. So maybe it's not applicable. Unless there's a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the step 2 isn't hydrogenation. Wait, H2/Pd could be used for hydrogenation or perhaps for dehydrogenation? No, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, adding H2. So step 2 after alkylation would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

But if that's the case, then we don't have any double bonds, so ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't do anything. So that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene. Wait, maybe using a different catalyst. Oh, wait, if you hydrogenate a triple bond to a double bond, you use a Lindlar catalyst, which is poisoned, giving cis addition. But in the options, it's Pd without any mention of poisoning. So if you hydrogenate an alkyne with H2 and Pd, you get the cis-alkene, right? Or maybe full hydrogenation to the alkane.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst in step 2 is Pd, so it's a full hydrogenation to the single bond. Let me think: if the alkyne becomes an alkane, then in step 3, ozonolysis would have nothing to act upon. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the structure. Let me try to think again.

Another plan: the target has a formyl group (CHO), which suggests that perhaps an oxidation is involved, converting a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. So, maybe earlier steps introduce an alcohol group, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but the target also has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a cyclohexyl group and then forming the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.
2. Then, the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene.
3. Then, ozonolysis is performed to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. Then, some kind of hydroboration or oxidation forms the aldehyde and the alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me look at the options again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is CH3OH. So what would that do? Maybe forming a Grignard-like reagent. Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol as the alkylating agent? Alternatively, maybe it's a method to introduce an OMe group, but I'm not sure.

Alternative approach: Let's think about each step in each option and see which one leads us closer to the target.

Looking at the target, the molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a formyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a cyclohexyl group to the ethynylcyclohexane.
Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So perhaps the ethynyl group is being converted into a ketone or aldehyde, and then a cyclohexyl group is added via some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a methyl group via hydrogenation, then further functionalized.

Wait, another thought: The target has a formyl group, so perhaps the ethynyl group is being oxidized to a carbonyl group. How?

An alkyne can be oxidized to a ketone or carboxylic acid. For example, using strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in the options, I see O3 in some steps, which is ozonolysis.

Wait, another plan: Let's think about each option's steps.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne alkylation to make propynylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to cyclohexane with a propyl group.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination or oxidation, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration? Or maybe a hydration reaction.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation with ethyl group.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → a strong base, perhaps for elimination (like in the Birch reduction, but for alkyne perhaps).

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is used for reductions, like in the Birch reduction of aromatic rings, but for alkyne, perhaps it's used for deprotonation or for some elimination.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup after ozonolysis, perhaps to form carbonyl groups.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → propynyl group.

2. H2/Pd with CaCO3 → perhaps hydrogenation to alkane.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which would break any double bonds into carbonyls but in a reductive way.

Wait, but if the triple bond was hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So perhaps step 2 is partial hydrogenation to an alkene.

Wait, perhaps step 2 using H2 with Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that.

But if the alkyne is converted to cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But where would that happen?

Let me think: After step 1, we have propynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3). Step 2: H2/Pd → cis-alkene → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is converted to CH2-CH2, but the actual structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again: the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Upon hydrogenation to an alkene, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. The alkene would be CH2-CH2, but that's not possible. Oh wait, perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2, but in reality, it's CH2-CH2 as a double bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 would have a double bond between the two middle carbons. Wait, no, alkyne hydrogenation to an alkene would create a double bond. So if the structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, then hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would turn the triple bond into a double bond, giving cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The triple bond is between the cyclohexane carbon and the next carbon. So, the structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation (partial) would make it cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because the triple bond is between two carbons. So hydrogenation would add two Hs, making it a single bond. So propynyl becomes propyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck, so maybe it's better to think about each option's steps and see which can lead to the target.

The target has a formyl group, a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxyl and a carbon. So perhaps the steps involve introducing a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde.

Wait, another plan: The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, in the main ring (cyclohexane), the carbon 1 has both a formyl group and a substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a formyl group and a cyclohexyl group to the main ring.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So how can we get both substituents?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group via oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Ethynylcyclohexane → via some steps → cyclohexane with a ketone group → then perhaps the ketone is converted into a formyl group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process.

Wait, another thought: The target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon. So maybe the starting ethynyl group is being converted into a carbonyl group, and then a cyclohexyl group is added via some coupling.

But I'm not making progress this way. Perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps a deprotonation and alkylation with methanol. Wait, methanol is a poor electrophile, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction? No, that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a method to form an enolate or something else.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → this is a strong reducing environment. Li in NH3 is used for reductions, such as the reduction of esters to alcohols, or for the Birch reduction of aromatic rings. But in this case, maybe it's used to deprotonate something or reduce a functional group.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which would break double bonds into carbonyl groups without over-oxidizing.

4. NH4OH → ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for workup.

So, putting it together: ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's a method to introduce a methoxy group? Or perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a deprotonation to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile, so maybe it's not. Alternatively, maybe it's a method to make a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Let me consider each option's steps and what they might achieve.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl).
2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane (using H2/Pd).
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the molecule into carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the final product.

Wait, but after hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkane, there's no double bond for ozonolysis to act on. So that can't be right. So perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave that.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So let me think about option C.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → alkyne alkylation to make propynylcyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, making an alkene.

So after step 2, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but with a double bond. Wait, no, the propynyl group (CH2-C≡C-CH3) becomes CH2-CH2-CH3 after hydrogenation? No, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a double bond would give CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the middle carbons, making CH2=CH-CH3. But attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, so after step 2, we have cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the two middle carbons, making it cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. The propynyl group is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. Upon partial hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a double bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no. The starting alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH3. Upon partial hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH3 but that's not correct because after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a double bond. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH3 → but that doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a double bond (C=C), so the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 → but that's a single bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene. But I'm not making progress here.

Perhaps it's better to think that option C would involve:

After step 1: propynylcyclohexane.

Step 2: hydrogenate to alkene → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH=CH2. Then step 3: ozonolysis of the double bond.

Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form carbonyl groups. So, for CH2-CH=CH2, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups, but in this case, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if the substituent is at position 1 on the cyclohexane).

Wait, if the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between CH2 and CH2, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But wait, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere. Let me think: If the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (CH2-CH2-CH3 → CH2-CH=CH2), then ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes.

So, the product would be two aldehyde groups. But the target has only one formyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis is followed by a reductive workup. For example, using (CH3)2S as a reductant, which would convert the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones without over-oxidizing.

So, after ozonolysis, the substituent would break into two carbonyl groups. But how would that lead to the target structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is done on a different part of the molecule. But I'm getting stuck.

Another approach: let's think about the target's structure again. The main ring is cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that's a CH group attached to hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from an alkene via ozonolysis and then further reactions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclopropane opening.

Wait, maybe I should consider each option's reagents and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option C: Step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, so ozonolysis would cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups without further oxidation. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Another thought: The target has a formyl group. So perhaps in the steps, an oxidation occurs to form the aldehyde.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonation and alkylation with methanol. But methanol is not a good alkylating agent, so perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol could form the methoxide ion. Maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a method to introduce a methyl group via a substitution reaction.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is introducing a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is CH3OH. So perhaps it's a method to form a Grignard-like reagent, but I don't think so because Grignard reagents are typically made with Mg.

Wait, perhaps it's a method to perform a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halogen in the starting material.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think of what each step does.

The target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxyl. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a longer alkyne.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.
3. Perform ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups.
4. Then, perhaps perform a cyclohexane addition or some condensation to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation to propynylcyclohexane.
2. Hydrogenation to propylcyclohexane.
3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde.

But without a double bond, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C because it includes ozonolysis and steps that would introduce the formyl group.

Wait, let me try to map option C step by step.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → alkylation of the alkyne to make propynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent becomes a propyl group.

Step 3: O3 followed by (CH3)2S → but if there's no double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So perhaps step 2 is incorrect.

Alternative thought: Maybe step 2 is partial hydrogenation to an alkene. So propynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH=CH2.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But how would that form the target structure?

After ozonolysis, the substituent would be broken into two carbonyl groups, but the target has only one formyl group. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Another possibility: Maybe after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyl groups is further functionalized.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group (NaNH2, CH3Cl).
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene (H2/Pd).
3. Ozonolyse the alkene to form two carbonyls.
4. Perform a workup to form the aldehyde and another group.

But without knowing exactly, I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C because it includes ozonolysis and Ba(OH)2, which might help in forming the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because it ends with NH4OH, which could form the aldehyde.

Another approach: The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group, suggesting that an epoxide might have been opened, but I don't see any epoxidation steps in the options.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So perhaps a ring-opening of an epoxide occurred, but I don't see any steps that would form an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves a Grignard reaction, adding a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation → an ethyl group.
3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.
4. Then, some kind of addition to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not certain.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to eliminate options.

Looking at the options, option A ends with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like a Jones oxidation. So maybe after some steps, a secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone. But the target has a formyl group, which is a primary oxidation.

Option B: Uses Li and liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe a Birch reduction? But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Option C: Uses ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, so it would form aldehydes instead of ketones if possible.

Option D: Uses NaNH2 and methanol, then Li and NH3, which might be a Birch reduction.

Wait, another thought: If the target has a formyl group, perhaps an oxidation of a primary alcohol is involved. So the steps would include introducing a primary alcohol, then oxidizing it to an aldehyde.

But how to get the primary alcohol?

Perhaps through a reduction of a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve introducing a hydroxyl group via some addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to make a longer chain.
2. Hydrogenate to a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to make a carbonyl group.
4. Then, some kind of reduction to form the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the molecule is split into two parts, and one part is the formyl group, and the other part is the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diketone via ozonolysis, but I'm not certain.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should conclude that option C is the correct one because it includes ozonolysis, which can form carbonyl groups, and the other steps can lead to the target structure.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, after rethinking, perhaps the correct sequence involves:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group (NaNH2, CH3Cl).
2. Hydrogenation to an alkene (H2/Pd).
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into two carbonyls.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a substituent that is a CH group attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the terminal alkyne, converting ethynylcyclohexane into 1-propynylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Full hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane, resulting in 1-propylcyclohexane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Likely a Jones oxidation, which could oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. However, there is no clear intermediate alcohol in this sequence to explain the formation of the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylation of the terminal alkyne, converting ethynylcyclohexane into 1-butynylcyclohexane.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong reducing environment, possibly for Birch reduction or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis of a double bond to form carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis. However, the sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the target molecule, as the intermediates do not align with the required functional groups.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylation of the terminal alkyne, converting ethynylcyclohexane into 1-propynylcyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene, resulting in 1-propenylcyclohexane.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis of the double bond, followed by reductive workup, which would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups. This step could potentially form the formyl group (-CHO) in the target molecule.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used to introduce the cyclohexyl group or hydroxyl group. This sequence aligns well with the formation of the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Likely deprotonation and alkylation, but methanol is not a strong alkylating agent, making this step unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong reducing environment, possibly for Birch reduction or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis of a double bond, followed by reductive workup.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis. However, the sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the cyclohexyl group or the hydroxyl group in the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule. The alkylation step introduces a methyl group, partial hydrogenation forms an alkene, ozonolysis cleaves the double bond to form carbonyl groups, and the final step likely introduces the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

**Answer: C**
