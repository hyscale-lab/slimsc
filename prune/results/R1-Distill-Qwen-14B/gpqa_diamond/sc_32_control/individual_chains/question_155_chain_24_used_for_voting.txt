Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which makes sense because usually, when you have operators like this, the eigenstates of one are your basis for the others unless they don't commute.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. They even give the explicit form of the state as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz, which is the standard deviation of the Pz operator in this state. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔPz = sqrt(<Pz²> - <Pz>²). So I need to find the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

Wait, but Pz is given as a matrix. So, to find <Pz>, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ, and <Pz²> is ψ† (Pz)^2 ψ.

First, let me write down the matrix for Pz. From the problem statement, Pz's matrix is:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

Let me compute <Pz> first. Since Pz is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of the state squared. Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is ψ† Pz ψ. Since it's diagonal, each diagonal element is multiplied by the square of the corresponding amplitude in ψ.

So, let's compute each term:

First component: (ħ) * | -1/2 |^2 = ħ * (1/4) = ħ/4.
Second component: 0, so 0.
Third component: (-ħ) * | -1/2 |^2 = (-ħ) * (1/4) = -ħ/4.

Adding them together: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So <Pz> is zero.

Now, what about <Pz²>? Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is also diagonal, with the squares of the diagonal elements.

So Pz² matrix is:

[ (ħ)^2   0       0     ]
[ 0       0       0     ]
[ 0       0      (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ²  0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0  ħ² ]

So again, the expectation value <Pz²> is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding |amplitude|^2.

First component: (ħ²) * (1/4) = ħ²/4.
Second component: 0.
Third component: (ħ²) * (1/4) = ħ²/4.

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So <Pz²> is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔPz is the square root of [ <Pz²> - <Pz>² ].

Since <Pz> is zero, this becomes sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Oh right, because ΔPz is sqrt( <Pz²> - (<Pz>)^2 ). Since <Pz> is zero, that's just sqrt( <Pz²> ) which is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute <Pz> correctly? Because if the state is an eigenstate of Px, then the expectation values of Pz might be zero if the state is symmetric in a certain way. Let me confirm.

The state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]. Let's check normalization: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So it's normalized.

The Pz matrix has diagonal entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So when we compute <Pz>, each component is ψ_i * Pz_ii * ψ_i^*.

So for the first component: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = ħ/4.

Second component: 0.

Third component: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) )= (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = ħ/4? Wait no, wait. Pz is diagonal, so when you compute ψ† Pz ψ, it's sum_{i} ψ_i^* Pz_ii ψ_i.

So for i=1: (-1/2)^* * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/2) * ħ * (1/2) )= (1/4) ħ.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first entry is -1/2. The complex conjugate is -1/2 as it's real. Wait, no, wait: (-1/2)*Pz_11 * (-1/2) = (-1/2)*(ħ)*(-1/2) = (1/4) ħ. Similarly, third term is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2) * ħ * (1/2) = (-1/4) ħ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each term correctly.

Term 1: ψ₁ * Pz_11 * ψ₁ = (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

Term 2: ψ₂ * Pz_22 * ψ₂ = (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0.

Term3: ψ_3 * Pz_33 * ψ3 = (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) ) = (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) → Wait, no: (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (ħ/2), then multiplied by (-1/2) gives (-ħ/4). So term3 is (-ħ/4).

So total <Pz> is (1/4) ħ + 0 + (-1/4) ħ )= 0. So that's correct.

Now, <Pz²> is sum of each ψ_i² * (Pz_ii)^2.

Wait, wait. Wait, Pz squared is (Pz)^2, so each diagonal element is (Pz_ii)^2.

So for each component:

Term1: (−1/2)^2 * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) * ħ^2.

Term2: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0^2 = 1/2 * 0 = 0.

Term3: (−1/2)^2 * (−ħ)^2 = (1/4) * ħ^2.

So sum is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ^2 = (1/2) ħ^2. So <Pz²> is ħ²/2.

So uncertainty is sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

So the answer should be B) ħ/√2.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ for the given quantum state, we proceed as follows:

### Given Information
- The operator $P_z$ is represented by the diagonal matrix:
  \[
  P_z = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \hbar & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & -\hbar
  \end{bmatrix}.
  \]
- The state of the system is the column vector:
  \[
  |\psi\rangle = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  -\frac{1}{2} \\
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
  -\frac{1}{2}
  \end{bmatrix}.
  \]
- The uncertainty is calculated as:
  \[
  \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
  \]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle.
\]
Since $P_z$ is diagonal, this simplifies to:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i^* P_z^{ii} \psi_i.
\]
Substituting the values:
- For $i=1$: $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{11} = \hbar$, so $\psi_1^* P_z^{11} \psi_1 = (-\frac{1}{2})^* \hbar (-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $P_z^{22} = 0$, so $\psi_2^* P_z^{22} \psi_2 = 0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{33} = -\hbar$, so $\psi_3^* P_z^{33} \psi_3 = (-\frac{1}{2})^* (-\hbar) (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal:
\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle.
\]
Again, since $P_z^2$ is diagonal:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i^* P_z^{ii} \psi_i.
\]
Substituting the values:
- For $i=1$: $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{11} = \hbar^2$, so $\psi_1^* P_z^{11} \psi_1 = (-\frac{1}{2})^* \hbar^2 (-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $P_z^{22} = 0$, so $\psi_2^* P_z^{22} \psi_2 = 0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{33} = \hbar^2$, so $\psi_3^* P_z^{33} \psi_3 = (-\frac{1}{2})^* \hbar^2 (-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these contributions:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
