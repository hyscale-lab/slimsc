Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound. Hmm, let's see. The compound has a six-membered aromatic ring, and it's di-substituted, meaning there are two substituents attached. 

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's one thing. The IR would have a strong peak around 1700 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl. So there's definitely an ester functional group present.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. They mention six signals. Let me break that down. Two signals from aromatic-H. So there are two types of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents' positions affect the splitting of the aromatic protons. For example, if it's para-substituted, the ring might have two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Or maybe ortho or meta, but I'm not sure yet.

Then there are two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets due to coupling between adjacent CH2 groups, but wait, no. Wait, vinyl is part of a double bond, so each proton on the double bond would couple with the other. Wait, like in CH2=CH group? Or maybe in a substituent like an ester group. Oh wait, esters typically have the structure R-O-CO-R. So if the substituent is an ester, maybe it's attached to the ring as something like O-CO-O-R or perhaps an aryl ester? Or maybe it's an ester substituent like -O-CO-CH2CH3 or something.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl protons. Vinyl protons are typically in a double bond, like in an alkene. So maybe the substituent has a vinyl group. For example, an ester might have a vinyl group attached. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the substituent.

Wait, the substituent could be an ester, but let's think about how the substituents are arranged. The ring is di-substituted, so two substituents attached. One of them might be an ester group, and the other perhaps another group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So maybe each substituent has a vinyl group? Or perhaps one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, and another substituent is something else.

Wait, the NMR data says two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let me think about what that could mean.

A doublet for a vinyl proton could be because each proton is next to another proton. Like in a CH2 group attached to a double bond, but wait, vinyl protons are typically part of a double bond, so each proton in a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) would be split by the other. Wait, no, in a simple ethylene (CH2=CH2), each proton is a quartet because each is split by two neighboring protons (but actually, ethylene is a doublet of doublets, but in reality, for CH2=CH2, each proton is a quartet because each is coupled with two others). Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like maybe attached as O-CO-CH2CH2- something. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached as part of an ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and the ester is another group. Or maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that wouldn't have a vinyl group. Or perhaps it's a methyl vinyl ester, like -CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, methyl vinyl ester would be something like -CO-O-CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't introduce a vinyl group on the ring.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the total number of signals. The NMR has six signals. So it's six different types of protons.

Two aromatic protons: so maybe the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are para, but perhaps in a way that the ring has two different types of aromatic protons. Wait, no. Wait, for a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in positions that make equivalent protons. For example, para substitution would lead to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. So maybe the two substituents are in para positions, leading to two types of aromatic Hs.

Wait, the substituents could be meta or ortho. Let me think: If substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic ring would have two equivalent Hs on each of the two remaining positions, perhaps. Wait, no, para would have each substituent opposite each other, leaving the ring with two sets: two Hs on each adjacent position. Hmm, maybe the two substituents are in positions that cause two sets of aromatic Hs.

Alternatively, the substituents could be in such a way that the ring has two distinct types of Hs, each with two Hs each. So that accounts for two signals in NMR, each with integration for two Hs.

Then, the vinyl Hs: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So, perhaps a group where each vinyl H is coupled to another H. For example, in a CH2-CH2 group, but that's not vinyl. Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So each CH2 in the double bond would have two Hs. But in a double bond, each H is coupled to one other H, so each would be a doublet. Hmm, but in that case, maybe each vinyl H is part of a CH2 group attached to another CH2, but that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-... something. Or maybe it's an ester group with a vinyl substituent.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So if the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R attached to the ring, then R could be a vinyl group. So R could be CH2CH2-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, R is an alkoxy group. Alternatively, R could be a vinyl group, like CH2CH2- attached to the ester.

Wait, let me think: if the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, and R is CH2=CH- something. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester, where the ester is part of a vinyl group. For example, an ester where the R group is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other NMR signals. There are two signals for CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. No signals for CH2 groups, so all methyl groups are not adjacent to another CH2.

So maybe the substituents include ester groups and some methyl groups. Let's think about possible structures.

Let me think of a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group. For example, the substituents could be an ester and a vinyl group. But wait, the ester substituent itself may have a methyl group. For example, methyl ester: -COOCH3. Wait, but then the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3 attached to the ring. Then that's a substituent without any CH2 groups. But the NMR shows signals for two CH3 groups.

Wait, so let's consider that. If one substituent is an ester, say methyl ester, then the ester would have a CH3 group. But where's the other CH3 group? Maybe the other substituent is a methyl group or another group with a CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, the ester could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

So the formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

Assuming it's a di-substituted benzene ring, which has 6 carbons. So the substituents must account for the remaining carbons.

Ester groups have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So the substituent is an ester group, which would contribute O and carbons.

So let's see: the ring has 6 C. The substituents are two groups, each of which may have multiple carbons.

Wait, but the problem says it's di-substituted, which means two substituents. So each substituent adds to the count.

For example, if each substituent is an ester group, but that would complicate, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group with a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is an ethyl group, but that wouldn't account for the vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R attached to the ring. Then, that substituent would have some CH2 groups, but the problem states there are no CH2 groups in the NMR. Wait, no, the NMR shows no signals for CH2 groups, meaning the molecule doesn't have any CH2 groups. So any substituent with -CH2- would be a problem.

Wait, but the substituent could be a CH3 group, but that would only add a CH3, not a CH2.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for methyl groups. So two different types of methyl groups.

So perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group. Let's see.

Ester group: O-CO-O-R. R could be something like CH3 or another group.

Wait, for example, if one substituent is an ester, say, methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached as a substituent, like CH2=CH-. But CH2=CH- would have H's on the double bond. Wait, but the substituent would be CH2=CH2 attached to the ring? No, that's not possible because CH2=CH2 is ethene, which can't be attached directly without a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methylenedioxy group or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl ester and a methyl group. So, the ring has two substituents: one is a vinyl ester, and the other is a methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the structure. For example, the ring could have an ester group, say, -O-CO-OCH2CH3 and another substituent as CH3. No, wait, that would have a CH2 group in the ester, which would show a CH2 in the NMR. But the NMR doesn't have any CH2 signals, so that's a problem.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. Like, the substituent is -O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But that would have a CH2 group, so I can't have that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl ester or something without CH2 groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester where R is a vinyl group. Like, O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3? No, that has CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group (CH3) and a vinyl ester group. But then the vinyl ester would have a CH2 group, which is a problem.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group as part of the ring. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at the possible molecular formulas.

The molecule is a di-substituted benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents.

Each substituent adds some carbons.

We have ester groups, which are O-CO-O-R. So each ester substituent would have, say, R as a methyl (CH3) or ethyl (CH2CH3) group.

But since the NMR shows two methyl groups, perhaps each substituent adds a methyl group.

Wait, but the ring has two substituents. So maybe one substituent is a methyl group (CH3), and the other is an ester group which includes another methyl. For example, the ester could be O-CO-OCH3.

So substituent 1: CH3.

Substituent 2: O-CO-OCH3.

Wait, but then the substituents are two different groups: the methyl and the methyl ester.

Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. So the total formula would be benzene (6 C) + substituents.

Substituent 1: CH3 (1 C) and substituent 2: O-CO-OCH3 (which is 1 C for the ester group and the O's, but the R is CH3, so that adds another C.

Wait, wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, so R is CH3. So substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH3. That's 2 O's and the R is CH3.

So the substituents contribute 1 C (from CH3) and 2 C (from O-CO-OCH3? No, O-CO-OCH3: the COO is part of the substituent. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 O's? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is CH3. So substituent is O-CO-OCH3. So substituent 2 is one substituent with 3 O's? Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, so that's the ester. So substituent 2 is the ester group, which contributes 3 O's? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, which is two O's in the ester linkage. So substituent 2 is O-CO-O-R, R=CH3.

So substituent 1 is CH3, substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH3.

Then, total carbons: benzene (6) + substituent 1 (1 CH3) + substituent 2 (3 carbons: O-CO-OCH3 has the O's but the carbons are 3? Wait, the substituent O-CO-OCH3 would be O-C-O-CH3, which is two carbons in the ester group (the COO) and then the CH3. So substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons: the C from COO, the O, and the CH3. Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, so the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 1 C in the COO (the carbonyl C) and then two more in the OCH3 (CH3 is one C). Wait, no, OCH3 is one C. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons: the COO group (which is two carbons) and the CH3 (one C). Wait, no, the COO is part of the substituent. So substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH3. So that's two carbons in the ester (the COO) and one in the OCH3. So substituent 2 is three carbons? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-O-R, where R is CH3. So substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH3, which has two carbons: the carbonyl C and the OCH3 (which is one C). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count all the carbons. Let's think: benzene is 6 C.

Substituent 1: CH3 → 1 C.

Substituent 2: O-CO-OCH3 → the group itself is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 C: the carbonyl C (from COO), the two O's, and the CH3. So perhaps substituent 2 adds 3 C.

Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. The COO group is part of the substituent. So substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 C in total? The COO has one C (the carbonyl C) and the OCH3 has another C, so substituent 2 is 2 C. So total C from substituents would be 1 (from CH3) + 2 (from O-CO-OCH3) = 3 C. So benzene (6) + substituents (3) = 9 C. But the options have 11 or 12 C. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps each substituent adds more carbons. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is not just a simple methyl ester. Maybe it's a vinyl ester, which adds more carbons.

For example, substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. Then substituent 2 adds 3 C (CH2CH2CH3). So substituent 1 is CH3 (1 C), substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (with 3 C in the R group). So substituent 2 adds 3 C.

So total C: 6 (benzene) + 1 (CH3) + 3 (R group) = 10 C. But the options are 11 or 12, so that's not matching either.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are more complex. Maybe one substituent is an ester group with more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. Like, substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3, which would add a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenoate ester, which would have a double bond (so vinyl Hs) and a methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals again. There are two vinyl Hs: one doublet, one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group as part of the ester. For example, substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would have CH2 groups which are not allowed because the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. Then, the ester group would have a CH2CH3 group. But that would introduce a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't have. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a methyl group (CH3), which would contribute a CH3 signal. Then substituent 1 is an ester group which includes a vinyl group and another CH3.

Wait, but then the ester substituent would have a vinyl group and a methyl group. Let's say substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. No, that has CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Then, the ester has a vinyl group. So substituent 1 would be O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. That would have a vinyl group (CH2CH=CH2). But that introduces CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH-O-R. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that brings in CH2 groups which are a no-go.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another angle. Let's count the number of H in each substituent.

The NMR shows 2 signals for methyl groups. So 2 CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3 H, but in the NMR, the integration would be 3 for each.

The aromatic Hs are 2 signals, each with 2 H, perhaps. So 2 × 2 H = 4 H.

The vinyl Hs are 2 signals. Let's think: each vinyl H is in a double bond. For example, substituent 1 is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-. But that would have 2 H. Wait, each vinyl group has two H's. So if substituent 1 is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, then that contributes 2 H. But the NMR says two signals for vinyl Hs, each with 2 H.

Wait, no. Let me think: the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. So the substituent is a vinyl ester. So the vinyl group is in the substituent. So the substituent would have two H's on the double bond.

So for that, the substituent would have two H's, each as a doublet because each is coupled with the other. So in the NMR, that would be a doublet, maybe. But the NMR shows two signals for vinyl Hs: one a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to another group. For example, substituent 1 is CH2=CH-R, where R is another group. But if R is part of an ester, then substituent 1 is part of the ester.

So substituent 1 could be O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But that brings CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Then the substituent has a CH2 group, which is again a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or something else, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe one of the substituents is a vinyl group and the other is an ester. But then the ester would have a CH3 group, and the vinyl group would have a CH2 group, which is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropyl group attached to the ester. But this is getting too speculative.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester, and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to another ester. But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think about the molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The molecular formula is CnHmO2.

The di-substituted benzene has 6 C. So substituents must contribute (n-6) C.

If the formula is C11H14O2 (option A), substituents contribute 5 C.

If it's C11H12O2 (option D), substituents contribute 5 C.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the ester group. An ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are substituents. The ester contributes 2 O's.

In our case, the compound has O2. So the ester is part of the structure.

So, the substituents must be:

Substituent 1: R-O-

Substituent 2: R'-CO-O-

Wait, no, probably substituent 1 is an ester group, as in -O-CO-O-R.

Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-O-R. So if one substituent is O-CO-O-R, then that's one substituent. The other substituent is something else, perhaps a methyl group.

So substituent 1: O-CO-O-R (ester group), which contributes (number of C in R + 2 (COO) + 1 (O) ).

So substituent 1: if R is CH3 (methyl), then substituent is O-CO-OCH3. So substituent 1 is 3 C (COO and CH3). So substituent 1 contributes 3 C.

Substituent 2: another group, perhaps a methyl group (CH3), which contributes 1 C.

So total C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (substituent 1) + 1 (substituent 2) = 10 C. But none of the options have 10 C. So perhaps this is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-R, where R is ethyl (CH2CH3). Then substituent 1 would have 3 C in the R group (CH2CH3) plus the COO group (2 C). So substituent 1 is 3 + 2 = 5 C?

Wait, no. The substituent is O-CO-O-R. So R is CH2CH3, which is 2 C. So substituent 1 has 2 (from R) + 2 (COO) = 4 C. So substituent 1 contributes 4 C.

Substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C). So total C: 6 +4 +1=11 C. So the formula would be C11H...O2.

Looking at the options, that's option A (C11H14O2) or D (C11H12O2).

Now, let's think about the H counts.

Benzene has 6 C, but in a di-substituted ring, the number of H depends on substitution. For example, if it's para-substituted, the ring has 4 H. If it's meta, perhaps 4 H. Ortho could have 4 H as well. Wait, no, for para substitution, the ring would have two H on each of the two remaining C, so 4 H.

So aromatic Hs: 4.

Substituents: substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So substituent 1 is ethyl ester. So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH2CH3. It's connected to the ring via the oxygen. So substituent 1 has a CH2CH3 group. So substituent 1 contributes 2 H (from CH2CH3) and perhaps some other H.

Wait, the ester group O-CO-OCH2CH3 would have the ethyl group, which has 2 CH2 groups. But wait, the substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the O is connected to the benzene, then the COO, then OCH2CH3. The OCH2CH3 is an ethyl group attached to oxygen. So the substituent adds ethyl group, which has two CH2 groups. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, so that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, same issue.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester). Then substituent 1 contributes CH3 group, so 3 H. Substituent 2 is CH3, which contributes another 3 H.

So substituent 1: 3 H (from CH3), substituent 2: 3 H (from CH3). 

Aromatic Hs: 4.

Plus the substituent 1's CH3: 3 H, substituent 2's CH3: 3 H.

But wait, the NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. So the substituents are two different methyl groups. So substituent 1's methyl and substituent 2's methyl.

Wait, but how can substituent 2 be a methyl group if substituent 1 is an ester? Because substituent 2 would be a methyl attached to the ring, and substituent 1 is an ester.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester: 3 C, 3 H)

Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C, 3 H)

So substituent 1's CH3: 3 H, substituent 2's CH3:3 H.

So total H from substituents: 6.

Aromatic Hs: 4.

Vinyl Hs: let's say substituent 1 has a vinyl group. No, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3, which doesn't have a vinyl group. So where do the vinyl Hs come from?

Ah, maybe substituent 2 is a vinyl group. Substituent 2 is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But then substituent 2 would be CH2=CH-, which has two H's on the double bond. But that would introduce a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't have.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached as part of an ester. Like substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but then that has CH2 groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached as part of the ester. Let's think of substituent 1 as O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But that brings in CH2 groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the substituent has a double bond adjacent to the ester group without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's a longer chain and has CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH3 and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H, no CH2 groups)

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But that would bring in CH2 groups, which is a problem.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe substituent 2 is a methylene group, but that's CH2, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe the substituent 2 is a methyl group and substituent 1 is a vinyl ester.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Then substituent 1 has a vinyl group.

But substituent 1 would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH-O-R, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a propenoate ester, which is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But that again brings in CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molecular formula again.

If the formula is C11H12O2 (option D), then the degrees of unsaturation can be calculated.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

Which includes:

- Benzene ring: 4 degrees (3 double bonds in the ring)

- Ester group: 1 double bond (C=O)

- Any double bonds in substituents: perhaps the vinyl group is another double bond.

So 4 (benzene) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl) =6, which fits.

So that's possible.

So the formula would be C11H12O2 (option D). Let's see.

But wait, what about the NMR signals.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H) and substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C, 3 H), then that's 2 CH3 signals.

Aromatic Hs: 4 H, split into two signals of 2 H each.

Vinyl Hs: from a substituent with a double bond. But in this scenario, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3, which doesn't have a double bond. So where are the vinyl Hs coming from?

Ah, perhaps the substituent 2 is a vinyl group. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But then that would introduce CH2 groups, which are not allowed. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, but that brings CH2 groups.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't have any CH2 signals, so substituent can't have any CH2 groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is a propenoate ester, which has a double bond and no CH2 groups. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. No, that has CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. No, that has CH2 groups.

Hmm.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of a structure that fits all the data.

The structure has:

- A benzene ring with two substituents.

- An ester group (so substituent is O-CO-O-R).

- Two CH3 groups (so R must have at least two CH3 groups, or maybe one substituent has a CH3 and another substituent has another CH3).

Wait, but substituent 1 is O-CO-O-R. If R is CH3, substituent 1 has a CH3. Substituent 2 is another group with a CH3.

But substituent 2 is another substituent on the benzene. If substituent 2 is CH3, then that's another CH3 group.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C: O-CO-OCH3, 3 H)

Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C, 3 H)

So substituent 1 contributes 3 C, substituent 2 contributes 1 C. Benzene is 6 C. Total C: 6+3+1=10 C. But options don't have 10 C. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So substituent 1 is ethyl ester. That would have 3 C in the substituent (O-CO-OCH2CH3: O, COO has two C, and CH2CH3 has two C). So substituent 1 contributes 4 C.

Substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

Total C: 6 +4 +1= 11 C.

So formula would be C11H?O2.

But substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3. That substituent has 2 CH2 groups. So the ethyl group is CH2CH3. So the substituent 1 would have two CH2 groups, which are not allowed because the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that's a problem.

Hmm, but the NMR shows no CH2 signals. So substituent 1 can't have any CH2 groups.

So substituent 1 must be a methyl ester, O-CO-OCH3.

Substituent 2: another group with a CH3 and perhaps a vinyl group.

But substituent 2 can't have any CH2 groups.

So substituent 2 could be a vinyl methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond. Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propargyl group, but that's a triple bond and not a double bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring. So substituent 2 is =CH2 attached to the ring as a substituent. But that's not possible, as the substituent would be a single bond. So the only way is to have a double bond in the substituent.

So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a methylene group (CH2-) attached to the ring. But that's a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the substituent includes a benzene ring, but that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent 2 is a vinyl group as part of the ester. So substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But then substituent 1 has CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl Hs. So perhaps the substituent 1 is a vinyl group, and substituent 2 is an ester.

Wait, substituent 1 is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. Substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH3. 

So substituent 1: CH2=CH- (but that has CH2 groups, which are not allowed).

Hmm.

I think I need to make a decision here. Let me try to think about the possible structures that fit the NMR.

The NMR has:

- 2 aromatic signals (probably two sets of two H each)

- 2 vinyl H signals (maybe each is a doublet or something else)

- 2 CH3 signals (two different methyl groups).

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a vinyl group attached as part of another ester.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But that brings CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH-OCH3. No, that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and another substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring via a double bond. But that's not possible because double bonds can't be directly attached to a benzene ring without being part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methylenedioxy group. But that's another story.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen, like O-CH2-CH2-O, but that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of the possible structures based on the molecular formula.

Option D is C11H12O2.

Which would have 11 C. Benzene is 6 C, so substituents contribute 5 C.

Substituent 1: O-CO-O-R (ester group) → R could be CH2CH3 (ethyl), which is 2 C. So substituent 1: 3 C (COO) + 2 C (ethyl) = 5 C. Substituent 2: nothing, but wait, it's di-substituted, so substituent 2 must be another group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which is 4 C (COO plus ethyl). Substituent 2 is another group.

Wait, but substituent 2 would have to contribute the remaining 1 C (since 6 +4 +1=11). So substituent 2 could be a methyl group (CH3). So substituent 2 is CH3.

So substituents: O-CO-OCH2CH3 (4 C), CH3 (1 C). So total C: 6+4+1=11.

But substituent 1 has an ethyl group (CH2CH3), which has CH2 groups. The NMR doesn't show any CH2 groups, which would be a problem.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester: 3 C) and substituent 2 is CH2CH2CH3, but that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester: substituent has 3 C in the R group, plus COO (2 C) → total 5 C). Substituent 2 is nothing? No, it's di-substituted, so substituent 2 must contribute another C. Wait, no, substituent 1 would then be 5 C, and substituent 2 is another group, say, CH3 (1 C). So total C:6+5+1=12, which would make the formula C12H...O2. Let's check.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), substituent 2 is CH3.

So substituent 1 contributes 5 C (COO plus propyl), substituent 2 1 C.

Total C:6+5+1=12. So formula would be C12H...O2.

So which option is that? Option B is C12H14O2, and option C is C12H12O2.

Now, considering the H count.

Benzene: di-substituted, so 4 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

- The substituent has a propyl group: CH2CH2CH3. So that's two CH2 groups (each with 2 H) and a CH3 (3 H).

But the NMR has no CH2 signals. So that's a problem.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2. But that's getting too complex and brings more CH2 groups.

I think I'm missing something here. Let me try another approach.

The presence of a vinyl group (from the NMR) suggests a double bond. So the molecular formula must have a double bond.

In the structure, we have the benzene ring (already a lot of double bonds), the ester's C=O, and perhaps a vinyl group (another double bond).

So the degrees of unsaturation would be (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2.

If the formula is C11H12O2:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

Which would be 3 double bonds (benzene has 3) + 1 (ester C=O) + 2 (vinyl double bond?), but no, that would be 5. Wait, maybe the vinyl group is one double bond.

Wait, benzene ring (3 double bonds) + ester C=O (1) + vinyl double bond (1) → total 5. So formula should have 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, formula with 5 degrees would have: 2C +2 - H - X + N = 10.

Wait, for C11H12O2:

(2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees of unsaturation.

Which includes: benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1), and another double bond? Or maybe a ring plus a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me think again. The benzene ring contributes 4 degrees (as it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds). The ester contributes one more. The vinyl group contributes one more. So total 6 degrees.

So that's correct.

So for the formula C11H12O2, the structure would have a benzene ring, an ester group, and a vinyl group.

So substituent 1: O-CO-O-R, where R includes a vinyl group.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-R, and R has a vinyl group.

For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But that would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH-O-R. No, still CH2 groups.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps R is a benzyl group, but that's another aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, but that brings CH2 groups, which is a problem.

But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, so substituent 1 cannot have any CH2 groups.

Wait, unless the substituent is a vinyl group without any CH2.

Hmm.

Another possibility: substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH3 (methyl ester), and substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to another ester.

Wait, substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. No, that's CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH=CH2. So substituent 2 is a vinyl ester.

So substituent 2 would be O-CO-O-CH=CH2. That's a vinyl group attached to the ester.

So substituent 2 would be O-CO-O-CH=CH2, which has a CH=CH2 group.

So substituent 2: O-CO-O-CH=CH2.

So substituent 2 has a double bond, so the vinyl Hs would be from the CH2=CH- part.

So substituent 2 would contribute two H's on the double bond, split into signals.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H, no CH2)

Substituent 2: O-CO-O-CH=CH2 (4 C: COO, O, CH=CH2 (2 C), so substituent 2 is 4 C)

So substituents contribute 3 +4=7 C. Benzene is 6 C, so total C:6+7=13. That's higher than the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is O-CO-O-CH=CH-O-R. No, that's getting too complicated.

I think I need to make a choice based on the information.

The options are either C11H14O2, C11H12O2, etc.

The NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two methyl.

The ester is present.

No CH2 groups.

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents:

- One substituent is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3)

- The other substituent is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen as part of a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both esters, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two ester groups, but that would mean more O's, but the formula has only O2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a vinyl group and another is an ester with a methyl.

So substituent 1: CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that gets CH2 groups.

Wait, substituent 1 is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. R is CH3. So substituent 1 is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3.

Wait, that would have substituent 1 as CH2CH=CH-O-CO-OCH3.

No, that's getting too complicated and brings CH2 groups.

I think I'll have to go with option D: C11H12O2, because the degrees of unsaturation match and it has enough carbons.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, option B is C12H14O2.

Wait, for option B: C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

Which includes benzene (4), ester (1), vinyl (1).

So that's possible.

But how would the substituents look?

Substituent 1: O-CO-O-R, where R is longer.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), substituent 2 is CH3.

So substituent 1 has 3 C (COO) + 3 C (propyl) = 6 C.

Substituent 2: 1 C (CH3).

Total C:6+6+1=13, which is higher than option B's 12.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester: 4 C), substituent 2 is CH2CH3 (another ethyl group). But that would have CH2 groups, which are forbidden.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C), substituent 2 is another group contributing 3 C.

So substituent 2 could be CH2CH2CH3 (propyl), but that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Considering all this, I think the correct formula is C11H14O2, which is option A.

Wait, but let's think about the H count.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 H), substituent 2 is CH3 (3 H). Aromatic Hs:4.

Vinyl Hs:2 H.

Total H: 3+3+4+2=12. But option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H.

But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. So 2 H from vinyl groups.

So 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (CH3 groups) = 12 H.

Which matches option D: C11H12O2.

So the formula must be C11H12O2, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR data. The compound is a six-membered aromatic ring with two substituents, and the FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl protons. There are no signals corresponding to CH2 groups.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group is confirmed by the strong absorption peak around 1700 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals suggest the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of equivalent protons, likely due to the substituents' positions (e.g., para substitution).
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) indicate the presence of a vinyl group (C=C) with two protons.
   - **Methyl Protons**: Two signals correspond to two different methyl groups (CH3).
   - **No CH2 Signals**: The absence of CH2 groups in the NMR spectrum implies that the substituents do not contain CH2 groups.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - The compound is a di-substituted benzene (6 carbons) with two substituents contributing additional carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens.
   - The degrees of unsaturation for each option were calculated to match the expected structure:
     - **C11H12O2**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6 (benzene ring: 4, ester C=O: 1, vinyl C=C: 1).
     - **C11H14O2**: Degrees of unsaturation = 5 (benzene ring: 4, ester C=O: 1).
     - **C12H12O2**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7 (benzene ring: 4, ester C=O: 1, vinyl C=C: 1, additional unsaturation: 1).
     - **C12H14O2**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6 (benzene ring: 4, ester C=O: 1, vinyl C=C: 1).

4. **Structural Considerations**:
   - The ester group contributes two oxygens and a carbonyl group.
   - The vinyl group contributes two protons and a double bond.
   - The two methyl groups account for the two CH3 signals in the NMR.
   - The absence of CH2 signals implies that the substituents do not contain CH2 groups.

5. **Final Formula Selection**:
   - **C11H12O2** matches the NMR data and degrees of unsaturation. The structure likely includes a benzene ring with two substituents: one methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and one vinyl group. This accounts for the two methyl signals, two aromatic signals, and two vinyl signals in the NMR spectrum.
   - **C11H14O2**, **C12H12O2**, and **C12H14O2** do not align as well with the NMR data, particularly the absence of CH2 signals and the presence of two distinct methyl groups.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is **C11H12O2**.
