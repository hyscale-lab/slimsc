Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and determining if the theory is renormalizable. Let's break it down.

The Lagrangian is given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices.

First, I think I need to determine the mass dimension of each field and the coupling constant. Because in quantum field theory, the mass dimension helps us figure out renormalizability. If the coupling's dimension is positive, the theory might not be renormalizable because higher-order terms could cause problems.

Let's list out the fields involved:

- ψ is a Dirac spinor. I remember that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, and the action has to be dimensionless. So each ψ brings 3/2.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. F is derived from a gauge field A, which in 4D has mass dimension 1. The field strength tensor F is the derivative of A plus the commutator, so I think each F has dimension 2. Because A has dimension 1, so ∂μ Aν has dimension 2, and thus F^{μν} is also dimension 2.

Now, the other part is σ_{μν}. Since σ is made of the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they're just matrices), σ_{μν} doesn't contribute any mass dimension. So the term σ_{μν} doesn't change the dimension here.

Putting it all together, the Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's compute the mass dimension of each part.

The ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2, so together that's 3. F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 =5. But wait, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over spacetime, the action is dimensionless. So the Lagrangian density itself has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime.

So the term L_int = κ [ψ̄ σ ψ F]. The [ψ̄ σ ψ F] part has dimension 5, right? Because 3/2 + 3/2 (from ψ̄ and ψ) is 3, and F is 2, so total 5. So the entire term, including κ, must have dimension 4. So [κ] + 5 =4. Solving for κ's dimension: [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would point me towards options A or C, since those have [κ]=-1.

Next, determining whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories have all coupling constants with non-positive mass dimensions. Wait, I think I remember that a coupling with mass dimension d is allowed as long as d ≥ 0, but wait, no. Wait, wait, the renormalizability depends on the maximum superficial degree of divergence. Alternatively, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Wait, no, I think I'm getting it mixed up.

Wait, another approach: the dimension of the coupling constant determines the renormalizability. If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the interaction term is "more relevant" but that's not directly helpful. Wait, the rule I remember is that a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have a mass dimension ≤4 in 4D spacetime. Wait, no, maybe that's not it. Or perhaps a theory is renormalizable only if all couplings have a mass dimension ≥0.

Wait, no, let me think again. Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for each interaction term, the coupling must have a dimension such that when multiplied by the fields, the total is 4.

If the coupling has a negative mass dimension, then in higher loops, the coupling gets multiplied by higher powers of the energy scale. So if [κ] is negative, say -d, then when you have a Feynman diagram with L loops, the coupling would be multiplied by (E)^d L. So for high energies (UV limit), this could become a problem, making the theory non-renormalizable. 

Wait, no, another perspective. The mass dimension of the coupling is [κ] = 4 - sum of the field dimensions. For a renormalizable theory, each coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0. Because if it's negative, the interaction term becomes more relevant as you go to lower energies, but for high energies, the coupling becomes stronger. But for renormalizability, the coupling should have dimension ≤ the number of fields minus 4? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The interaction term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The dimension of L_int is 4. The product of the fields is (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) )= (3/2 + 3/2 + 2) = 3 +2=5. So [κ] =4 -5= -1.

In terms of renormalizability: the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0, right? Because if the coupling has a negative dimension, that would imply that the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Because when you write the Feynman diagrams, each vertex would bring in a factor of κ, and higher loops would involve higher powers of the coupling. If κ has negative mass dimension, then in the UV (high energy), the coupling becomes large, leading to non-perturbative effects and making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, wait. Let me remember the general rule. In 4 dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling is ≥0. Because the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian must be 4 (since integrating d^4x makes the action dimensionless). So, in a term like L = g φ^n, the dimension is [g] =4 - n*(dim φ). For φ being a scalar with dim 1, [g] =4 -n*1. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0, so 4 -n ≥0 → n ≤4. That's why φ^3 and φ^4 are renormalizable, but φ^5 is not.

In our case, the coupling κ has [κ]=-1. That's negative. So the term in the Lagrangian with κ would be non-renormalizable. Because [κ] < 0. So the theory isn't renormalizable.

So putting it together, [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, that's option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \) in 4-dimensional spacetime.
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has mass dimension \( 1 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \)
The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) in the Lagrangian has the following mass dimensions:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) and \( \psi \) contribute \( \frac{3}{2} \) each, so their combined dimension is \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) contributes \( 2 \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it does not contribute to the mass dimension.

Thus, the total mass dimension of \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension \( 4 \) in 4-dimensional spacetime, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must satisfy:

\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the interaction term becomes more significant at higher energy scales, leading to non-renormalizable divergences. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
