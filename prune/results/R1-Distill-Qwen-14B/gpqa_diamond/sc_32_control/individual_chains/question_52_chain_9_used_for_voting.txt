Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through what's being asked.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star has dark spots covering 40% of its surface, its effective temperature changes. Then, there's something about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels, and how this ratio changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The options give possible factors by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that in stars, the photosphere's temperature affects the ionization and excitation states of atoms. I think this has to do with the Saha equation, which describes the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere under LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium). Oh right, the Saha equation relates the number of ions to the electron density and temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of two energy levels of neutral Ti. Oh, right, when atoms are neutral, their populations in different energy levels are governed by the Boltzmann equation, which depends on temperature.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n_i / n_j) is equal to (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the transition is between two levels with a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I'm not sure if that affects much, but perhaps it's just to say that the energy difference is related to the photon's energy. E = hc/λ, so λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near UV or far UV range, I think.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio is (n1)/(n2). When the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. Wait, but is the temperature of the photosphere as a whole dropping because spots are cooler, or is the effective temperature dropping?

Wait, the Teff is given as 6000 K without spots, and 5500 K with 40% spots. But the effective temperature is the average, but the actual photospheric temperature might vary. Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature decreases. So the photosphere's overall T is lower when spots are present.

But wait, the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff drops. Hmm, but the photosphere might have a lower effective temperature when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower, which affects the populations of the energy levels.

So, the problem is about the ratio n1/n2, which depends on temperature. Let me think about how temperature affects this ratio. The ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, because if E_i is higher than E_j, then as T increases, exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) becomes larger because the denominator is bigger, so the exponent becomes less negative. So if E2 > E1, then when T increases, n2/n1 would increase because the exponential becomes larger.

But wait, the ratio given is n1/n2. So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So the exponential is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE = E2-E1. So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( ΔE/(k T) ). Wait, no:

Wait, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1} ?

Wait, no, let's get the Boltzmann equation right. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

So if E_i > E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so the exponential is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), which is a small number. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases. So n_i/n_j would increase if E_i > E_j and T increases.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. So when T is lower, what happens to the ratio n1/n2?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, the question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (normal state) compared to when it has spots. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Wait, the ratio when there are spots is lower than when there are no spots. So the ratio without spots is higher, so the factor is (ratio without)/(ratio with) = something greater than 1.

So the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes—so we calculate (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is the factor by which the ratio increases when there are no spots versus when spots are present.

So we need to find this factor.

But to find this, we can model the ratio with and without spots.

But wait, what is the relation between the effective temperature (Teff) and the photospheric temperature? The problem says that when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the photospheric effective temperature is lower when spots are present.

But in the photosphere, each part has its own temperature. So when spots are present, 40% of the surface is spots with lower Teff, and the rest is at 6000 K. But the average Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem says to assume the stellar photosphere is in LTE. So perhaps we can model the overall effect on the photosphere by considering the average temperature. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that with spots, the average T of the photosphere is 5500 K, whereas without spots it's 6000 K.

Wait, but the actual photosphere is perhaps a mix of hot and cool regions. But the question is about the LTE assumption, so perhaps each region is in LTE, but the overall observed ratio is a combination.

Wait, this could complicate things. Because when spots are present, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

But the effective temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered. So maybe we can compute the average T.

Wait, but the effective temperature is related to the flux. The flux is sigma * Teff^4. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from each region.

So let's model the star as having two regions: 60% with T1 = 6000 K, and 40% with T_spot. The average Teff is T_eff_avg =5500 K.

The total flux would be the sum of fluxes from each region, weighted by their area.

Flux from a region is sigma * T^4 * area.

So the average flux (so that Teff is the effective temperature) is:

T_eff_avg^4 = (0.6 * T1^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4)

We can solve for T_spot.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

T_eff_avg = 5500 K.

0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = (5500)^4

Hmm, let me compute each term.

First compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4: 5.5e3^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12. 5.5^4 is 5.5 *5.5=30.25; 30.25 *5.5=166.375; 166.375 *5.5 ≈ 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So,

0.6 * 1.296e15 + 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Compute 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So 7.776e14 + 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract: 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

So 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14.

Divide both sides by 0.4: T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14)/0.4 ≈ 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root: T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. Let me take natural logs.

ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14) ≈ 1.236 + 32.236 ≈ 33.472.

Divide by 4: 8.368. Exponentiate: e^8.368 ≈ e^8 is 2980, e^0.368 is about 1.445. So 2980 * 1.445 ≈ 4295 K.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12= 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15. Yes.

5500^4: 5500 =5.5e3, so (5.5)^4 = (5.5 *5.5)=30.25; 30.25 *5.5=166.375; *5.5=915.0625. So 5.5^4 =915.0625, so 5.5e3^4=915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14. Correct.

So 0.6 *1.296e15 = 0.6 * 1.296 =0.7776, so 0.7776e15 =7.776e14.

Then, 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 =1.374625e14.

Divide by 0.4: 1.374625e14 /0.4=3.4365625e14.

Fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Hmm, 3.4365625e14 is 3.4365625 * 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = 1e3.5= about 3162.27766.

The fourth root of 3.4365625 is about (3.4365625)^(1/4). Let's compute that.

What's 3.4365625^0.25.

We know that 1^0.25=1, 2^0.25≈1.189, 3^0.25≈1.316, 4^0.25=1.414.

Wait, 3.436 is between 3 and 4. Let me approximate.

What is 1.34^4: 1.34^2=1.7956; squared again: ~3.225. Hmm, 1.35^4: (1.35^2)^2= (1.8225)^2 ≈3.3208. 1.36^2=1.8496; squared is about 3.420. So 1.36^4≈3.420. Close to our 3.436.

So 3.436 is about 1.36^4. So, the fourth root is approximately 1.36.

So the fourth root of 3.4365625e14 is 1.36 * (1e14)^(1/4) = 1.36 * 3162.27766 ≈ 1.36 * 3e3 ≈ 4080 K.

So T_spot ≈4080 K.

So the spots are at around 4080 K, and the rest of the surface is 6000 K. But the effective temperature is 5500 K.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The photosphere is in LTE, so each region (spot and non-spot) would have its own levels populated according to their respective temperatures.

But wait, when the star has spots, the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, but the actual regions have different temperatures.

But how does this affect the observed ratio of Ti levels?

Wait, the observed ratio would be a combination of the Ti ratios from the different regions, weighted by their emission.

Hmm, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the problem is simplifying and treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the star's photosphere is, on average, at 5500 K when spots are present. But I'm not sure. The question could be ambiguous here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K, so the temperatures of the different regions are not considered, but the average is taken.

Wait, the problem states that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti atoms, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the entire photosphere is taken as at 5500 K when spots are present.

So, with that assumption, without spots, T =6000 K, with spots, T=5500 K.

Then, the ratio of n1/n2 depends on T. So the ratio when no spots is (n1/n2)_6000, and when spots are present, it's (n1/n2)_5500.

We need to find the factor (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But wait, from the question, when spots are present, the ratio decreases, so (n1/n2)_5500 < (n1/n2)_6000. Thus, the factor is greater than 1.

So, the factor is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_5500) ) ].

The (g1/g2) cancels out, so the factor is exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_6000 - 1/T_5500) ) ].

Wait, let me think about the exponents. From the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong earlier. Let's correct that.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

Assuming E2 > E1, so E_i = E2, E_j = E1.

So, (E2-E1) is positive.

So, without spots, T = 6000 K. With spots, T =5500 K.

The ratio (n1/n2) without spots: R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000) )

The ratio (n1/n2) with spots: R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )

So the factor we want is R1/R2 = [exp( -(ΔE)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -(ΔE)/(k*5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ -(ΔE)/(k*6000) + (ΔE)/(k*5500) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000≈0.000166667.

So 1/5500 - 1/6000 ≈ 0.000015151.

So, the exponent is (ΔE)/(k) * 0.000015151.

Now, we need to compute ΔE.

ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, which corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å.

ΔE = hc / λ

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), λ=1448 Å =1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) ) J.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J.

Compute 1.9878 /1448 ≈ 0.001373.

So ΔE ≈ 0.001373e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, maybe it's easier to compute in terms of eV, since 1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So,

ΔE = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, wait, let me recompute:

Wait, 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.373 / 1.602) * 10 eV ≈ (0.857) *10 = 8.57 eV.

Wait, but wait, 1e-18 /1.6e-19 is (1e-18)/(1.6e-19) )= 10/(1.6) ≈6.25.

Wait, wait, 1e-18 is 10 *1e-19. So 1.37e-18 / 1.6e-19 = (1.37 /1.6 ) * (1e-18 /1e-19) )= 0.856*10=8.56.

So ΔE ≈8.56 eV.

So, putting it back into the exponent.

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) ≈ 8.56 /8.617e-5 ≈ 99340 K.

So,

exponent = 99340 K * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 ≈4.50.

Because e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of LTE. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_2 - E_1 = \Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Without spots**: \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **With spots**: \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to a photon of wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference is related to the wavelength by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Temperature Factor
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 5500}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

Here, \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). Substituting \(\Delta E = 8.57 \, \text{eV}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99340 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, calculate the temperature difference term:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) = 99340 \cdot 0.00001515 \approx 1.506.
\]

Finally, compute the factor:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.
