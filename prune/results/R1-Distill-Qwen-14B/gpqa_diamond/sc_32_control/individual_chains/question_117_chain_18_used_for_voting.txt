Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, which means the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So this is a biphenyl structure with substituents. The substituents are nitro groups on the 6 positions and carboxylate groups on the 2 positions of each benzene ring. Each carboxylate is a methyl ester. Wait, so the central part is the biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The question is whether this structure has a chiral center or any stereogenic elements.

Wait, the structure is a biphenyl, which usually can have a plane of symmetry. But the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let's visualize: each benzene ring has two substituents at 2 and 6 positions. But wait, for biphenyls, if the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule might lack a plane of symmetry, leading to possible optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can have a certain configuration.

Wait, in biphenyls, the arrangement around the central bond can lead to cis or trans isomerism. But wait, is that a type of stereoisomerism? Yes, that's called geometric isomerism or cis-trans isomerism. But is that optical isomerism? No, because geometric isomerism relates to the arrangement around a double bond (like in alkenes) or in rings. Optical isomerism is about chirality, so a molecule having a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that the biphenyl itself creates a chiral center. Wait, no, the biphenyl is connected by a single bond, so the rotation around it would make the substituents on either side equivalent, unless there's some hindrance. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Let me think: the 2 and 6 are on the same benzene ring, so each has a nitro and a carboxylate group on each ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two rings are connected, and the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is mirrored, but if the arrangement is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because all substituents are symmetrical. Let me think: each benzene ring has two substituents, nitro and carboxylate, in the 2 and 6 positions. So each ring is symmetric because 2 and 6 are both substituents. Wait, the positions on a benzene ring are such that 2 and 6 are actually adjacent to each other. For each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across each other? No, wait, in a benzene ring, numbering starts and goes around. So position 1 is one carbon, position 2 is adjacent, position 3 is next, etc. So positions 2 and 6 are across from each other? Wait, no. Let me think: in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So position 2 is next to position 1 and 3. Position 6 is next to position 5 and 1. So 2 and 6 are not opposite each other but are adjacent and across from each other. Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are arranged in order. So positions 2 and 6 are actually adjacent to position 1. Wait, no. Let me number the benzene ring: 1, 2, 3 in order, so 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. 2 is next to 1 and 3. 3 is next to 2 and 4. 4 is next to 3 and 5. 5 is next to 4 and 6. 6 is next to 5 and 1. So positions 2 and 6 are opposite each other because starting from 1, if you go clockwise, 1,2,3,4,5,6. So positions 2 and 6 are across from each other.

Ah, so each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2, or vice versa? Wait, the name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So on each benzene ring, the substituents are nitro at position 6 and carboxylate at position 2.

So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across each other. So each ring is symmetric because having substituents at 2 and 6 would make the ring have a plane of symmetry through the central carbon (position 1). Wait, but position 1 is where the two benzene rings are connected.

So the biphenyl has two benzene rings connected at position 1 of each. Each benzene has substituents at 2 and 6 (which are across each other). So the substituents on each ring are nitro and carboxylate, across from each other. So each ring is symmetrical in that substitution. But looking at the entire molecule, could the arrangement around the central bond lead to possible stereoisomerism?

Wait, another possibility: since the substituents on each ring are in the same positions (2 and 6), but maybe the arrangement on each ring could be such that the molecule as a whole doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are such that the entire molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and the same substituents on each ring, then perhaps the whole molecule is symmetrical. But wait, the substituents on each ring are the same: each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the two rings are identical in substitution. If the two substituents are on each ring across from each other, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. So I'm starting to think that this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about whether the compound has enantiomers. So if the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have enantiomers. So option 1 is not an optical isomer.

Hmm, moving on to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The formula would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH(OH) ?

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Then the ester would be the methyl ester, so the acid part becomes COOCH3, so the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3?

Wait, no. Alternatively, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate as an ester is O

Wait, perhaps another approach: the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2COOH. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, right? So the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Looking at the molecule, the chiral centers would be any carbon attached to four different groups. Let's look at each carbon:

The central carbon (second carbon) is CH2, so it's CH2(OH) and CH2COOCH3. So each is connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, the structure is:

The molecule is: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the carbons are: 

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- Carbon 2: CH2 (connected to carbon 1 and 3)
- Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- Carbon 3: CH2COOCH3
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it:

The structure is: 

HOCH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups: one to the hydroxyl (HOCH2-) and one to the COOCH3 (CH2COOCH3).

Wait, but each of those CH2 groups is itself a CH2. So carbon 2 (the middle CH2) has two identical groups? Because it's connected to another CH2 on both sides. So for carbon 2: the substituents are two CH2 groups (each connected to different parts). Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon is CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups (each on either side), and two hydrogens. So that can't be a chiral center because it's not bonded to four different groups. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, then where are the chiral centers? The first carbon is CH2(OH) connected to a CH2 group (so the substituents are two CH2 groups and two hydrogens?), no. Wait, the first carbon is CH2(OH), so it's connected to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (the next carbon),
- and one hydrogen.

Wait, no, the first carbon is CH2(OH), so it's connected to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (the next carbon and perhaps another? No, wait, in this structure, it's a chain: HOCH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So the first carbon is CH2(OH), so connected to OH, two CH2 groups (the next carbon and one from the chain?), and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH) (so groups are OH, CH2 (carbon2), H, H?) No, wait, each CH2 has two Hs. So carbon 1 is CH2(OH), which is connected to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (carbon 2 and perhaps the other part? No, because it's a chain).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So looking for chiral centers, any carbon with four different groups.

Carbon 1: CH2(OH) attached to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (carbon 2 and from where else? Maybe the adjacent carbons. So it's connected to:

Carbon 1: attached to CH2(OH), which is connected to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (carbon 2 and another?), no.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each carbon:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH) → connected to OH, two CH2 groups (carbon 2 and the other, but perhaps not), and a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because all the CH2 groups are symmetric. So, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because sometimes esters can have chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's if the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the COOCH3. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So each carbon:

Carbon 1: HOCH2- → connected to OH, two CH2 groups (carbon 2 and another), and a hydrogen.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to two CH2 groups (carbon 1 and 3), and two hydrogens. So no chiral center here.

Carbon 3: CH2COOCH3. So connected to COOCH3, two CH2 groups (carbon 2 and where else?), and a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a carbon attached to four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbon attached to the hydroxyl is the same as the carbon attached to the ester group? No, because in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, and the ester is on the third.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH.

No, wait, that can't be right because the order is important. The correct structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH2) is between HOCH2 and CH2COOCH3. Both are CH2 groups attached to the middle carbon. So the middle carbon is CH2, so it's connected to two identical groups (two CH2 groups), making it not a chiral center.

So, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is CH with four different groups.

Wait, another approach: the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. The carbons are:

1: CH2OH,

2: CH2,

3: COOCH3.

Carbon 2 is CH2, connected to:

- CH2OH (carbon 1),
- CH2COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- two Hs.

So, it's connected to two CH2 groups and two Hs. So it's CH2, which means it's not a chiral center because it's not attached to four different groups.

So, no chiral centers here. So option 2 doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but that can't be right because I thought that option 2 is a possibility in the answers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Maybe the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3COOCH2CH2OH, which would be methyl glycolate. In that case, the structure is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, that's not right because the ester group comes from the acid. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, so the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So, back to the structure: looking for any chiral centers. The only possible candidate is carbon 2. But in this structure, it's connected to two CH2 groups (carbon 1 and 3), and two Hs. So no, not a chiral center.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm wrong and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up whether 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH3COOCH2CH2OH. Wait, no, that's ethylene glycol diacetate or something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, another approach: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that's not correct. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH3.

So the carbons are:

- Carbon 1: HOCH2-
- Carbon 2: CH2-
- Carbon 3: C(=O)OCH3.

So, the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (HOCH2-),
- Carbon 3 (C(=O)OCH3),
- and two Hs.

So, carbon 2 is CH2, which can't be a chiral center. So, no chiral centers in this molecule. So option 2 does not show optical isomerism. Hmm, but looking at the answer options, option 2 is included in option A and D.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is different. Another possibility is that the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would be methyl 3-hydroxypropanoate. But that's a different compound. So in that case, the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

In that case, the middle carbon (the one with OH) would be connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2? No, wait. Let me see: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH (from where?) No, wait, no, the middle carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- OH,
- and one more H that's attached to the same carbon.

Wait, no, in that structure, the middle carbon is CH(OH), which has:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different groups attached to that carbon: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's a chiral center. So if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the molecule would have a chiral center and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, the name given is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the correct structure should be:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's the same as before, which doesn't have a chiral center. So I'm getting confused here. Another thought: perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain, making the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group, then it would have a chiral center.

Wait, maybe the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. But then the acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. In that case, the middle carbon (the CH(OH)) would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the correct structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate being CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. In that case, the middle carbon is a chiral center, so the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 is correct.

Wait, but how does the numbering work? Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain, making it CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing propanoate and another structure. I'm getting stuck here. Let me move on and come back.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings connected to a ketone group (C=O). The structure is:

Ar-C(=O)-Ar.

Where Ar is a benzene ring. Now, does benzophenone have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen. So the groups attached are two benzene rings, one oxygen (as part of the ketone), and a hydrogen. Wait, no, in benzophenone, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings, one O (as in C=O), and another group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph, so the central carbon has two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and another phenyl? No, wait, benzophenone has the structure where the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a ketone oxygen. Wait, no, the structure is Ph–CO–Ph.

So, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (C=O), and another phenyl group? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is part of the carbonyl group (C=O), and is connected to two phenyl groups. So, the central carbon in the carbonyl is double-bonded to O, so it can't have four single bonds. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

In that case, the central carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and a double bond to O. So it can't have a chiral center because it's only bonded to three groups, not four. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester form. The structure of fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the dimethyl ester would be (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester, which is (E)-CH2CH2(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene something. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, more accurately, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. The ester would be where the -OH groups are replaced by OMe groups. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, wait, no, but fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-C=CH2
    |
O-C-OCH3
    |
O

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that the structure is:

Each of the two carboxylate groups (COOCH3) is attached to the same carbon in a trans configuration across the double bond.

So the molecule is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, actually, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, which is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH in the trans configuration. The ester would be OMe groups instead of OH. So the structure is OMeOOC-CH=CH-COO-OMe. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
    |        |
    O-C-OCH3  O

Wait, no, perhaps I should look it up mentally. Fumarate is the trans ester of maleic acid. So the structure is:

COOCH3
     |
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

But that's not right. Alternatively, in fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But wait, that would make it the trans configuration.

Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each COOCH3 is on a different carbon of the double bond. So the two COOCH3 groups are on adjacent carbons, but across the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So the structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe? No, wait, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe? No, because that would be a single bond, not a double bond. So it's MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe is succinic acid dimethyl ester. No, fumarate has a double bond.

So correct structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

So the molecule has a double bond with the two ester groups on opposite sides, making it the trans isomer.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? No, because each carbon on the double bond is bonded to two identical groups. Each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, but actually, in this case, each carbon of the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, the structure is:

The double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So each of these carbons is attached to two different groups: COOCH3 and CH2.

Wait, for each of these carbons (the ones in the double bond), they're each connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2 (which is connected to another COOCH3? No, wait. Let me think again. The structure is:

COOCH3
     |
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, no, the structure is COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 is succinate. Fumarate has a double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
     |
CH2-C=CH2
     |
COOCH3

No, that's not correct because the double bond would be between the two CH2 groups. Oh, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans ester of maleic acid, which has the structure:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

So each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and another COOCH3 group. No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps each carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternative approach: does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. Wait, in the trans configuration, the two groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. So there's a plane of symmetry in the molecule, meaning it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that would imply that the molecule isn't chiral. But wait, let me think again. The molecule has a double bond with substituents on both sides. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Oh wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, which is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, actually, no. The correct structure is:

Each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two central carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. No, I'm not getting this right. Let me think of fumarate as the trans ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is cis, and fumarate is trans.

But regardless, in this case, each of the two carbons in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group (from the adjacent methyl ester). Wait, perhaps each is bonded to two COOCH3 groups. No, that can't be, since each ester is on a different carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the second carbon (CH) has two COOCH3 groups attached.

Wait, no, that can't be because each ester group is on a separate carbon. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
     |
CH2-C=CH2
     |
COOCH3

Wait, that can't be correct because that would imply the double bond is between the two CH2 groups, which isn't possible. Alternatively, the structure is:

COOCH3
     |
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

But that's a single bond, not a double bond.

I'm getting stuck, but let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. No, because the molecule is symmetrical. For example, in the trans configuration, the groups are mirrored across the double bond, so the molecule is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility: maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, which would prevent chirality. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but this contradicts what I thought earlier. I think I need to revisit each option.

So, to recap:

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not sure about this. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the structure has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. But earlier confusion made me think it might, depending on the structure.

Option 3: benzophenone. No chiral centers.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule is symmetrical, no chiral centers.

Wait, another approach: let's look for any other possibilities.

If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So for each option, does the molecule have such a plane?

Option 1: The biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So no optical isomerism.

Option 2: If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the middle carbon is a chiral center (attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H), so this would have optical isomerism.

Option 4: If the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is (E), which is trans. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. So no chirality.

So, among the options, which ones exhibit optical isomerism?

Option 2 (if it has a chiral center) and option 4 (no).

Wait, for option 4, since it's a trans double bond, does the molecule have any stereogenic elements? No, because if it's a trans configuration, it doesn't create a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

So, looking again, which options have molecules that can exhibit optical isomerism?

Looking at the options:

1. No,

2. Yes,

3. No,

4. No.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 might have a chiral center, but I'm now convinced it doesn't.

So, the only option that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

But according to my current analysis, only option 2 has optical isomerism. So the correct answer would be option 2.

Wait, but I'm not seeing any other options. Let me check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier with option 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Its structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but wait, that's not correct. The correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that's not right. Let me clarify.

Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. The structure of maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, each COOCH3 is on a separate carbon. So the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But in this case, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3), so no, they can't be chiral centers. Because each would have two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and another group. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group,

- One CH2 group,

- And a double bond to the other carbon.

Wait, no. Let me better visualize this. The structure is:

CH2-COOCH3

     \
      \
       C=C

     /
      /
CH2-COOCH3

No, that can't be correct. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

So each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group on one side and another group on the other. Wait, but in this case, each carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, because each carbon is part of a double bond, so each is connected to one COOCH3 and the other carbon in the double bond, which is also connected to another COOCH3. So each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups? No, wait, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group on one side and another group on the other. But if it's (E), then the substituents are opposite.

Wait, perhaps in the dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each is CH2-COOCH3 on either end.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, going back, the only option that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option A says 1, 2, and 4 show optical isomerism, which would imply that option 2 and option 4 do. But I'm now convinced that option 4 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Let me think: if the structure were different, would it have a chiral center?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate's structure is such that the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons, but in a way that each carbon has three different groups. No, wait, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, so each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. So each is CH2-C(OOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 and one CH2 group, but that's not possible because each carbon in a double bond is bonded to two groups in the double bond.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond has a CH2 group and a COOCH3 group. So, for each carbon in the double bond:

- One CH2 group,

- One COOCH3 group,

- And the double bond.

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is bonded to three groups: one CH2 and one COOCH3, and the double bond. No, that can't be, because each carbon in a double bond is bonded to two groups in the double bond. So perhaps each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a CH2 group and a COOCH3 group. So each has:

- CH2,

- COOCH3,

- And the double bond (which connects to the other carbon).

Wait, but that would leave two bonds unaccounted for. Hmm, perhaps I should give up on this and proceed.

So, to sum up, the only option that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2 and perhaps option 1, if it has a chiral center.

Wait, let's reevaluate option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

This biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The question is whether the molecule is chiral.

The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Wait, considering the biphenyl structure, if the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para positions relative to each other, then each ring is symmetric. But the arrangement between the two rings could affect the molecule's symmetry.

If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the two rings mirror each other, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2, and the substituents are arranged so that the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond, then it's not chiral.

But I'm not certain. Another approach is to think about whether the molecule has any centers of asymmetry or if it's superimposable on its mirror image.

If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomerism. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the central bond, then the molecule is not chiral.

But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has substituents para to each other. So, if you look at the two benzene rings connected by a single bond, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that could create a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the central bond. So the substituents on each ring are mirror images across that plane, making the molecule achiral.

So option 1 would not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only option that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

But looking back at the answer options, the only option that includes option 2 is option A (which includes 1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2).

Wait, but according to my analysis, only option 2 has optical isomerism. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 4 actually has a chiral center.

Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is actually a meso compound, which is achiral despite having stereogenic centers, due to an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, the molecule would have two stereogenic centers if each carbon in the double bond is a stereogenic center. But in fumarate, if each carbon in the double bond is a stereogenic center, but the molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral despite having stereogenic centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, among the options, only option 2 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking back at the options, none of the answer options list only option 2. Looking at the available options:

A) 1,2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, according to my analysis, only option 2 has optical isomerism, but the answer options don't have an option with just 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I was wrong about option 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because it's a trans di-substituted alkene, which is not itself a chiral center.

Wait, but let me think about another scenario. Suppose the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, not in the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, reviewing all, the only option that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2. But the answer options don't have an option with just 2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 2.

Going back to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the middle carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule would have optical isomerism. So option 2 does.

Now, looking at the options, option A includes 2 and 4, but I thought 4 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate.

So, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Each of the carbons in the double bond has substituents:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (on both sides)

So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So each has two different substituents. So each of these carbons is attached to two different groups in addition to the double bond.

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- A CH2 group,

- A COOCH3 group,

- And the double bond to the other carbon.

So, each carbon has three substituents: two substituents (CH2 and COOCH3) and the double bond. Wait, but a double bond is a single substituent, not two.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to two substituents: one CH2 and one COOCH3, and the other two bonds are part of the double bond.

So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two different groups (CH2 and COOCH3), but the double bond doesn't contribute to a chiral center because it's part of the double bond.

Thus, each carbon in the double bond is not a chiral center because it's part of a double bond and can't have four substituents.

So, option 4 doesn't have any chiral centers.

Thus, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options have only option 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option 1.

Let me think again about option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on each benzene ring are symmetrical, then the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral.

But wait, each benzene ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring is symmetric with respect to a vertical plane through the central bond.

So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only option left is option 2. But the answer options don't have an option that only includes 2.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, none of the options say only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps option 4 actually does have a chiral center.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

In this structure, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon is CH(COOCH3)2. But in reality, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each has two identical substituents (COOCH3 and COOCH3), and the double bond. So no chiral centers.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, the only one that has optical isomerism is option 2. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 2. Let me think again about its structure.

The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which has a chiral center in the middle carbon. So option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Now, looking at the options, option A includes 2, and option D includes 2 as well.

But according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct, but none of the options have just 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1 and option 4.

Another possibility: perhaps option 1 has a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each benzene ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The two benzene rings are connected at position 1.

If the two substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks such a plane, then it's chiral.

Wait, for each benzene ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring is symmetric across the central bond. But the two rings are connected, and the substituents on each are in the same positions. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Thus, option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Another approach: perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the two rings are non-superimposable mirror images.

But if the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

So, option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only option is option 2, but none of the options include only 2. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me think about each option's possibility.

Option 1: No.

Option 2: Yes.

Option 3: No.

Option 4: No.

So the correct answer is option 2, but the options don't have that. Thus, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of option 4.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Wait, no, because it's the trans isomer and has a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, which would relate to cis-trans isomerism, not optical isomerism.

Thus, the only option with optical isomerism is option 2.

But looking at the answer options, none have only option 2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but according to my analysis, option 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake and option 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a CH2 group and a COOCH3 group. So each has:

- CH2,

- COOCH3,

- And the double bond.

So, each of these carbons is connected to two different groups: CH2 and COOCH3.

But each carbon in the double bond is connected to three groups: two substituents and the double bond. Wait, no, each carbon is bonded to two substituents (CH2 and COOCH3) and the other carbon via a double bond, making it a trigonal planar geometry. So, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents and the double bond. Thus, they don't have four substituents, so they can't be chiral centers.

Thus, option 4 doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, the only option is option 2. But none of the answer options have only 2. Therefore, I must conclude that I made a mistake in analyzing option 2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Let me think again.

The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The middle carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and H.

Wait, that's four different groups. So it's a chiral center. Therefore, option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer must include option 2. Looking at the options, option A includes 2 and 4, option D includes 2 and 1.

But according to my analysis, option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only if option 4 has optical isomerism, which I don't think it does.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or other features that allow for enantiomers.

---

### **Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. The molecule is symmetric due to the identical substitution pattern on both rings, and there is a plane of symmetry bisecting the central bond. As a result, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is **CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3**. The middle carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (**CH3**), a carboxylate group (**COOCH3**), a hydrogen (**H**), and the hydroxyl group (**OH**). This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism (enantiomers).

---

### **Option 3: Benzophenone**
Benzophenone has the structure **Ph-C(=O)-Ph**, where **Ph** represents a benzene ring. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical benzene rings. Since it is not bonded to four different groups, it lacks a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**
Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-isomer of butenedioate, with the structure **CH2=C(COOCH3)2**. The two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to a methyl ester group (**COOCH3**) and a hydrogen. Due to the trans configuration, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Option 1**: No optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).  
- **Option 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center present).  
- **Option 3**: No optical isomerism (no chiral center).  
- **Option 4**: No optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).  

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **Option 2**. However, none of the provided answer choices include only Option 2. Based on the analysis, the closest answer is **Option A**, which includes Option 2, even though Options 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Answer: A**
