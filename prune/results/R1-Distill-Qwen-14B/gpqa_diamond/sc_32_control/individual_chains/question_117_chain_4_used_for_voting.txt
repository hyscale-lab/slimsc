Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me. It's about optical isomerism, which I remember has to do with molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 6' with nitro groups and at positions 2 and 2' with carboxylate groups. Since it's dimethyl, the carboxylate groups are esterified with methyl. Now, biphenyls can have different conformations—like the two benzene rings can rotate relative to each other. But can this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Wait, nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing and might affect symmetry. But I'm more concerned about chiral centers. Are any of the carbons attached to four different groups?

Looking at the structure, the central carbon where the two phenyl rings are connected is probably the one in question. Wait, actually, in biphenyl, the connecting carbon (the one in the middle) is connected to two phenyl groups, a methyl ester group (from the carboxylate), and a nitro group? No, wait, the substituents are at 6 and 2 positions on each ring. Let me think again. Maybe the structure has a central carbon that's attached to four different groups? Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the substituents are symmetrical on both rings, like the nitro and carboxylate groups are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, the positions are 6,6' and 2,2'. If the biphenyl has the substituents mirrored on each ring, maybe it's not chiral. So, perhaps there's no chiral center here, and thus no optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, sometimes in biphenyls, the arrangement can lead to axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism not based on tetrahedral chiral centers. Axial chirality is when the two substituents on each phenyl ring are on opposite sides, leading to different configurations. So if the molecule has such a structure, it can have enantiomers. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe this compound can't have axial chirality because of the symmetry. Let me think. If both substituents on each ring are in the same positions (like 6 and 6', 2 and 2'), perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical activity. Maybe not. So I'm not sure about this one yet. I'll have to come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw this. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH3 ester. Wait no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO- methyl ester. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no, wait. The carboxylic acid is on the first carbon. So the ester is O=C-O-Me, attached to the first carbon. The second carbon has a hydroxyl group and two CH2 groups. Wait, I think it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is connected to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate is three carbons. So the first carbon is the COOCH3, the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(H)(OH)-COOCH3. So the molecule is:

CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's three carbons: the first is CH2, the second is CH(OH), and third is COOCH3. No, wait: wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester is O=C-OCH3 attached to the first carbon. Then the second carbon has a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

COOCH3 is on the first carbon. The second carbon is CH2 connected to a hydroxyl group, and the third is a methyl group (maybe). So the molecule is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's three carbons in the chain. The central carbon (CH2) would have two CH2 groups attached. Wait, no. Alternative approach: the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3.

Wait, that's a possibility. So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to what? Let's see: the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to COOCH3 on one side, and two CH3 groups? No, wait, the structure would be:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? I think it's the latter. So the structure is:

COOCH3 is attached to the second carbon. Let me think. No, wait, propanoate is three carbons. So, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So the structure is CH(CH3)(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has hydroxyl, two CH2 groups, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no. Let me think again. For propanoate, the formula is CH2CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the compound is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's look for a chiral center. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) would be connected to:

- COOCH3 group
- two CH2 groups (if it's CH2-OH-CH2-COOCH3, that's not correct because the chain is three carbons). Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3: so the second carbon is CH2. Oh, wait, no, that would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, but the second carbon is CH2, meaning it's attached to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3. Wait, that can't be because a CH2 group can't have four different substituents. So maybe the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH3
- two hydrogens (if structure is CH(CH3)(OH)COOCH3?), but that would mean the carbon has only three substituents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would have the hydroxyl on a CH2, which can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (two CH2's). So no, that can't be. Wait, maybe the hydroxyl is on the central carbon, which is attached to four different groups.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3 (methyl)
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- two hydrogens. No, wait, then it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. But that would have the central carbon with CH3, two CH (from COOCH3?), and OH. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: in any case, is there a chiral center here? If the compound is 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester, then the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is a CH2 group. That can't be a chiral center because CH2 groups have two identical H's. So no chiral centers here. Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial thought. I thought it might have a chiral center, but maybe not. So perhaps this compound doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (methyl)
- COOCH3 (ester)
- OH
- and another CH3? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups. Let me check another approach. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy means OH on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2-OH. But that's a CH2 group, which can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical H's. So no chiral center in this molecule. Hence, no optical isomerism. So compound 2 doesn't show optical isomerism. But wait, wait! Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. What if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? That would have the OH on the second carbon, which is a CH group, not CH2. So in that case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (from CH3)
- COOCH3 (ester)
- OH
- and another CH3 (so no, it's not four different groups). Wait, no. Wait, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH (up)
- and another H (down). Wait, no, that central carbon would have a methyl group, an ester group, a hydroxyl, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. Oh! So that's a chiral center. So then, this molecule would have a chiral center and show optical isomerism. So, compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So which one is correct? Let me think: the IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be:

Carboxylic ester group on the first carbon, then the second carbon is CH2OH, and the third is CH3. No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

The molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But that makes the second carbon a CH2OH group, which can't be a chiral center. So perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct structure is such that the second carbon is a CH(OH) group, making it a chiral center. Hmm. Let me think again: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the formula is CH2-CH2-COOCH3. But with a hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH2 group (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (ester)
- OH group
- and a H.

Wait, but that's four different groups: CH2 (from left), COOCH3 (right), OH (top), and H (bottom). So that's a chiral center. So the molecule would have optical isomers. So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait! Another way: the propanoate is CH2-CH2-COOCH3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2-OH, which can't be a chiral center because CH2 groups have two Hs. So no. So perhaps I'm confused about the structure.

Wait, maybe I should think of the formula. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Its methyl ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the same but with an OH on the second carbon. So structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The middle carbon is CH2-OH. So, no chiral center. So then, no optical isomerism for compound 2.

Wait, but this is conflicting. Which is correct? Let me think again. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the middle carbon is CH2-OH. That can't be a chiral center. So compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm. Maybe I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3, which would have a chiral center. So which is correct?

Wait, the IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; so the 2-hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2. No, so no chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 does not show optical isomerism. But wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps I have to conclude that compound 2 does have a chiral center. Maybe I should proceed and think about the other compounds.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. A ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl. The carbonyl is a planar group, so the molecule is symmetrical. Are there any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. So no chiral centers. And since the molecule is symmetrical, it can't have enantiomers. So no optical isomerism here.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. Wait, no, fumarate is actually the trans isomer. Wait, let me think. Maleic acid has the cis diastereomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. But in any case, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Structure-wise, it's (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is CH2CH2 (but in trans configuration) as the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, no: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of a double bond, with the substituents on opposite sides. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, wait, perhaps it's better to imagine it as CH2=CH with each CH2 connected to an OCO2Me group. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3   O
        ||
        C
       / \
      CH2 CH2-O-CO-OCH3?

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be. Alternatively, it's (E)-1,2-dimethylfumarate, which would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. But regardless, the critical point is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomers. But dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, but does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. If it's E (trans), then the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule would not be symmetrical, as each substituent is on opposite sides. So, in such a case, is the molecule chiral?

Wait, but wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. For example, a meso compound. So, in dimethyl fumarate, if the structure is symmetrical, perhaps it's a meso compound. Let me imagine the structure: the central double bond is CH2-CH2, each connected to OCO2Me groups. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides (E configuration), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the molecule would have a center of symmetry. If I draw it, the left side would mirror the right, making it symmetrical. So if the molecule is symmetrical, it's not chiral. But wait, another possibility: in the E configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, so the molecule is not symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps it's symmetrical. For instance, if the two ester groups are mirror images across the double bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester. The structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's not correct. No, the correct structure is:

Each of the two carbonyl groups is connected to a methyl ester and a CH2 group. So the structure is trans on the double bond, such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the two substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically.

Wait, considering that both ester groups are the same (methyl), and the arrangement is such that each ester is on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule would be symmetrical. If so, then it's a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry and thus is achiral. So there would be no optical isomerism. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, another approach: in dimethyl maleate (cis), the two ester groups are on the same side, so the molecule is chiral (enantiomers possible). In dimethyl fumarate (trans), the two ester groups are on opposite sides. But if the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound, making it achiral. Let me think: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, like a mirror plane through the center of the double bond, then it's symmetrical. For example:

O
||
O-C-OCH3    O
            ||
            C
           / \
          CH2 CH2-O-CO-OCH3

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2=C(OCO2Me)2

But in the trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule would have no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But wait, no: because each ester group is the same, perhaps the molecule still has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: imagine the double bond is in the middle, and each substituent (OCO2Me) is on the opposite side. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, making it achiral. So, in that case, the molecule is not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again: if the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, but in trans configuration, then the molecule is symmetrical along the plane that cuts through the double bond. So it's a meso compound, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. If the structure is such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides, then perhaps it's not a meso compound. Because each group is the same, but on opposite sides. Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, another example: tartaric acid has two stereocenters. The meso form has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Similarly, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, hence no optical isomerism. So, moving on.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about another approach. Optical isomerism requires either a chiral center or a different type of stereoisomerism, such as axial chirality. But in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps there's no chiral center, but the molecule has a double bond with substituents arranged in a way that allows for stereoisomerism. Wait, but if it's a trans configuration, maybe it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, perhaps compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me try to find another approach. Let me think about each compound again.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, a biphenyl with substituents at 6 and 6' (nitro groups) and at 2 and 2' (carboxylate groups). The question is whether this molecule has axial chirality. Because in biphenyls, the arrangement around the single bond can lead to different configurations. But if the substituents are symmetrical, the molecule may not be chiral.

Wait, in 1,1'-biphenyl, the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring (carboxylate groups), and at 6 and 6' (nitro groups). So each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate group in the para positions. So the arrangement is symmetrical, making the molecule achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it might be chiral. For example, if one ring has a nitro group on one side and a carboxylate on the other, and the other ring has the same arrangement but mirrored, then the molecule would be symmetrical. So, perhaps it's a meso compound, making it achiral. So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this. Another possibility is that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But given the substituents, I think it's symmetrical, so no.

So, summing up:

1. No optical isomerism.
2. Earlier I was confused, but perhaps this one has a chiral center, so yes.
3. Benzophenone: no.
4. Dimethyl fumarate: maybe no, due to being a meso compound.

Wait, but earlier I thought about compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, as possibly being a meso compound, thus no optical isomerism. But I might be wrong. Let me think again. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, which show optical isomerism?

Only compound 2, perhaps. But wait, let me check compound 4 again. If dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound, then it would have optical isomerism.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. Let me compare it to dimethyl maleate, which is the cis isomer. Dimethyl maleate has two ester groups on the same side, leading to a chiral center (or maybe two). So, dimethyl maleate would have optical isomerism. But dimethyl fumarate (the trans isomer) would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate and isn't a meso compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical activity.

So, back to the four compounds:

1. No.

2. Let's reevaluate. The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the hydroxyl is on a chiral center, then yes. So, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is a chiral center, so it would have optical isomers.

Wait, let me think of the structure correctly. The correct IUPAC name would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is propanoic acid with a hydroxyl on carbon 2, esterified with methyl.

So, structure: Carbon 1 is COOCH3, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), Carbon 3 is CH3. So:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

Thus, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (ester)
- CH3 (methyl)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- and another H.

Wait, so yes, four different groups. So that's a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 has optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are:

- 2

- 4? No. Because I thought 4 doesn't.

Wait, 4 is dimethyl fumarate. I'm not entirely confident, but I think 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the options are:

1. No

2. Yes

3. No

4. No

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → So 2 is correct, but 4?

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No, because 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → No, since 1 doesn't.

Wait, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 2 is correct, others may vary.

B) 3 and 4 → 3 is no, 4 may be no.

C) 2 and 3 → No.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no.

Wait, none of the options have only 2 as correct. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, perhaps compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, is a meso compound, so no optical isomerism. So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, which option includes only 2? Let's see the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → includes 2.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No.

D) 1 and 2 → No.

So, if the correct answer is only 2, then the correct option would be A (if 4 is included) or none. But perhaps I'm wrong about 4.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,2-dimethylfumarate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3   O
            ||
            C
           / \
          CH2 CH2-O-CO-OCH3

No, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2=CH with each CH2 connected to an OCO2Me group. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Each C has an OCO2Me group attached.

In the case of fumarate (trans), the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But wait, that's not correct. Another approach: the structure is (E)- butenedioate. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, if the substituents are identical on both ends (both are OCO2Me), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So, it would be a meso compound, making it achiral.

Thus, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, option A is 1, 2, and 4. Since 1 and 4 are no, and 2 is yes, then option A is incorrect.

But wait, the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let's think again: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. If the substituents on each end are the same (OCO2Me), and arranged trans, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Yes, through the center of the double bond, making it symmetrical. So, it's a meso compound, hence no optical isomerism.

So, if only compound 2 has optical isomerism, which option includes only 2? Looking at the options:

The options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4 → includes 2 but also 1 and 4, which we think are no.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → no.

Wait, none of the options have only 2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's reevaluate the compounds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl structure: each phenyl ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Each has a nitro group (6) and a carboxylate group (2). So, the arrangement is such that each ring has nitro and carboxylate groups in para positions.

But does this create a chiral center? Alternatively, does the molecule have axial chirality? Axial chirality refers to chirality arising from the arrangement of substituents around a single bond, such as in biphenyls.

In biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are arranged non-symmetrically, the molecule can be chiral. For example, if the groups on each ring are on opposite sides, the molecule can lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So, in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. The question is whether their arrangement leads to axial chirality.

If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the groups are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on both rings, which are para to each other. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group in para positions. If both rings are identical in substituents, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but perhaps the arrangement around the single bond leads to different configurations. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans), leading to different stereoisomers.

In such cases, the molecule can have axial chirality, leading to enantiomers.

So, the question is: does this compound have axial chirality?

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that they are not symmetrical, then the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, the molecule might be symmetrical, making it achiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group para to each other. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1' positions. So, the entire molecule is symmetrical along the axis connecting the two rings. So, the substituents are mirrored on each ring, leading to a plane of symmetry. Thus, no axial chirality, so no optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not a meso compound. Wait, no. Let me think in terms of actual structures.

Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. The dimethyl esters would have the same properties. So, dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester.

Wait, but in the trans (E) configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, if the substituents are the same (both OCO2Me), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, hence achiral.

So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

But looking again at the options, none of the options include only 2. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in determining whether compound 4 has optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 2.

Wait, another approach: maybe compound 4 does have optical isomerism because it doesn't have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, but arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

But if the substituents are the same and arranged trans, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is asymmetrical because of the way the substituents are arranged around the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think of tartaric acid as a comparison. In the meso form, it's achiral; in the other forms, it's chiral. So, if dimethyl fumarate is analogous to the meso form, it's achiral.

So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options again, none of them include only 2. Hmm. Let me recheck the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4 → all three have optical isomerism.

B) 3 and 4 → 3 is no, 4 may be no.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 is no.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no.

So, if only 2 is correct, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 2. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: methyl, ester, hydroxyl, and hydrogen. So, that's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So, yes, compound 2 has optical isomerism.

Now, looking at the options, the only one that includes 2 is option A and option D.

Option A includes 1, 2, and 4. If 4 has optical isomerism, then option A is correct.

But earlier I thought 4 doesn't have it. So, perhaps I was wrong about 4.

Let me think again about compound 4.

Dimethyl fumarate: the structure is O-CO-OCH3 on each end of a trans double bond.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, it's CH2=C with each CH2 connected to OCO2Me.

So, structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3   O
            ||
            C
           / \
          CH2 CH2-O-CO-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2=C(OCO2Me)2 (but in trans configuration).

In this case, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

If the substituents are identical and on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

So, compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option with only 2. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Another way to think about it: dimethyl fumarate is the diethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a trans-diacid, and its dimethyl ester would retain the trans configuration.

But regardless of the configuration (cis or trans), if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate (trans), the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it a meso compound, thus achiral.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4. Let me think: if the two substituents on each end are the same, and the molecule is trans, then it's symmetrical, hence no optical isomerism. So, compound 4 doesn't have it.

Thus, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group in the para positions.

Now, in biphenyls, the single bond allows for rotation, but sometimes the substituents can create axial chirality.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they are not symmetrical, the molecule can be chiral.

In this case, if the nitro group on one ring is on the same face as the carboxylate on the other ring, and vice versa, the molecule can lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

But since the substituents are in para positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, because the substituents are in 2 and 6 positions, which are para, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, I think compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, conclusion: only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But in the options, there's no option that includes only 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,2-dimethylfumarate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that structure doesn't look right. The correct structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the molecule is not symmetrical because the two ester groups are on opposite sides, but the molecule as a whole isn't symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, let me consider the structure again. If I imagine the molecule, the two ester groups are attached to each end of a double bond. In the trans configuration, they are on opposite sides. So, the molecule would look like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C==C
    /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would not be symmetrical because the substituents on each end are the same but arranged in a way that there's no mirror plane. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, no, because each ester group is identical, and the arrangement is symmetrical across the double bond, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, then a plane cutting through the middle of the double bond would make both halves mirror images. So, yes, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus achiral.

So, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include an option with only 2, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think: if the substituents are on opposite sides, but the molecule isn't symmetrical, perhaps because the substituents are not identical. Oh wait, in this case, the substituents are identical (both OCO2Me), so the molecule would be symmetrical.

So, I'm confident that compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't include an option with only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 3. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 3: benzophenone. Structure: (Ph)2CO. The carbonyl group is in the center, with two phenyl groups. The molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. So, perhaps there's an error in the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a non-symmetrical molecule, hence chiral. Let me think: if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same but arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, but the molecule looks the same after reflection, then it's symmetrical.

But in this case, each ester group is on opposite sides, but the molecule is symmetrical across the plane bisecting the double bond. So, it's a meso compound. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm now confused. Let me think about real examples. Dimethyl maleate is the cis isomer and is chiral, showing optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer and is a meso compound, hence not chiral.

So, in our question, compound 4 is dimethyl fumarate, which is a meso compound, thus no optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't include a choice with only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is A, which includes 1, 2, and 4, but I don't see why 1 would have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group in the para positions.

Now, in biphenyls, the substituents can create axial chirality. If the substituents on each ring are on opposite faces, the molecule is chiral.

But in this case, the substituents are in the same position (6 and 2) on each ring, which are para. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement around the central bond leads to the substituents being on opposite sides, creating a chiral axis.

In such a case, the molecule would be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

So, perhaps compound 1 does show optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism, and perhaps 4 doesn't.

But earlier I thought 1 didn't. So, perhaps I was wrong.

In that case, option D would include 1 and 2, which would be correct if both have optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4.

But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I should make a decision based on my analysis, even if it doesn't match the options.

Based on my analysis:

- Compound 2: yes, optical isomerism.

- All others: no.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound and does show optical isomerism.

In that case, compounds 2 and 4 would show optical isomerism, making option A (if 1 is included) or option A or another.

Wait, but according to the options, option A includes 1, 2, and 4.

So, if 2 and 4 are correct, and 1 is also correct, then option A is correct.

But I'm not confident about 1 and 4.

Hmm.

In conclusion, based on my analysis, the correct compounds that show optical isomerism are 2 and 4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps only 2 is correct.

But given the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and option D.

But if 4 is incorrect, the only option with 2 is option A (if 4 is incorrect), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should select option A, which includes 2 and 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the initial analysis, perhaps only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound and is chiral.

In that case, compounds 2 and 4 would show optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct option would be A (1,2,4), but I don't think 1 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires either a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on both rings, which creates a plane of symmetry. As a result, it is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetrical, and there are no chiral centers. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2=C(OCOCH3)2. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Due to the identical substituents on both ends of the double bond and the presence of a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, the molecule is a meso compound and not chiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Among the four compounds, only **Compound 2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only Compound 2. Based on the analysis, the closest option that includes Compound 2 is **Option A (1, 2, and 4)**, even though Compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.

Answer: A
