Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with some numbers in meters. Hmm.

I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on their lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is the product of the particle's lifetime and its speed. So I think the formula is something like L = c * τ * v, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, and v is the velocity.

Wait, but how do I find τ? Oh, from the uncertainty principle, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. If I recall correctly, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the width (which is the uncertainty in energy) to the lifetime (uncertainty in time). So Γ is approximately equal to ħ/τ. Or wait, maybe Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the units here might be a bit tricky. So Γ is given in MeV, and I need to convert everything into compatible units. Let's jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Compute the mean decay distance L = c * τ * v.

Starting with step 1: τ = ħ / Γ

But what's Γ in compatible units? Let me think about units. ħ is in units of GeV·s, right? So Γ needs to be in GeV as well. Oh wait, the given Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But what's the value of ħ in GeV·s? I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So plugging in, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Calculating 6.582 / 0.32: let me do that. 0.32 × 20 is 6.4, so 20.5625 × 0.32 is approximately 6.58, so 20.5625? Let me calculate 6.582 / 0.32. 32 × 20 is 640, 640 is 6.4 in terms of 0.32. 6.582-6.4 is 0.182. 0.182 / 0.32 is approximately 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So yes, around 20.56 * 1e-25 s. So τ ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 × 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is 0.182 more than 6.4. 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875. So 20 + 0.56875 = 20.56875. So τ = 20.56875 × 1e-25 s. So 2.056875 × 1e-24 s? No, wait, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Right.

Now step 2: find the velocity v of X. Since X is a meson, perhaps we can find its velocity from its energy and mass. The production energy is 8 GeV, but wait, the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV? Or wait, perhaps I should consider the total energy. Hmm, because the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but in particle physics, the energy given for a produced particle is often its total energy, not just kinetic. So I think E_X is the total energy.

So E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². So the energy is related to the rest mass and the kinetic energy. The total energy is gamma * m c². So the gamma factor is E / (m c²). So gamma = E_X / (m_X c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found using gamma. Remember that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So let's compute beta, which is v/c. Let me denote beta as v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, wait, let me think. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So 1/gamma² = 1 - beta². So beta² = 1 - 1/gamma². So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

Gamma is 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667, so gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 = 44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

But wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute 1/gamma^2.

gamma = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈ 6.666666667.

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.44444444.

1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute. Since 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775?

Let me compute 0.9887^2: 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604. 0.0087^2 is about 0.00007569. But wait, perhaps better to compute 98.87^2 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087².

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087 = 0.017292.

0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.

Sum: 0.9604 + 0.017292 = 0.977692, plus 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97776769. Hmm, but the target is 0.9775. So perhaps beta is a bit less than 0.9887. Let me find the exact sqrt(0.9775).

Wait, 0.9887^2 is about 0.9777, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So maybe sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9885 or so. Let me compute (0.9885)^2.

0.9885 * 0.9885:

Compute as (0.98 + 0.0085)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.0085 = 0.01718.

0.0085^2 = 0.00007225.

Sum: 0.9604 + 0.01718 = 0.97758 + 0.00007225 = 0.97765225.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps beta is 0.9885 minus a little. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate beta as approximately 0.9885.

So beta ≈ 0.9885, so v ≈ 0.9885 c.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would give a more precise value, but maybe I don't need that level of precision for this problem. Let me proceed with beta ≈ 0.9885.

Now, step 3: compute L = c * τ * v.

But wait, let me think about units. Let's make sure that units are handled correctly.

c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

τ is in seconds, v is in terms of c (so unitless). So L = c * τ * v.

So L = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) * 0.9885.

Let me compute this.

First, compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

3e8 is 3 * 1e8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiply them: 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625. Exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by v (0.9885): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9885 ≈ ?

So 6.170625 * 0.9885 ≈ let's compute.

6.170625 * 0.9885 = approximately 6.17 * 0.9885.

Let me compute 6 * 0.9885 = 5.931, 0.17 * 0.9885 ≈ 0.168. So total ≈ 5.931 + 0.168 = 6.099.

Wait, but wait, that's an approximation. Let me compute 6.170625 × 0.9885 more accurately.

Compute 6.170625 × 0.9885.

Let me compute:

6.170625 * 0.9885 = ?

Breakdown:

6.170625 * (1 - 0.0115) = 6.170625 - (6.170625 * 0.0115)

Compute 6.170625 * 0.0115: 0.0115 is 1.15e-2.

6.170625 * 0.01 = 0.06170625.

6.170625 * 0.0015 = 0.0092559375.

So 0.06170625 + 0.0092559375 = 0.0709621875.

So 6.170625 - 0.0709621875 = 6.0996628125.

So approximately 6.09966e-16 meters.

Wait, but that's the product of 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 * 0.9885, which is 6.09966e-16 m.

Looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range.

Looking back at the options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Wait, but my calculation gave around 6.1e-16 m, which isn't matching any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me re-examine my steps. Maybe I messed up the calculation of the lifetime or the velocity.

Let me check the calculation of tau again.

Tau is ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 = ?

0.32 × 20 = 6.4.

6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182.

0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.

So 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 20e-25 is 2e-24, plus 0.56875e-25 is 5.6875e-25, which is 0.56875e-24. So total tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, that's correct.

Next, velocity. So gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.66666667.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444444.

1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.9887, as before.

So velocity is 0.9887 c.

Now, L = c * tau * beta.

So c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So c * tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.11e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options are either ~4e-15 or ~5e-16, or similar.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for relativistic effects properly. Or perhaps I made a unit mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is not the total energy but the kinetic energy. Because the problem says "production energy is E_X=8 GeV". Hmm, maybe I should consider E_X as the kinetic energy. But wait, in particle physics, when a particle is produced, the energy is usually given as its total energy, because that's the quantity conserved in collisions. So I think my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the meson's velocity is non-relativistic, but that's unlikely given the high energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the lifetime is calculated using the relativistic gamma factor. Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime (time dilation). So, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (tau_0 = ħ / Gamma).

Wait wait, that's a good point. Because the particle is moving, its lifetime is dilated. So the lifetime we should use is tau = gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, so in my calculation earlier, I used tau = ħ / Gamma, which is proper time (tau_0). But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer: tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So that's a mistake I made. Oh no, that's a crucial mistake. Because the lifetime I used is the proper lifetime, but in reality, the lab frame measures a longer lifetime due to time dilation. So that would significantly change the result.

So let's recalculate.

Tau_lab = gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

So, gamma is 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Tau_lab = (20/3) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ).

Compute that.

(20/3) * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) = (20/3) * (20.56875e-25) ) = (20/3) * 20.56875e-25 s.

20/3 is approximately 6.6666667.

6.6666667 * 20.56875e-25 = ?

6 * 20.56875e-25 = 123.4125e-25.

0.6666667 * 20.56875e-25 = approx 13.7125e-25.

So total is 123.4125 + 13.7125 = 137.125e-25 s.

Which is 1.37125e-23 s.

So now, L = c * tau_lab * beta.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 s.

beta is 0.9887.

So compute L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s * 0.9887.

First, 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 m.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 ≈ 4.065e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 * 10^-15 m. That's very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the particle, and \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \). The steps to calculate \( L \) are as follows:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

This is the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \), but due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. Since \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667 \), we calculate:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \cdot \beta
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \), and \( \beta = 0.9887 \):

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot 0.9887
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \):

\[
c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) = 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

Now multiply by \( \beta \):

\[
L = 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \cdot 0.9887 \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.

**Answer: B**
