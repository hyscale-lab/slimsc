Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down. The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Alright, so the star has some parameters. Without spots, its radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass is 1.1 solar masses, and the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Oh, right, dark spots on the star's surface are cooler regions, so when a significant portion is covered, the star's overall brightness decreases. But wait, the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. Oh, right, because the spots are on the surface, so when the spots cover part of the surface, the overall emitted flux changes. So the effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity divided by the surface area, right.

But the main point isn't about luminosity or radius but about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio of Ti levels is lower.

The question is about finding the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Wait, the ratio (number of level 1 to level 2) is given. The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. Therefore, the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = some value greater than 1.

In stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So if I compute the ratio when T is higher (6000 K) and when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio would be...?

Wait, let me think. The energy levels: higher energy level is level 2 or level 1? The transition is from level 2 to level 1 when emitting a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. Or wait, the exact transition isn't specified, but the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1, assuming that the transition is from higher to lower. Hmm.

Actually, the exact setup of the energy levels isn't given, but the main point is that the ratio depends on the temperature. So the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2. Using the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then the exponent is negative, making the ratio small.

So for two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. Let's say level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive.

Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) * (-1?), wait, no. Wait, it's:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no:

(E2 - E1) is positive because E2 > E1.

So E1 - E2 is negative. So -(E1 - E2) is positive. So:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because E2 is higher, so the exponent is positive, meaning that the ratio is higher if T is lower. Wait, because higher T would make the exponential larger, but wait:

Wait, let's plug in numbers. Let's say E2-E1 is some positive number, say x.

Then, exponent is x/(k T).

At higher T, x/(k T) is smaller, so the exponent is smaller. So exp(small positive) is larger than exp(bigger positive). Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait, if T increases, x/(kT) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, so exp( x/(kT) ) would be larger when T is lower. Because, for example, x is fixed. So when T is 5000 K, x/(k T) is larger than when T is 6000 K.

Wait, let's compute for T1 = 6000 K and T2 =5500 K.

At T1: exp( x/(k * 6000) ) 

At T2: exp( x/(k *5500) )

Which one is bigger?

Well, 5500 is smaller than 6000, so x/(k*5500) is bigger than x/(k*6000). So exp( bigger number ) is larger. So exp( x/(k T) ) increases as T decreases. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( x/(k T) ), where x is E2-E1.

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes larger, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. That's confusing. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots (Teff=5500K), the ratio decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T is lower, the exponential increases, so ratio n1/n2 would increase. But the problem says it's lower. Hmm. So perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, perhaps the ratio they are talking about is n2/n1. Because n2 is the higher level. So, when T is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy level. So n2/n1 would be higher when T is higher.

Wait, let's re-express. The problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio of n1/n2 is lower. Or, the ratio of n2/n1 is higher.

Wait, the problem says: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots.

So let me clarify: if ratio (n1/n2) decreases when T decreases, that would mean that as T goes down, (n1/n2) goes down.

But according to our earlier analysis, (n1/n2) increases when T decreases. So that suggests that perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1). If when T decreases, (n2/n1) decreases, that would make sense.

Because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, if E2 > E1, then E2-E1 is positive, so -(E2-E1) is negative.

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

The exponent is negative, so higher T would make exp(-x/(kT)) larger (since x/(kT) is smaller, so -x/(kT) is closer to zero, and exp(0) is 1. So for example, at higher T, the exponent is larger (closer to 1), so n2/n1 is higher.

Wait, let's see with numbers: Suppose T increases from 5500 to 6000. So for T=6000, the exponent is -(x)/(k*6000). At T=5500, exponent is -(x)/(k*5500). Since 5500 is smaller, the denominator is smaller, so the exponent is more negative, making exp more smaller. So n2/n1 would be smaller when T is 5500.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute for a sample x.

Let x = E2-E1, say x is 100 kJ/mol (just as a number, doesn't matter).

At T=6000 K:

exponent = -100/(k *6000)

k is Boltzmann's constant, but in eV/K terms, but it's a proportionality. The actual numerical value is less important than the relative change.

At T=6000, exponent is -(100)/(k*6000) = -100/(6000 k) = -1/(60 k).

At T=5500, exponent is -100/(5500 k) = -1/(55 k).

So exponent is more negative at lower T. So exp(exponent) is smaller. So n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -x/(k T) ), which is smaller at lower T.

So when T decreases from 6000 to 5500, n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio (n2/n1) is lower when the star has spots, which is what the problem states. So the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio being referred to is n2/n1.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2). Hmm. So perhaps I got it wrong.

Wait, the problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, (n1/n2) lower when T is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So as T increases, the exponent increases, so (n1/n2) increases. So when T is higher, ratio is higher.

Wait, this contradicts with the problem statement. Because when T is higher (no spots, 6000K), the ratio is higher, when T is lower (spots, 5500K), the ratio is lower. So that's what the problem says. So the ratio is (n1/n2), which increases with T.

So, the ratio without spots (T=6000K) is higher than with spots (5500K), which matches the problem statement.

So, the question is to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So factor = (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = [(n1/n2)_6000] / [(n1/n2)_5500]

Which is [ (g1/g2 exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )) ] / [ (g1/g2 exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) )) ]

The g1/g2 cancels out, so factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, wait. Let me compute:

Let me write the exponents as (E2-E1)/(k T), so the ratio for each temperature is (E2-E1)/(k T).

So factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Where T1 is higher (6000) and T2 is 5500.

So, factor = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

We need to find this factor. So, let's compute the exponent.

Compute 1/6000 - 1/5500.

Let me compute that:

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4

Difference: 1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5 (since 1/6000 is smaller than 1/5500, so the difference is negative.)

Wait, but wait. Wait, 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative. So the exponent becomes (ΔE/k)(-1.515e-5).

Wait, but ΔE is E2-E1, which is positive. So the exponent is (positive) * (negative), so negative.

So factor = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = exp( (ΔE/k)(-1.515e-5) )

But wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-express.

The factor is [ ratio at T1 ] / [ ratio at T2 ]

Ratio at T is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So factor is [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because in the numerator, it's (E2-E1)/(k T1), denominator is (E2-E1)/(k T2), so when you divide, it's (1/T1)/(1/T2) )= T2/T1.

Wait, more precisely:

Numerator: (E2-E1)/(k T1 )

Denominator: (E2-E1)/(k T2 )

So (Numerator)/(Denominator) = (T2)/(T1) )

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = (E2-E1)/(k) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, let's compute 1/T1 - 1/T2.

T1=6000, T2=5500.

1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500/(3.3e7) ) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (-1.515e-5 )

But ΔE is positive, so exponent is negative, so factor is exp(negative number) which is less than one.

Wait, but earlier analysis stated that the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is higher. So when T increases, the ratio increases, so ratio(T1)/ratio(T2) is greater than 1.

But according to this calculation, the factor is exp( (ΔE/k)(1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = exp( (ΔE/k)(-1.5e-5) )

Which is exp(-something), which is less than 1. So the factor would be less than 1, which would imply that (ratio without spots) is less than (ratio with spots), which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the factor as [ratio without spots] / [ratio with spots] = (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) increases when T increases, so this ratio should be greater than 1.

But according to the exponent, [ (E2-E1)/(k 6000) ] - [ (E2-E1)/(k 5500) ] = (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) ) = (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5 )

So the exponent is negative, so the ratio is exp( negative ), which is less than 1. So that would imply (n1/n2)_6000 < (n1/n2)_5500, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should be careful about whether E2 is higher than E1. Because the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the photon emitted when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1 has wavelength 1448 Å. So E2 > E1, since it's emitting a photon when transitioning from higher to lower energy.

So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ the wavelength.

So λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 angstroms = 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = hc/λ.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) )= approx 1.373e-18 J.

That's per photon. But we want this in terms of per molecule or per atom, but perhaps it's better to convert to eV.

Because in Boltzmann factors, people often use eV and temperature in K.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems very high. Wait, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 1.373e-18 J is 1.373/(1.602) ≈ 0.857 eV? Wait, no:

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J = (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448 ) * 1e-18 = approx 1.373 * 1e-18 J.

Which is 1.373e-18 J. Divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV gives about 8.57 eV.

Wait, 8.57 eV is a big energy difference. That might be a problem because thermal energies at stellar temperatures are much lower.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for T=6000 K, kT is about 8.617e-5 *6e3 = approx 0.517 eV.

Similarly, at T=5500 K, kT≈ 8.617e-5 *5.5e3≈ 0.4739 eV.

So E2-E1 is about 8.57 eV, which is much larger than kT at either temperature (0.5 eV or 0.47 eV).

So the exponential term is exp( -8.57 / (k T) ), which is exp( -8.57 / (0.517) ) for T=6000 K.

So 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.58.

So exp(-16.58) is a very small number, about 1.2e-7.

But wait, that would mean that the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for T=6000 K, (E2-E1)/(k T) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K *6e3 K )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 0.517 eV.

So 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.58.

So exp(16.58) is a huge number, like 1e7 or so.

But wait, that can't be right because E2-E1 is much larger than kT, so level 2 is very sparsely populated. So n1 is much larger than n2, so n1/n2 is large.

But then, when T is lower, the exponential becomes even larger (since denominator is smaller, so the ratio increases. So, as T decreases, the ratio (n1/n2) increases. Which aligns with the problem statement that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting a little confused.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. But according to the calculation, when T decreases, (n1/n2) increases. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait no, the problem says when the spots are present, the Teff is 5500 K. And the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), (n1/n2) is lower. But according to our calculation, (n1/n2) increases as T decreases. So that can't be. So perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the levels wrong. Let me think: when an atom is in a higher energy level, it can transition to a lower one, emitting a photon. So E2 > E1. So the transition is from 2 to 1, emitting a photon of wavelength 1448 Å.

So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So the Boltzmann factor for n1/n2 is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But for E2-E1 >> kT, the exponential is huge, so n1 >>n2, meaning most atoms are in level 1, few in level 2.

But the problem states that when T decreases, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Which would happen only if (n1/n2) is lower at lower T. But according to the formula, (n1/n2) increases as T decreases.

So that suggests that the ratio (n1/n2) is not the one being considered. Maybe the problem is referring to (n2/n1), which would decrease with T.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases.

Wait, does that mean (n1/n2) decreases or (n2/n1) decreases?

When T is lower (spots present), (n1/n2) increases because the exponential becomes larger. So if the ratio (n1/n2) increases, then the ratio is larger when T is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean that the ratio (n1/n2) is smaller when T is lower, which contradicts with the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to (n2/n1) as the ratio. In that case, when T is lower, (n2/n1) would be smaller. Because (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Since E2 > E1, -(E2-E1) is negative. So (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -x/(k T) ), where x is positive.

As T decreases, x/(k T) increases, so exp(-x/(k T)) decreases. So (n2/n1) decreases when T decreases. Which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio being referred to is (n2/n1), which decreases when T decreases.

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Which is [ (g2/g1 exp( -(E2-E1)/(k *6000) )) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp( -(E2-E1)/(k *5500) )) ]

The g2/g1 cancels out.

So factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is the same as before, but now the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500 )

Wait, 1/6000 is about 1.6667e-4, 1/5500 is about 1.8182e-4. So 1/6000 -1/5500 is negative.

(E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is (positive) * (negative) = negative.

So factor is exp(negative) = less than 1.

So, the ratio (n2/n1) is smaller at 6000 K compared to 5500 K, but the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/6000 -1/5500) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k)*(-1.515e-5) )

Hmm, but earlier calculation of ΔE/k T gives 8.57 eV / (k T) where k T is about 0.5 eV at 6000 K.

8.57 /0.5 ≈ 17.14. So exponent is (17.14) * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -2.596e-4.

So factor ≈ exp(-0.0002596) ≈ 0.99974.

Wait, that's very close to 1. But the options given are like 1.1, 7.8, etc. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of energy levels.

Wait, let me re-calculate E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

λ =1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So E ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Yes, that's correct.

So E2-E1 = 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99430 K.

So, (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 99430 K.

So the factor exponent is (99430 K) * (1/6000 -1/5500 )

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4, 1/5500≈1.8182e-4.

So 1/6000 -1/5500 = approx (1.6667 -1.8182)*1e-4 = (-0.1515) *1e-4 = -1.515e-5.

So exponent is 99430 * (-1.515e-5 ) = let's compute that.

99430 * (-1.515e-5 ) = 

99430 * (-1.515e-5 ) = approximately -99430 * 1.515e-5

= -(99430 * 1.515 ) * 1e-5

Compute 99430 * 1.515:

Approx 99430 *1.5 = 149145, 99430 *0.015= 1491.45. So total approx 149145 +1491.45= 150,636.45.

So 150,636.45 *1e-5 = 15.0636.

So exponent is about -15.06.

So factor = exp( -15.06 ) ≈ 3.05e-7.

Wait, exp(-15) is about 3.05e-7. So factor is about 3e-7.

Wait, that's a very small factor, but the options given are nowhere near that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but if the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 -1/5500) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/k * (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) )

Wait, another way: (1/6000 -1/5500 ) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500 )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -1.515e-5.

So (E2-E1)/k is about 99430 K.

Multiply by (-1.515e-5) gives 99430 * (-1.515e-5 ) = approximately -1.506.

So exponent is -1.506.

So factor is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.221.

Which is about 0.22, which is less than 1. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ≈ 0.22.

So the ratio (n2/n1) is 0.22 times when the star has no spots versus when it has spots.

But the question is about the ratio (n1/n2). Oh, wait, no. The problem is about when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

Wait, we were considering (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ≈ 0.22.

But the ratio in the problem is (n1/n2). So (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1).

So (n1/n2)_6000 = 1/(n2/n1)_6000.

Similarly, (n1/n2)_5500 = 1/(n2/n1)_5500.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [1/(n2/n1)_6000 ] / [1/(n2/n1)_5500 ] = (n2/n1)_5500 / (n2/n1)_6000 = 1 / 0.22 ≈4.545.

Ah, so the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the answer is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the given conditions. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, and we need to determine the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does.

### Key Information:
1. **Effective Temperatures**:
   - Without spots: \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
   - With spots: \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)

2. **Energy Difference**:
   - The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), so the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
     \]
     Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:
     \[
     \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
     \[
     \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}
     \]

3. **Boltzmann Equation**:
   The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
   \]
   where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

4. **Factor of Change**:
   The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right)
   \]
   Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( \Delta E / k = 8.57 \, \text{eV} / 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \approx 99430 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = -1.515 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(99430 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5})\right) = \exp(-1.506) \approx 0.221
   \]

5. **Interpretation**:
   The factor \( \text{Factor} \approx 0.221 \) represents the ratio of \( (n_1/n_2) \) at \( T_1 \) to \( (n_1/n_2) \) at \( T_2 \). However, the problem asks for the inverse ratio: \( (n_1/n_2)_{T_2} / (n_1/n_2)_{T_1} \). This is:
   \[
   \frac{(n_1/n_2)_{T_2}}{(n_1/n_2)_{T_1}} = \frac{1}{\text{Factor}} \approx \frac{1}{0.221} \approx 4.54
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
