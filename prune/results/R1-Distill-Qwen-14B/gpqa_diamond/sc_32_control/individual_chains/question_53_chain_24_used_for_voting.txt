Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's probably a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group, typically around 1700 cm^-1. So the compound must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data: there are six signals. Let's break them down. Two aromatic-H signals. Hmm, a benzene ring with two substituents usually has some symmetry. If it's di-substituted, the substituents could be para, meta, or ortho. But the number of aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern.

Wait, the aromatic protons here are split into two signals. So maybe each substituent is in a position that causes the ring protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon, making two sets of two each, but wait, in para substitution, the ring has two equivalent H environments. Wait, no, actually, para substitution would lead to two sets of two equivalent H each. So two signals would make sense if each substituent is in a para position or maybe in another symmetric arrangement.

Wait, but wait: the problem says two signals for aromatic H. So perhaps there are two sets of aromatic protons. Let's think, for example, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring would have two sets of two equivalent H each. So two signals, each integrating for two H each. That could fit.

Next, the NMR has two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, like in an ester group. Ester groups have a carbonyl and an adjacent O-linked group. Wait, the ester functional group is O-CO-O, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-R'. But wait, the vinyl H suggests a double bond. So maybe the ester is part of a structure that includes a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Or perhaps the substituent on the ring is an ester group that's part of a vinyl group.

Wait, the vinyl Hs are split into two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighbor, while a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two sets of protons, maybe each with two neighbors.

So perhaps the ester is attached to a vinyl group. For example, if the substituent is an ester that's connected to a vinyl group, like -CO-O-R where R is CH2CH2 something. No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH, so maybe the ester is part of a group like CH2CH2CO-O-R, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a double bond adjacent to it, like an allyl ester. For example, something like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that might not be right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group connected via a double bond, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester, such as an ester with a substituent that has a double bond. For example, maybe a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2-O-CO-R? No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a ring structure with a double bond. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think about the NMR splitting.

So, the vinyl H's: one is a doublet (so maybe each of these H's is coupling with one neighboring H), and the other is a doublet of quartets. A quartet would imply three neighboring H's, but a doublet of quartets is more complicated. Maybe each H is coupling with two sets of neighboring H's, each with a different coupling constant.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ester group and two CH3 groups. So the molecular formula would include O2, and the possible options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

So the molecular formula is either 11 or 12 carbons, with 12 or 14 hydrogens, and 2 oxygen atoms.

The structure probably includes an aromatic ring (6 carbons), an ester group (which is O-CO-O, so that's three oxygen atoms? No, wait, an ester has two oxygen atoms: R-O-CO-R'. So in the formula, O2 is present.

Wait, the ester group contributes two oxygen atoms, so the molecular formula of the compound would have O2.

Now, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. Let me think about where the CH3 might be. Perhaps from the ester group. For example, if the ester is methyl something, like methyl propionate, but the substituents on the benzene could have CH3 groups.

Wait, let's think about the number of signals. Six signals in total. Two aromatic H (so maybe each is a singlet if symmetrical, but in any case, two signals), two vinyl H (so perhaps two non-equivalent H), and two CH3 groups (which could be two different CH3 groups, each giving a singlet if they're not coupled to anything else).

Wait, the CH3 groups: each would be a triplet or a singlet, depending on neighboring groups. But in the problem statement, it says two signals corresponding to â€“CH3 groups. So each CH3 is a separate signal, perhaps as singlets if not split by anything else.

So, putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group, and the other is a group that contributes the CH3 groups.

Wait, but the ester would usually be O-CO-O-R, so the R could be a CH3 or another group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are two ester groups? No, because the FTIR shows the presence of an ester, not necessarily multiple. Alternatively, each substituent could have an ester group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is something else, perhaps another group that contributes CH3.

Wait, but the molecular formula options are given, so perhaps I can calculate the molecular formula.

The total number of carbons would be the sum of the carbons from the benzene ring (6, but substituents add more) plus the substituents.

Each substituent would add some carbons. Let's see, for example, if the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R. So R could be a methyl group, which is CH3. So that substituent would have O-CO-O-CH3, which is three oxygen atoms? Wait, no, wait: an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So each ester group has two oxygen atoms. So in the molecular formula, the oxygen count is O2.

Wait, the molecular formula options are O2, so the ester contributes two O's. So if the compound has an ester group, that's O2, and perhaps another oxygen elsewhere? Wait no, because the options include O2, so maybe that's the only oxygen.

Wait, no, the ester group has two oxygen atoms, so if the compound has an ester, the O count is satisfied. So no other oxygen-containing groups.

So, substituents on the benzene ring: perhaps one is an ester group, say, O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group with CH3 groups attached.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation to figure out possible structures.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. Since no X or N are mentioned, assuming none.

Let's take the options:

Option D: C11H12O2

DoU = [2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0]/2 = (22+2-12)/2 = 12/2=6.

Which can be accounted for by a benzene ring (3 DoU) and an ester (which has a double bond in the carbonyl, 1 DoU), and another double bond elsewhere, perhaps in a vinyl group, making 3 +1 +1 =5. Wait, but 6 DoU.

Wait, 3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, and 2 more from another double bond? But that would make 6. Alternatively, one substituent could be a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure.

The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So the substituents on the benzene must have two methyl groups.

One possibility is that the substituents are two ester groups. But wait, di-substituted, so perhaps one substituent is an ester group with a methyl group, and another substituent is another group with a methyl.

Wait, another possibility: one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), where R is a methyl group (CH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to another methyl, perhaps as part of a CH2=CH- group.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR data: the vinyl protons are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. So perhaps one of the vinyl H is adjacent to only one proton, while the other is adjacent to more.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-. No, that wouldn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Then, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH-O- part. The coupling would depend on the neighboring H.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as CH2=CHCOOCH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. The compound has a benzene ring, two substituents. One substituent is an ester group. Let's say it's O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. The other substituent is a vinyl group with a CH3 attached. But that seems a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester, and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to another methyl. Hmm, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the number of protons in each NMR signal.

Six signals in total:

- 2 aromatic H.

- 2 vinyl H (each a different signal, one doublet, one doublet of quartets).

- 2 CH3 groups (each a separate signal).

So each of these groups contributes to the NMR.

The aromatic H: let's say the benzene has two substituents that cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent H. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of H: each adjacent to a substituent. Wait, but para substitution would have two equivalent H on each carbon next to the substituent. Wait, no, for para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. So the ring would have two H on each of the two adjacent carbons, but they would all be equivalent. Or wait, maybe the substituents are in positions that create different environments for the H.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are para, leading to two equivalent H on each of the adjacent carbons. So two signals, each integrating for two H. That would fit the two aromatic signals.

Then the vinyl H: suppose the substituent is an ester group attached via a vinyl group. So perhaps the structure is something like benzene with substituents O-CO-O-R and another group with a double bond and CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a CH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-O-CH2CH3, for example), and the other is a vinyl group (CH2=CH2). But that doesn't add up to the CH3 signals.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So perhaps each substituent contributes a CH3.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. Each is a separate signal, so they are not equivalent.

So one substituent might be an ester, like O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), which contributes a CH3. The other substituent could be a vinyl group attached to another CH3, like CH2=CHCH2CH3, but that would have more than one CH3, perhaps.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CHO-CO-OCH3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a vinyl group attached to another methyl group, like CH2=CHCH2CH3 (but that would have more than one CH3).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester and a propenoate group. Wait, propenoate would have a double bond and a methyl group.

Wait, let me think of a possible structure. Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, O-CO-OCH3, and the other is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2 attached to the ring. But that wouldn't give CH3 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps the other substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a vinyl group with a methyl substituent, like CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, that could be possible. Let's count the H's.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to calculate the molecular formula based on the given options.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

So the molecular weight depends on the number of H.

Looking at the NMR, the number of H in the molecule would be:

Aromatic H: 2 signals. Let's say each integrates for 2 H (since benzene has six H, di-substituted para would have two sets of two H each). Wait, but the question says two signals, so maybe each integrates for 1 H? No, that doesn't make sense with a benzene ring.

Wait, wait, perhaps the aromatic H are 2 each. So 2 H in each signal, totaling 4 H? But a benzene ring has six H, so two substituents would reduce the number of H. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the benzene would have four H: two sets of two H each. So that would give two signals, each integrating for 2 H. Then, the NMR would show two signals, each at a different chemical shift.

So the aromatic part contributes 4 H.

Then, the vinyl H: two signals, each could be 1 H. So that's 2 H.

The CH3 groups: two signals, each could be 3 H. So that's 6 H.

Wait, that adds up to 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) +6 (CH3) = 12 H. But the options have H counts of 12 or 14.

Wait, but that's only 12 H. So where are the other H?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount.

If the substituents are such that the benzene has two substituents, each substituent could contribute more H.

Wait, for example, if one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), that's O-CO-O-CH3. So that substituent contributes 3 H (from CH3).

Another substituent could be a vinyl group, perhaps a CH2=CHCH3, which would contribute 2 H on the double bond and 3 H from the CH3.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So the ester's CH3 (3 H) is one signal, and the vinyl group's CH3 (3 H) is another signal. That's two CH3 signals.

The vinyl protons would be the two H on the double bond. One H is next to another H (maybe), leading to a doublet. The other H is adjacent to two H's, leading to a quartet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent could be an ester group attached to a vinyl group, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2, but that wouldn't have a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be a propyl ester, contributing more H's. But the NMR data shows only two CH3 groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that complicates things.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a methyl ester (O-CO-OCH3) and the other is a vinyl group attached to another methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3.

So let's break that down.

The benzene ring has two substituents:

1. O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester group). This contributes 3 H from the CH3.

2. CH2=CHCH3 (vinyl group with a CH3 at the end). This contributes 2 H on the double bond (the vinyl H) and 3 H from the CH3.

So the H from the substituents would be 3 (from ester) +3 (from CH3 of vinyl) =6 H from CH3 groups.

The vinyl H: the CH2=CHCH3 group would have two vinyl H. The H on the CH2 of the double bond (CH2=CH-) would couple with the H on the adjacent CH. So, their splitting would depend on their coupling.

Wait, in CH2=CHCH3, the H on CH2 would be a doublet because they're adjacent to the H on the CH (which is part of the double bond). The H on the CH would be a triplet because they're adjacent to two H's on CH2 and perhaps another group? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl H are split into a doublet and a quartet due to coupling with adjacent H's. The first H (on CH2) would be a doublet because it's adjacent to one H (the H on the CH). The second H (on CH) would be a quartet due to coupling with two H's on CH2 and maybe another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is in a different configuration, like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached via a double bond. No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So maybe the substituent is a group where one of the vinyl H is coupled to one other H (doublet), and the other is coupled to two H's (quartet), but I'm not entirely sure.

But regardless, the substituents would contribute:

- Ester group: O-CO-OCH3 (3 H from CH3)
- Vinyl group: CH2=CHCH3 (2 H on double bond, 3 H from CH3)

So the H count from substituents is 3 (ester CH3) +3 (vinyl CH3) +2 (vinyl H) =8 H.

Plus the aromatic H: 4 H (from the substituted benzene), so total H would be 4 +8=12 H.

Wait, but looking at the options, the H counts are 12, 14, etc.

Wait, the options are:

A) C11H14O2 â†’ H=14

B) C12H14O2 â†’ H=14

C) C12H12O2 â†’ H=12

D) C11H12O2 â†’ H=12

So if the total H is 12, then options C and D are possibilities.

Now, the molecular formula: the benzene ring has 6 C. The substituents would add more C.

Ester group: O-CO-OCH3 â†’ contributes 3 C (COO and CH3).

Vinyl group: CH2=CHCH3 â†’ contributes 3 C (CH2, CH, CH3).

Wait, that's 3 +3 =6 C from substituents. Plus the benzene (6 C) â†’ total 12 C. So molecular formula would be C12H12O2 (option C), but let me double-check.

Wait, the substituents: the ester is O-CO-OCH3, which is three carbons (COO and CH3). The vinyl group is CH2=CHCH3: that's three carbons (CH2, CH, CH3). So 3 +3 =6 C from substituents. Benzene is 6 C, total 12 C.

H count: benzene gives 4 H, substituents give 3 (ester CH3) +3 (vinyl CH3) +2 (vinyl H) =8 H. So 4 +8=12 H. O is from ester: two O's.

So molecular formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because the ester group is O-CO-O-R. R is CH3. So the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is three carbons (COO and CH3). The other substituent is CH2=CHCH3, which is three carbons. So 3 +3=6, plus the benzene ring's 6 â†’ 12 C.

Hydrogens: benzene substituents contribute 4 H. The ester contributes 3 H from CH3. The vinyl group contributes 5 H: 3 from CH3 and 2 from double bond. So 3+5=8. Plus 4 â†’ 12 H.

So the formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the options are given as C11H12O2 (D), C12H12O2 (C), etc. So option C is C12H12O2.

But wait, let me recount the substituents' carbons. The ester substituent is -O-CO-OCH3. So the carbonyl is one C, the two O's, and the CH3 is another C. So the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3: that's 3 carbons (the carbonyl C, the O connected to the benzene, and the CH3 C).

Wait, no, wait:

The substituent is O-CO-OCH3. So the structure is benzene-O-CO-OCH3. So the O is attached to the benzene, then the carbonyl (C=O), then an O connected to CH3. So that's three carbons in the substituent: the benzene O is attached to a C (carbonyl C), which is connected to another O, which is connected to CH3. So the substituent has two carbons: the carbonyl C and the CH3 C. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a single C, then OCH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is three carbons: the benzene O is connected to a C (carbonyl), which is connected to O, which is connected to CH3. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH3: three carbons (the COO part is two C's, but wait, COO is one C with double bond O and another O attached. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 â†’ that's two carbons: the COO C and the CH3 C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me count:

The substituent is O-CO-OCH3.

Breaking it down:

- O attached to benzene.
- Then a carbonyl group: C=O.
- Then an ester oxygen (O) connected to CH3.

So the substituent is -O-CO-OCH3.

Which has three carbons in the substituent:

1. The C in the carbonyl (COO).
2. The OCH3 group (CH3).

Wait, no, the COO is part of the substituent. The substituent is -O-CO-O-CH3.

So the carbons are:

- The O attached to the benzene is part of the substituent, but it's an O, not a C.
- The carbonyl C is one carbon.
- The OCH3 has another carbon (the methyl C).

So the substituent has two carbons in the ester group. So the substituent is two carbons.

The other substituent is CH2=CHCH3. That's three carbons.

So total substituent carbons: 2 (ester) +3 (vinyl) =5.

Plus benzene's 6 C: 6+5=11 C.

Wait, that's only 11 C. So the molecular formula would be C11H??O2.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

If the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (ester), that's two carbons in the substituent (the carbonyl C and the CH3 C). The other substituent is CH2=CHCH3, which is three carbons. So substituents contribute 2 +3 =5 C. Benzene is 6 â†’ 6+5=11 C, so molecular formula would be C11H?O2.

Now, the H count: benzene substituents contribute 4 H. The ester's CH3 gives 3 H, the vinyl group gives 3 H (from CH3) and 2 H (from the double bond), so 3+2=5 H. Plus the 4 â†’ 4+5=9 H? No, that can't be.

Wait, no, the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CHCH3.

So the ester substituent O-CO-OCH3 contributes 3 H (from CH3).

The vinyl substituent CH2=CHCH3 contributes 3 H (from CH3) and 2 H (from CH2=CH). So that's 5 H.

Plus the benzene substituents, which contribute 4 H.

So total H =4 +3 +5 =12 H.

So the molecular formula is C11 (6 benzene +5 substituents) â†’ Wait, substituents are 2 (ester) +3 (vinyl) =5 â†’ 6+5=11 C.

H=12.

O is 2.

So the formula is C11H12O2, which is option D.

Wait, earlier I thought substituent carbons were 6 (but that's incorrect). No, substituents are 5 C: 2 from ester, 3 from vinyl.

So 6 (benzene) +5 (substituents) =11 C.

H: 12.

So the formula is C11H12O2 â†’ option D.

But wait, the substituents on the benzene are two, so each substituent is either O-CO-OCH3 or CH2=CHCH3. So with two substituents, each adds their own carbons.

Wait, the di-substituted benzene has two substituents. So each substituent's carbons are added to the benzene.

So O-CO-OCH3 is one substituent (contributing 2 C: the carbonyl C and the CH3 C).

CH2=CHCH3 is another substituent (3 C). So substituents contribute 2+3=5 C. Benzene is 6 â†’ total 6+5=11 C.

H: benzene substituents contribute 4 H (2 each, two signals). Ester substituent's CH3 â†’3 H. Vinyl substituent: CH3 (3 H) and two H on double bond â†’ 5 H. Plus 4 H â†’ 4+3+5=12 H.

So the formula is C11H12O2 â†’ option D.

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option D is C11H12O2.

So the correct answer should be D.

But wait, earlier I thought it was C, but now I'm getting D.

Wait, I'm going back and forth. Did I make a mistake in counting substituent carbons?

Yes, because each substituent adds its own carbons. So:

O-CO-OCH3 substituent: contributes 2 carbons (the carbonyl C and the CH3 C).

CH2=CHCH3 substituent: contributes 3 carbons.

So substituents: 2 +3 =5 C.

Benzene:6 C.

Total C:6+5=11 â†’ molecular formula C11H12O2 â†’ option D.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals corresponding to aromatic protons suggest a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, resulting in two sets of equivalent protons (4 aromatic hydrogens total).
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals corresponding to vinyl protons, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicate the presence of a vinyl group (2 vinyl hydrogens total).
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals corresponding to â€“CH3 groups suggest two distinct methyl groups (6 methyl hydrogens total).

### Molecular Formula Analysis
The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons. Each substituent adds additional carbons:
- The ester group (O-CO-OCH3) contributes 2 carbons (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon).
- The vinyl group (CH2=CHCH3) contributes 3 carbons.

Thus, the total number of carbons is:
\[
6 \, (\text{benzene}) + 2 \, (\text{ester}) + 3 \, (\text{vinyl}) = 11 \, \text{carbons}.
\]

The total number of hydrogens is calculated as follows:
- Aromatic protons: 4 hydrogens.
- Vinyl protons: 2 hydrogens.
- Methyl groups: 6 hydrogens.
- Additional hydrogens from the ester and vinyl groups: 3 (from the methyl group in the ester) + 2 (from the vinyl group) = 5 hydrogens.

Thus, the total number of hydrogens is:
\[
4 \, (\text{aromatic}) + 2 \, (\text{vinyl}) + 6 \, (\text{methyl}) + 5 \, (\text{additional}) = 17 \, \text{hydrogens}.
\]

However, the NMR data indicates only 12 hydrogens are observed, which aligns with the molecular formula **C11H12O2**. This accounts for all the observed signals and matches the given data.

### Conclusion
The molecular formula of the compound is **C11H12O2**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
