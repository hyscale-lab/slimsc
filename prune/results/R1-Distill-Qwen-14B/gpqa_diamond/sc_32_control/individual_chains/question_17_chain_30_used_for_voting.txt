Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions when it's in a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions.

Wait, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the solution's concentration of the free metal ion depends on the formation constant and the concentration of the complex. The formula I think is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, wait. Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it usually forms complexes like CaEDTA²- or something similar. So the formation constant K represents the stability of the complex.

In this problem, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M. But because the complex dissociates a little, the actual [Ca²+] will be much less. The problem says that the pH is ideal, so activity coefficients are probably being neglected, and we can treat concentrations as if they're activities.

So the formula would be K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Wait, but in solution, the EDTA is in its deprotonated form, right? Because pH affects the speciation of EDTA. But the problem states the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- (the fully deprotonated form) is known or can be considered as a constant... Wait, but in this case, the solution is just the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, when you have 0.02 M CaEDTA^2- (assuming that's the complex), it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the complex is Ca-EDTA, which is a 1:1 complex. So the stoichiometry is 1 Ca²+ to 1 EDTA^4-.

So the reaction is:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So at equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M minus the amount that dissociates. But since K is a huge number (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. Therefore, the [CaEDTA²-] is approximately 0.02 M.

Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then [EDTA^4-] would also be x, because for each x amount of Ca²+ released, the same x comes from EDTA^4-.

So substituting into K:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / (x²) = 5e10.

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12. So x² = 4e-13? Wait, 2e-2 is 0.02, 0.02 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12. Let me calculate that:

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7 approximately. So 2 * 3.16e-7 → about 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, so that's [Ca²+] is approx 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. K = [complex]/([M][L]). So [complex] is 0.02 M.

K = 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2). So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 0.02/5e10.

0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12, so x^2=4e-13, x=2e-6.5=2*(1e-6.5). 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) = 1e-6.5 = approximately 3.16e-7. So x is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K \), which is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\), is approximately 0.02 M (since the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large \( K \)). At equilibrium, the concentrations of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) are equal, denoted as \( x \). Substituting these into the equation:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
