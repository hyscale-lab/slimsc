Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is at rest, so that should simplify things a bit. The rest masses are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. Wait, and I guess the nu here is a neutrino, which has a negligible rest mass, right? Or maybe it's treated as massless in these kinds of problems? I think that's the case because neutrinos have very tiny masses, and in particle physics problems, they're often assumed to be zero unless stated otherwise.

So, the problem is about calculating the kinetic energy of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Conservation of energy also applies here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After the decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Let me jot down the conservation equations.

Energy conservation:
m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation:
p_mu = -p_nu

Since the neutrino is massless (we'll assume that), its energy is just E_nu = p_nu * c. And the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). 

Wait, but since p_mu = -p_nu, the magnitudes are the same. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of the muon, then the neutrino's momentum is p (same magnitude but opposite direction).

So, E_nu = p c.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

Putting into energy conservation:

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c

Hmm, I can factor out c^2. Let's divide both sides by c^2 to make it easier.

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + (m_mu)^2 ) + (p * (1/c)) * c^2? Wait, maybe I should not have done that. Let me restructure.

Wait, the equation is:

m_pi c^2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c

Let me factor c^2 out from the square root:

sqrt( c^2 (p^2 + m_mu^2 c^2) ) = c * sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 c^2 )

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The expression sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) is equal to sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c * sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 c^2 ). Because, factor c^2:

c^2 (p^2 + m_mu^2 c^2) under the square root. So no, that's not correct. Let me see:

Wait, (p c)^2 is p^2 c^2. (m_mu c^2)^2 is m_mu² c^4.

So sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_mu² c^4 ) = c * sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² c^2 )

Ah, okay. So the equation becomes:

m_pi c^2 = c * sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² c^2 ) + p c

Divide both sides by c to simplify:

m_pi c = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² c^2 ) + p

Hmm, that's better. Let me rearrange this equation. Let's subtract p from both sides:

m_pi c - p = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² c^2 )

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root.

( m_pi c - p )^2 = p^2 + m_mu² c^2

Expanding the left side:

(m_pi c)^2 - 2 m_pi c p + p^2 = p^2 + m_mu² c^2

The p^2 terms on both sides cancel out. So:

(m_pi c)^2 - 2 m_pi c p = m_mu² c^2

Let me solve for p.

Move the m_pi term to the right:

-2 m_pi c p = m_mu² c^2 - (m_pi c)^2

Multiply both sides by (-1):

2 m_pi c p = (m_pi c)^2 - m_mu² c^2

Factor out c² on the right:

2 m_pi c p = c^2 ( m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 )

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c:

p = [ c^2 ( m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) ] / ( 2 m_pi c )

Simplify this:

p = [ c ( m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) ] / ( 2 m_pi )

But wait, the masses are given in MeV/c². Let me clarify the units. Since m_pi is 139.6 MeV/c², and m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c².

So, m_pi^2 is (139.6)^2 (MeV²/c^4), and similarly for m_mu. So when we compute (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) in (MeV^2/c^4), and multiply by c^2 (because of the [ c^2 ] in the numerator), let's see.

Wait, the calculation for p is:

p = [ c ( m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) ] / ( 2 m_pi )

But m_pi and m_mu are in MeV/c². Let me compute m_pi^2 - m_mu^2:

m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 ≈ 19488.16 (MeV/c²)^2

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2 ≈ 11172.49 (MeV/c²)^2

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ≈ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ≈ 8315.67 (MeV²/c^4)

So plug this into p:

p = c * (8315.67 MeV²/c^4) / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV/c² )

Simplify the units:

c * [ (MeV²/c^4) ] / [ 2 * (MeV/c²) ) ] = c * (MeV²/c^4) * (c² / MeV) ) / 2

Wait, let's compute the unit cancellation:

The denominator is 2 * 139.6 (MeV/c²)

So:

Numerator: 8315.67 MeV²/c^4 * c

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 MeV/c²

So, the c in the numerator and c^4 in the denominator give c^(-3). But the denominator also has c^(-2), so overall:

c^(-3) * c^2 = c^(-1). But let's check:

Wait, the numerator is 8315.67 * c * (MeV²/c^4) → units: (MeV²) * c * (1/c^4) ) → MeV² / c^3.

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 (MeV/c²) → units: MeV / c².

So, (MeV² / c^3) / (MeV / c²) ) → (MeV² / c^3) * (c² / MeV) ) → MeV / c 

So, the unit for p is MeV/c.

Which makes sense for momentum (MeV/c is a standard unit for momentum in particle physics). 

So, let's compute the value numerically.

p = [ 8315.67 MeV²/c^4 * c ] / [ 2 * 139.6 MeV/c² ]

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator numerically.

Numerator: 8315.67 * c (but in terms of unit conversion, perhaps I should just compute the numbers).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the numeric value. Let me plug in the numbers:

p = [ c * (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) ] / ( 2 * 139.6 )

Let me compute (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 first. 

Alternatively, factor it as (a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b). 

a=139.6, b=105.7.

a + b = 245.3

a - b = 33.9

So (a^2 - b^2) = 33.9 * 245.3 ≈ ?

33.9 * 245.3:

33 * 245 = 8115, 0.9 * 245 = 220.5 → 8335.5, but more accurately:

33.9 * 245.3 = ?

Let me compute 33.9 * 245 = 33.9 * 200=6780, 33.9 *45=1525.5, so total 8305.5. Then 33.9 * 0.3 = 10.17 → total 8315.67, which matches earlier calculation. 

So, p = [ c * (8315.67) ] / ( 2 * 139.6 )

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So p = (8315.67) / 279.2 * (c)

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2 → let me do this division.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (because 279.2 * 30=8376, which is larger than 8315.67)

So 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87

So 29 + (218.87 / 279.2) → 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So p ≈ 29.783 (MeV/c).

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the units again. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, wait. No, the p was (c * (8315.67 MeV²/c^4)) / (2 * 139.6 MeV/c² )

So, let's compute 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) first. 

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 → let me compute that.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. As before.

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So 29.783 → so p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but that can't be right because the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and its kinetic energy would be lower than that, but let's not get confused; perhaps I should proceed.

Now, once I have p, I can compute the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but the question is about the kinetic energy of the product particles. The neutrino is massless, so its energy is all kinetic, because its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu = p c. 

For the muon, its total energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). So the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c^2.

Let me compute KE_mu and KE_nu.

First, compute p = approx 29.783 MeV/c.

So,

KE_nu = p c ≈ 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the units are MeV/c for p, so p c is (MeV/c) * c → MeV. So that's correct.

Now, for the muon:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

So (p c) is 29.783 MeV, and (m_mu c^2) is 105.7 MeV.

So,

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 886.86 + 11172.49 ) → sqrt( 12059.35 ) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Then, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Because energy conservation says m_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu.

m_pi c^2 is 139.6 MeV.

So E_mu + E_nu = 109.81 + 29.783 ≈ 139.593 MeV, which is close to 139.6, so that seems correct.

So, KE_mu is approximately 4.11 MeV, and KE_nu is approximately 29.78 MeV. 

Wait, but looking at the options provided:

Options:
A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV
B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV
C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV
D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV

So, the KE_mu is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV. So the option closest is D) 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but option D lists 4.12 for KE_mu and 29.8 for KE_nu. So that's the correct option.

But wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier because when I computed p, I might have messed up the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this with the invariant mass approach or use the conservation equations more accurately.

Another approach is to consider that in the rest frame of the pion, the total energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino must share this energy, and their momenta must balance.

So, let me denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu, and their momenta as p_mu and p_nu.

Since the pion is at rest, p_mu = -p_nu → |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 → E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) * c^2, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Alternatively, since I'm working in units where c=1 (MeV and MeV/c for momentum), perhaps it's easier.

So, let me set c=1 for simplicity. Then the equations become:

Energy conservation: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation: p_mu = -p_nu → p_mu = p, p_nu = p (but opposite direction).

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

E_nu = p (since for a massless particle, E = |p| )

So, substituting into energy conservation:

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p

Which is the same equation as before. 

Let me solve for p numerically.

Given m_pi=139.6, m_mu=105.7.

So,

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p

Let me let x = p. So:

139.6 = sqrt(x^2 + 105.7² ) + x

Subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt( x^2 + 105.7^2 )

Square both sides:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2

Expand left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x² = x² + 105.7²

Cancel x² on both sides:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x = 105.7^2

Compute 139.6^2: 139.6 *139.6 = let's compute 140^2 =19600, minus 0.4*(2*140 -0.4) → 19600 - (1.12) → 19598.88? Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute directly.

139.6 * 139.6 = ?

Let me compute 139 *139 = 19321. Then, 0.6 * (139 +139) = 0.6 * 278=166.8. Then, 0.6^2=0.36. So, 139.6^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16. Same as before.

Similarly, 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So,

19488.16 - 2*139.6 x = 11172.49

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 -11172.49 = 2*139.6 x → 8315.67 = 2*139.6 x

So x = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6 ) → 8315.67/(279.2) ≈ 29.783.

So p ≈29.783 MeV/c.

Then, E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → sqrt( 887.07 + 11172.49 ) → sqrt( 12059.56 ) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

E_nu = p =29.783 MeV.

So KE_nu is 29.783 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches closely.

Wait, but the option D lists KE_mu as 4.12 MeV and KE_nu as 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary. The rest masses are given as:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved:  
   \[
   m_{\pi^+} c^2 = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]  
   Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy, \(m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\).

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   The pion has zero initial momentum, so the total momentum of the products must cancel:  
   \[
   \vec{p}_{\mu^+} = -\vec{p}_\nu \quad \Rightarrow \quad |\vec{p}_{\mu^+}| = |\vec{p}_\nu| = p.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
- The muon's total energy is given by:  
  \[
  E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}.
  \]  
  Its kinetic energy is:  
  \[
  KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2.
  \]

- The neutrino's energy is purely kinetic since it is massless:  
  \[
  KE_\nu = E_\nu = p c.
  \]

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
Using energy conservation:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}\) and \(E_\nu = p c\):  
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} + p c.
\]  
Dividing through by \(c^2\) and simplifying:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + \frac{p}{c}.
\]  
Rearranging and solving for \(p\):  
\[
m_{\pi^+} - \frac{p}{c} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]  
Squaring both sides and simplifying:  
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]  
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 2 m_{\pi^+} p.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):  
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy:**  
   \[
   KE_\nu = p c = 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon's Kinetic Energy:**  
   The muon's total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} = \sqrt{(29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   Its kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options:  
- **Option D:** \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\) matches closely.
