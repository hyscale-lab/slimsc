Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

So, the question is about a star with some specific characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And we can assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this calculation.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n is the number of atoms in each level.
- g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of each level.
- E is the energy of each level.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 is lower. That suggests that when the star is cooler (with spots, T=5500 K), the relative population of the upper level (level 2) decreases compared to level 1. So, the ratio is lower.

But the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to with spots. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Because the ratio decreases when spots are present, so (n2/n1)_no_spots is higher than (n2/n1)_with_spots. So the factor is greater than 1.

But wait, the ratio when spots are present is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots.

So, our factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots. Or, since (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), multiplied by the statistical weights.

So let's write it as:

Factor = [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Wait, T1 is 6000 K (no spots), T2 is 5500 K (with spots). So the g2/g1 cancels out, because both numerator and denominator have the same g2/g1. So the factor simplifies to exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( (ΔE/(k T2) ) - (ΔE/(k T1)) )  ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

But wait, ΔE is E2 - E1, right? So that's positive if E2 > E1. Which makes sense because we have an upper and lower energy level.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the denominator. Let me double-check.

If the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, when the temperature is lower, the exponent is more negative, meaning the ratio is smaller. So when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, which matches the problem statement.

But the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let's compute the exponent:

(ΔE)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, 1/T2 is about 1/5500, and 1/T1 is 1/6000. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive, because 1/5500 is bigger than 1/6000.

So the exponent is positive, which makes the factor greater than 1. Which makes sense because (n2/n1)_no_spots is larger than (n2/n1)_with_spots.

But wait, wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n2/n1)_with_spots is lower than (n2/n1)_no_spots. So the factor is indeed greater than 1.

But let's think about the wavelength given, 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range (since 1000 Å is UV). The transition's wavelength is λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 1e-10 meters.

Using the relation E=hc/λ, we can compute ΔE in terms of temperature.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (n2/n1) for both temperatures and take the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the ratio of the exponents.

Let me compute the exponent for T1 and T2.

Let me denote x = (E2 - E1)/(k). So the exponent for T1 is -x/T1, for T2 it's -x/T2.

So the ratio between the two exponents is:

exp( ( -x/T1 ) ) / exp( (-x/T2) ) ) = exp( (x/T2) - (x/T1) ) = exp( x (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is the same as earlier.

Alternatively, the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But to compute this, I need to know ΔE.

But since the wavelength is given, and the energy difference is E = hc/(λ), so ΔE = hc/(λ).

So let's compute ΔE.

But wait, we can compute this in terms of the temperature, perhaps using the relation between energy and temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps we can avoid computing absolute values by using the ratio.

Wait, perhaps substituting T1 and T2.

Let me compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = let's calculate that.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 per K.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 per K.

So the difference is approximately 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 per K.

But wait, wait, 1/5500 is 0.000181818 K^-1, and 1/6000 is 0.000166667 K^-1. So the difference is 0.000015151 K^-1.

Hmm, so Δ is 0.000015151 per Kelvin.

Now, the exponent is (ΔE)/(k) * (0.000015151)

But ΔE is hc/λ.

Let me compute hc/λ. 

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ:

hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / (1448e-10) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Hmm, but I need to convert this into units of energy that can be compared to k*T.

Wait, k is Boltzmann constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, k*T is in J. Let me compute k*T for both T1 and T2.

At T1=6000 K: k*T1 = 1.38e-23 * 6000 = 8.28e-20 J.

At T2=5500 K: k*T2 = 1.38e-23 *5500 ≈ 7.59e-20 J.

But wait, I need to compute (ΔE)/(k) for each temperature.

Wait, no, let me think again. The exponent is (ΔE / (k T)).

Wait, no. The exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T), which is (hc/λ)/(k T) = (h c) / (k T λ).

So, the ratio is exp [ (h c) / (k λ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Wait, yes, because (1/T2 -1/T1) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), but I can compute it as is.

So let me compute the term inside the exponent:

(h c) / (k λ) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Substituting the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

λ = 1448e-10 m

Compute (h c) / (k λ):

(6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *1448e-10 = 1.38e-23 *1.448e-7 = 1.38 * 1.448e-30 ≈ 1.99824e-30 J·m

So (h c)/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.99824e-30 ) ≈ 1.0e5 (since 1e-25 /1e-30 = 1e5)

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1.99824e-30 ≈ approx 1.0e5, because 1.9878 / 1.99824 is about 0.995, so roughly 9.95e4 or about 1e5.

So (h c)/(k λ) ≈ 1e5.

Now, multiply by (1/T2 -1/T1 ):

We already found (1/T2 -1/T1) is about 0.000015151 K^-1.

So 1e5 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.5151.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5151.

So the factor is exp(1.5151) ≈ e^1.5151.

What's e^1.5151? Well, e^1 is 2.718, e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is around 4.4817.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.5151 is approximately 1.515.

e^1.5 = 4.4816890703.

e^1.5151 = ?

Let me compute the value step by step.

We can approximate e^x around x=1.5.

Let me consider x=1.5151.

The difference from 1.5 is 0.0151.

We can use the Taylor expansion: e^(a + b) ≈ e^a * (1 + b + b^2/2), where a=1.5, b=0.0151.

So e^1.5151 ≈ e^1.5 * (1 + 0.0151 + (0.0151)^2 / 2 )

Compute each term:

0.0151^2 = approx 0.000228.

Divide by 2: 0.000114.

So 1 +0.0151 + 0.000114 = 1.015214.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

So 4.4817 * 1.015214 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.015214 )

Compute 4.4817 *0.015214:

0.01 *4.4817=0.044817

0.005214 *4.4817 ≈ approx 0.0234 (since 0.005 is 0.0224085, 0.000214 is about 0.00096)

Total ≈ 0.044817 + 0.0234 ≈ 0.0682.

So 4.4817 + 0.0682 ≈ 4.5499, approximately 4.55.

Wait, but this is a rough approximation. Let me check using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that ln(4.55) is around 1.515.

Wait, ln(4.5) is about 1.5041. Let me compute ln(4.55):

Compute ln(4.55):

We can use that ln(4) is 1.386, ln(5)=1.609.

4.55 is between 4 and 5. Let me compute ln(4.55) = ?

Alternatively, use the approximation:

But perhaps it's better to compute e^1.5151 numerically.

But perhaps a better way is to compute 1.5151 divided into known exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator.

But given that, perhaps the factor is approximately 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is very close.

But wait, the exponent was 1.515, which makes e^1.515 ≈4.55.

But wait, let me recheck if I did the initial calculations correctly.

Wait, I had (h c)/(k λ) ≈ 1e5.

But let me recompute that step, because that's critical.

Compute (h c)/(k λ):

h =6.626e-34 J s

c=3e8 m/s.

h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

λ=1448e-10 m.

k λ=1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 = 1.38e-23 *1.448e-7 = 1.38 *1.448e-30.

1.38 *1.448 = approx 2. (1.38*1.4=1.932, 1.38*0.048≈0.066 → total≈2.0.)

So k λ ≈2e-30 J m.

So (h c)/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25 ) / (2e-30 ) = (1.9878/2) * 1e5 = ~0.9939e5 ≈9.939e4 ≈9.94e4.

So about 99,400.

Wait, earlier I approximated it as 1e5, which is close enough for this purpose.

So 9.94e4 times (1/T2 -1/T1) = 0.000015151 K^-1.

So 9.94e4 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.508.

So the exponent is approximately 1.508.

So e^1.508 ≈?

e^1.5 is about 4.4817. What about e^0.008?

e^0.008 ≈ 1 + 0.008 + (0.008)^2/2 ≈1.008032.

So e^1.508 = e^1.5 * e^0.008 ≈4.4817 *1.008032 ≈4.520.

So the factor is approximately 4.52.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots, which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) )= exp(1.508) ≈4.52.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the factor is the ratio without spots over with spots. So the factor is 4.5, so the answer is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their degeneracies, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning the effective temperature of the star is lower (\(T_{\text{with spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\)) compared to when it is spot-free (\(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\)). The wavelength of the transition between the two energy levels is given as \(1448 \, \text{Å}\), which allows us to compute \(\Delta E\) using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E\)
\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors
The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{with spots}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{no spots}}}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{with spots}}}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
First, calculate the temperature terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, compute \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4.
\]

Now, calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (9.94 \times 10^4)(1.51 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.51.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.51) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
