Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, let me recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model is. I think it's a model that considers both the rotational and vibrational energies of a diatomic molecule. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, that might be a bit different. In the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, which connects to the vibrational energy.

But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational level and the lowest rotational level. Hmm. So if the molecule is in its ground state, what's the next state? The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the first excited vibrational state. Because the rotational states have quantized energy levels as well, but maybe in this case, the vibrational transition is what's being considered.

Wait, no, the problem says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so both vibrations and rotations contribute to the energy. But the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state could be a combination of a higher rotational state and the same vibrational state, or a higher vibrational state and the same rotational state.

Wait, but the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the energy is as low as possible, so probably a vibrational transition from the ground state. Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized as well.

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic's vibration are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, it's E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

In the fundamental state, I think v=0 and J=0, so the lowest energy. The next state with the lowest energy would be the first excited state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which one has lower energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational levels. Because for vibrations, the energy increases a lot with each v, whereas for rotations, it's a bit more spaced. So for hydrogen, even J=1 is a low energy state. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure about the energy scales here.

Wait, let me think about the energy of the first vibrational level. The vibrational energy for v=1 is (1 + 1/2) h ν = (3/2) h ν. The rotational energy for J=1 is [1(2) ] ħ²/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller: (3/2) h ν or ħ²/(I)? Let's calculate both.

Given the values in the problem: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.013e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

The moment of inertia I is μ R². So I = 3.013e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.013e-27 *4e-20 = approx 1.205e-46 kg m².

Angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy step is hν, where ν is ω/(2π), but wait, actually in the energy formula, E_v is (v + 1/2) hν, so the difference between v=1 and v=0 is hν. So for a photon to cause a transition from v=0 to v=1, the photon's energy must be hν. So the energy change is hν.

Alternatively, the rotational transition would require a photon with energy corresponding to the rotational energy change. Let's calculate which is smaller.

Energy for vibrational transition, ΔE_vib = hν.

Energy for rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1: ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0. E_J=0 is (0(1)ħ²)/(2I) = 0, so E_J=1 is (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So let's compute both:

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. ν is 4e14 Hz (since ω=2πν → ν=ω/(2π)= 4e14 / (6.28) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz). Wait, no, wait: ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ν = ω/(2π) ≈ 4e14 / 6.28 ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

So hν = 6.626e-34 J s * 6.37e13 Hz ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Now for the rotational energy change: ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.05e-34 J s. So ħ² is about 1.1e-68 J² s².

I is 1.205e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.1e-68 / 1.205e-46 ≈ 9.13e-23 J.

So compare 4.21e-20 J (vibrational) and 9.13e-23 J (rotational). The rotational is much smaller. So the next higher energy state would be the rotational one, because it requires less energy.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So if both transitions (vibrational or rotational) are possible, which requires lower energy? The rotational is lower. So the photon should provide the rotational energy, right?

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest possible. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the first rotationally excited state. Because the energy required for that is much lower than the vibrational transition.

So the photon must have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

So the energy of the photon is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) * 2 (since J goes from 0 to 1, change is 2 in E_J).

Wait, J=0 to J=1: E_J=1 is (1)(2)ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So the energy difference is ħ²/(I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So the photon's energy must be ħ²/(I).

How does that translate to momentum? Because photon momentum p is related to energy E by E = pc. Because for photons, E = pc, since their mass is zero (relativistic relation).

So p = E / c. 

So p = (ħ²/(I)) / c.

Let me compute that.

Compute ħ²/(I), which is the energy.

Earlier, I calculated ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.13e-23 J.

So p = 9.13e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.04e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are that small. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Let me recompute I.

I = μ R².

μ is the reduced mass. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Wait, yeah that's correct.

Now ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Then p = E/c = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 1.9e-28 Ns. Hmm, wait, 3e-31 is way smaller than the options.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which might be considering both rotational and vibrational transitions. Or perhaps, the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule moving from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher energy state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But if the molecule can't have a vibrational transition (maybe it's in a rigid rotor model), but the problem says it's a non-rigid rotor, which means the bond can stretch, so vibrational transitions are possible.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the rotational transition.

But the calculation I did earlier gave a momentum that isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, because that's the next state in the rotation-vibration model.

Wait, but the vibrational transition would require more energy than the rotational. But according to the question, it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state.

But then why is the photon's momentum not matching any options? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units? Let me calculate everything again.

Compute I again:

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

R=2 angstroms → 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Compute ħ²/(I):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 = 9.22e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Photon momentum p = E/c. c=3e8 m/s.

p = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Convert to N s: since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s, so that's 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 or 1e-28, which are larger. So this suggests I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the molecule transitioning to the next state, which is the first vibrational state, not the rotational. But then the energy would be hν, and the momentum p would be hν/c.

Let's compute that.

hν = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s. Wait, no, wait: ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. But ν (frequency) is ω/(2π) ≈ 4e14 /6.28 ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

So hν = 6.626e-34 J s * 6.37e13 Hz ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

p = hν/c =4.21e-20 /3e8 = 1.403e-28 kg m/s = 1.403e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N s. Hmm, that's close.

So then, perhaps the question is assuming that the next state is the vibrational transition, which would require a photon of energy hν, leading to p=1.4e-28 N s.

But why would the rotational transition require a larger photon energy? Because the calculation gave a much smaller p for the rotational transition. So that would mean that the rotational transition is lower in energy than the vibrational.

But the options don't have such a small p. So perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition as the next state.

Wait, maybe the model is such that the next state is a vibrational state. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is combining both rotational and vibrational transitions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest possible. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that requires the least energy to reach. So that would be the rotational transition, but the momentum I calculated (3e-31 Ns) is way lower than any of the options. So perhaps the problem is considering a vibrational transition, giving an answer of approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used in the problem includes both rotational and vibrational contributions, but the way the question is phrased isn't clear. But looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is close to the calculation for the vibrational transition.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. But stepping back, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the photon must cause a transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a vibrational state, as that would require a photon of energy hν.

So the momentum p is hν/c = (6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s)/(3e8 m/s). Wait, but I think I made a mistake here because ω is given, not ν.

Wait, ω is angular frequency, which is 2πν. So ν = ω/(2π) = 4e14 / (6.283) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

So hν = 6.626e-34 * 6.37e13 ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

p = hν/c = 4.21e-20 /3e8 = 1.403e-28 kg m/s = 1.403e-28 N s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N s.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its ground state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational energy levels: \(v = 0\) and \(J = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v = 1, J = 0\)) or a rotational transition (\(v = 0, J = 1\)).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for a vibrational transition is given by:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu
     \]
     where \(\nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}\) is the vibrational frequency, and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\) is the angular frequency.
   - Substituting \(\nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}\), and \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h\nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})(6.37 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.403 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for a rotational transition from \(J = 0\) to \(J = 1\) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
     \]
     where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\), and \(I = \mu R^2\) is the moment of inertia.
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \cdot 2 \, \text{amu}}{22 \, \text{amu}} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), so:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27})(2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg m}^2
     \]
   - Substituting into \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum for this transition is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N s}
     \]

### Analysis:
- The vibrational transition requires a photon with momentum \(p \approx 1.403 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}\), which matches option **D**.
- The rotational transition requires a photon with momentum \(p \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N s}\), which is much smaller than any of the given options.
- Since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the vibrational transition is more likely being considered, as it aligns with the given options.

### Conclusion:
The photon must have a momentum of approximately \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}\) to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.
