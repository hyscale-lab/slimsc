Alright, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

Okay, the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, which is interesting. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star since the orbital period is shorter.

Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit because eccentricity doesn't play a role here. Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved—maybe a subgiant or something—but same size as Planet_1's star.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is roughly given by the formula:

Probability ≈ (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet

But wait, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), assuming the planet's size is much smaller than the star's, which is usually the case for Earth-like planets. So when R_planet is much less than R_star, the probability is approximately (R_star) / (a_planet). But wait, I think I might have it backwards. Because a larger semi-major axis (a_planet) means the planet is farther away, which would make the transit less likely.

Wait, no. The formula for the transit probability isn't just R/a. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the size of the planet's orbit, so it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else. Or wait, maybe it's the size of the star's disk compared to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability (for a randomly oriented orbit) is given by:

P ≈ (R_star / a_planet) * (R_star / a_planet), but that might not be right. Wait, no. Wait, I think I got it wrong. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbit, but considering the geometry. Oh, right! The probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?)... Wait, no—I think the correct formula is:

P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) 

But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the term (R_planet / R_star) is negligible, so P ≈ R_star / a_planet.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if a_planet is larger, then R_star / a_planet is smaller, which would mean lower transit probability. So a planet closer to its star (smaller a_planet) would have a higher probability of transiting because a_planet is smaller, making R_star / a_planet larger.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So for a closer planet (smaller a), the probability is higher because the ratio R_star / a is larger. So the closer the planet is to the star, the higher the chance of a transit.

So the transit probability is proportional to R_star * / a_planet. So, let's write that down.

Given that, we can model P1 and P2.

P1 is the probability for Planet_1, P2 for Planet_2.

We can express each P as (R_star / a_planet).

But we need to find a_planet for each. Since we know the orbital periods and the masses of the stars, we can use Kepler's third law to find a_planet.

Kepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = (M_star + M_planet) / (M_sun) ) * (1 / (4 * pi^2)) )

Wait, maybe better to write it in terms of the formula:

P^2 = (4 * pi^2 / G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a^3

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (since Earth-like), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So for each planet, a_planet is proportional to cube root of (P^2 * M_star)

Wait, more accurately, a^3 = (G(M_star) * P^2) / (4 pi^2 )

But since G and 4 pi^2 are constants, a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star )^(1/3)

So a_planet = k * (P^2 * M_star )^(1/3 )

Where k is a constant factor.

So for Planet_1, P1 is 1/3 of P2? Wait, no. The question says that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, no: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So Planet_1's period is P1 = (1/3) P2.

So for a_planet:

a1 = ( (P1^2 * M1 ) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( (P2^2 * M2 ) )^(1/3 )

We know that M1 = 2 M2. Because the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

So, let's set up variables.

Let me let M2 = M, so M1 = 2M.

P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1 = [ ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * (2M) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (P2^2 * M ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute a1 and a2.

Compute a1 = [ ( (P2^2 / 9) * 2M ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 M P2^2 ) / 9 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (M P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ (2/9) M P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (1 M P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, the ratio a1 / a2 = [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Hmm, 2/9 is about 0.2222. The cube root of that is approximately 0.6 (since 0.6^3 is 0.216). So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is, which is expected since its period is shorter.

Now, transit probability is P = R_star / a_planet.

Since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So P1 = R / a1

P2 = R / a2

We can compute the ratio P1/P2.

P1/P2 = (R/a1 ) / ( R/a2 ) = a2 / a1 = (a2) / (a1 )

Which is 1/(a1/a2) ) = 1/(0.6 ) ≈ 1.6667

So P1 is about 1.6667 times higher than P2.

Wait, so the probability for Planet_1 is higher than that of Planet_2 by approximately 1.67 times.

So the researchers should observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which is way higher. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Compute the ratio a1 / a2:

a1 = [ (P1^2 * M1 ) ]^(1/3 )

But P1 = P2 / 3, M1 = 2 M2.

So a1 = [ ( (P2^2 / 9 ) * 2 M2 ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ ( P2^2 * M2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ (2/9) * (P2^2 M2) ) ]^(1/3 ) = [2/9]^(1/3 ) * [P2^2 M2]^(1/3 )

a2 = [P2^2 M2]^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [2/9]^(1/3 ) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3 )

What's the cube of 0.6? 0.216. So 0.6^3=0.216. 0.63^3 is about 0.25, so [2/9]^(1/3) is approximately 0.6. So a1 is 0.6 * a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667 a1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The transit probability is P = R_star / a_planet.

So P1 = R / a1.

P2 = R / a2.

We need to find P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1 

Which is (a2 / a1) = ( [ (M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 ) ] ) / ( [ (2M2) (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3 ) ] )

Wait, perhaps using the expressions for a1 and a2:

a1 = ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * (2M2) )^(1/3 )

= [ ( P2^2/9 ) * 2 M2 ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = ( (P2^2 ) * M2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3 ) * ( ( P2^2 M2 )^(1/3 ) )

a2 = ( P2^2 M2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3 ) * a2.

Thus, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3 ) * a2.

Then, P1/P2 = (R / a1 ) / ( R / a2 ) ) = a2 / a1 = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3 )

What's (2/9)^(1/3 )? Let me compute it.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6 (since 0.6^3=0.216).

So 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So P1 is about 1.67 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options, option C says 1.65 times, which is close to 1.67. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me compute  (2/9) more accurately. 2/9 = 0.222222...

What's the cube root of that? Let me compute it.

The cube of 0.6 is 0.216.

The cube of 0.63 is 0.63^3 = 0.63 * 0.63 = 0.3969, then *0.63 = 0.250047.

Wait, that's 0.25. But 0.2222 is between 0.216 and 0.25.

So perhaps the cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.605.

So 1/0.605 ≈ 1.65, which matches option C's 1.65 times.

Hence, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting than Planet_2, so the researchers should observe Planet_1. The transit probability is about 1.65 times higher.

Wait, but wait: another factor I might have missed. The transit probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit, but since the RV method already detects the planet, which requires a high enough inclination (so that the RV method can see the Doppler shift), but for the transit probability, the RV method only tells us that the planet's orbit is aligned to some degree. However, in this question, the RV method has already detected the planet, which means that the orbit must have an inclination high enough to cause the Doppler shift. So the prior probability for the transit is conditional on the planet's existence, but perhaps the RV method gives a minimum mass, but for the transit probability, we're considering the probability given that the planet exists. No, wait, the transit probability is the geometric probability, which depends on the inclination. But the RV method is sensitive to planets with higher inclinations (closer to 90 degrees), so perhaps the prior for the transit is not the same as for planets discovered by other methods.

Wait, but the question says that both planets have been detected via RV, so their orbits are already known to have sufficient inclination to cause the RV signal. So the question is about the probability of a transit given that the planet exists and has an orbital inclination that allows RV detection.

So, for RV, the planet's orbit must have an inclination i where sin i ≈ (minimum mass) / (actual mass). Wait, no, the RV method gives the minimum mass because sin i can't be more than 1. But if a planet is detected via RV, it's because the RV signal is significant, which implies that sin i is large enough. So, the inclination i is such that sin i ≈ (minimum mass)/(actual mass). But since the actual mass is the same as the minimum mass (if the planet's orbit is edge-on, sin i =1), but actually, for RV, you only get m sin i. So for the purpose of transit probability, the RV detection implies that the inclination is high enough to produce a certain RV amplitude. But the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough that the planet passes in front of the star.

Wait, but the RV method is most sensitive to planets with i≈90 degrees (edge-on). So in reality, the probability is higher for planets detected via RV?

No, not exactly. Wait, the transit probability is (R_star/a_planet) * (1 + R_planet/R_star) ), but for a planet that already has an inclination i (from RV), the probability of transit is (R_star/a_planet) * (1 / (sin i)) )?

Wait, no. I think I'm mixing things up. The transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is P = (R_star + R_planet)/a_planet * (R_star + R_planet)/a_planet, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_star/a_planet) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2) ), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it's just R_star/a_planet.

But if the RV method has already constrained the inclination to be high enough, then the probability that the planet transits is higher. Wait, but I think that's a different scenario. Let's clarify.

In the general case, without any prior constraints, the transit probability is roughly (R_star/a_planet). But if a planet is detected via RV, it must have an inclination i where sin i > (m sin i)_detected. Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me think.

When a planet is detected via RV, the observed velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G (M_planet) sin i )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^( ) )) )

Wait, perhaps that's more detailed than needed. The key point is that for the RV method to detect a planet, sin i must be large enough. So the probability of transit is conditional on the planet's inclination, which is already known to be high (since RV has detected it). Wait, no, RV doesn't tell you the exact inclination, only that sin i is high enough for the RV signal to be detected. So the RV method can't determine i exactly, but it tells us that sin i ≥ (m sin i)_detected.

But for the purpose of transit probability, the prior is that i is constrained to be such that sin i ≥ some value. So the probability that the planet transits is conditional on i being in that range.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the geometric probability of transit given that the planet exists. The RV detection doesn't directly affect the transit probability; it just confirms the planet's existence. So for the transit probability, it's the same as if we have a randomly oriented orbit, but since RV requires a certain minimum inclination (so it can detect the planet), perhaps the prior on i is higher.

Wait, but the question says that the researchers are attempting to detect transits. They have already used RV to detect the planets, so the planets have orbital inclinations that are high enough to be detected via RV. So their inclinations are not random anymore; they are biased towards higher i. But for the transit probability, the RV method doesn't change the fact that the probability is based on the planet's orbital parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the RV method doesn't affect the transit probability, which is still (R_star/a_planet) * (R_planet is negligible). So the transit probability is only dependent on R_star and a_planet.

Wait, but another consideration is that the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but the actual mass could be higher (if sin i <1). But the question states that both planets have the same masses, so I think it's assuming that their masses are known and are the same. So sin i =1, meaning their orbits are edge-on. Wait, no, because if the RV method can only give m sin i, then unless sin i=1, the actual mass is higher. But the question says both have the same masses, so perhaps in this scenario, the masses are the same and sin i=1 (i=90 degrees), so their orbits are edge-on. But then the probability of a transit would be 100% if they are edge-on. But that can't be, because the question is about which has a higher probability, implying that it's not 100% certain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me go back to the original question.

The question says that both planets have the same masses, so their actual masses are same, and their host stars have same radius. So for transit probability, it's R_star / a_planet.

So, which planet has a smaller a_planet? Because a_planet is inversely proportional to transit probability (since P = R/a), smaller a_planet means higher P.

Earlier calculation shows that Planet_1 has a shorter period and higher mass host star. So using Kepler's law, the a_planet is smaller for Planet_1, leading to higher transit probability.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, as transit is more probable.

The options are:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

From earlier, the ratio P1/P2 was about 1.65, so option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}}
\]

where \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star and \(a_{\text{planet}}\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The semi-major axis can be derived from Kepler's third law:

\[
a_{\text{planet}} \propto \left(P^2 \cdot M_{\text{star}}\right)^{1/3}
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Planet masses**: Both planets have the same mass.
2. **Orbital periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2 (\(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\)).
3. **Host star masses**: The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).
4. **Host star radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2 = R\)).

### Step 1: Compute \(a_{\text{planet}}\) for each planet
Using Kepler's law:

\[
a_1 \propto \left(P_1^2 \cdot M_1\right)^{1/3}, \quad a_2 \propto \left(P_2^2 \cdot M_2\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):

\[
a_1 \propto \left(\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2M_2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2P_2^2}{9} \cdot M_2\right)^{1/3}
\]

\[
a_2 \propto \left(P_2^2 \cdot M_2\right)^{1/3}
\]

Taking the ratio:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{\frac{2P_2^2}{9} \cdot M_2}{P_2^2 \cdot M_2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Approximating \(\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6\), we find:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.6 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Compute transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}}
\]

Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2 = R\)):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6 \cdot a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its shorter orbital period and closer distance to its star, making it the preferred target for observation. The transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.
