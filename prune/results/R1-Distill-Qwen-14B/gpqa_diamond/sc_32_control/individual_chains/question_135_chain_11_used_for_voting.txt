Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Okay, the question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian describes the interactions. So the boson X is interacting with fermions here.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels for X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing various fermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy to meet the mass requirements. So each decay product must have a mass less than X's mass divided by 2 if it's a pair. Because the boson is at rest, each fermion must have enough mass to exist.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of the known fermions. Let's see:

- Electron (e): negligible, like 0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ): about 0.105 GeV.
- Tau (τ): around 1.777 GeV.
- Quarks: up (u), down (d) are light, maybe a few MeV each.
- Strange (s) is heavier, about 95 MeV (wait, is that right? Oh wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the masses: up and down are like ~2-5 MeV. Strange is around 100 MeV. Then, the heavier quarks are the charm (c) at about 1.5 GeV, bottom (b) around 4.5 GeV, and top (t) is way heavier, like 173 GeV.

Wait, so the mass of the X boson is 6 GeV. So when it decays, it can produce pairs of fermions, but each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 (since you have two particles) is 3 GeV.

Looking at the quarks: the bottom quark is ~4.5 GeV. Oh wait, but 4.5 is more than 3? So a pair of bottom quarks would require each to be at least 4.5 GeV, but 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar, right? Because that would require more mass. So any option that includes b bbar is not allowed.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the X boson mass? If X is 6 GeV, then the maximum mass for a single fermion it can decay into is 6 GeV (if it's a single fermion, but in this case, it's decaying into a pair, so each has to be less than 3 GeV). So b is 4.5 GeV, which is heavier than 3, so X can't produce b bbar.

But looking at the options: option A includes b bbar, but options B, C, D don't. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C: has c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, so according to my earlier thought, X can't decay into b bbar because each b is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So any option including b bbar is invalid. So options A and D are out because they include b.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the question is about the interaction term. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, this looks like a Yukawa coupling. So the interaction is between X and fermions f.

Wait, does this affect the possible decay channels? Because the Lagrangian indicates which fermions X can interact with. Because for a decay X→ff̄, the fermion f must be part of the interaction. So the possible decay products are limited to the fermions f present in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So X can only decay into fermions that are in that interaction term. But looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So f is the fermion type. Wait, but the way it's written is a bit confusing. The interaction term is proportional to X(y) ψ_f ψ̄_f. So this would imply that X couples to the fermion ψ_f.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to all fermions, but I'm not sure about the model here. So the interaction is for all fermions f. Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that X can interact with any fermion, but the decay is allowed only if the fermion's mass is less than m_X/2.

So the possible decay channels are any fermion pairs where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV. Let's list the fermion masses again.

Electron: 0.0005 GeV – way below 3 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.

Muon: 0.105 GeV – allowed.

Tau: 1.777 GeV – allowed.

Quarks:

u and d: very light, ~ a few MeV. So their pairs are allowed.

s quark: about 95 MeV? So yes, s sbar is allowed.

c quark: 1.5 GeV – allowed.

b quark: 4.5 GeV – not allowed, since 4.5 > 3 GeV.

t quark: 173 GeV – way too heavy.

So the possible fermion pairs allowed are:

e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-,

u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Wait, but what about the top quark? No, since m_t >3 GeV, so t tbar is not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

So looking back at the options:

Option B is X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So that's all the allowed ones.

Option C includes t tbar, which is not allowed, so C is out.

But wait, let's look at the options again.

Option B is correct. So the allowed decay channels are as in B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which implies that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) if the fermion mass is less than \( m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). The possible decay products are limited to fermions with masses below 3 GeV.

The masses of the known fermions are approximately:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \),
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

From this, the fermions with masses below 3 GeV are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the allowed decay channels are:

\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b = 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed. **Valid**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Invalid**.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it contains all the kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.
