Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The question is about what momentum a photon should have to cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So in that case, the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm not exactly sure whether that's the next vibrational state or just a different rotational state. Oh wait, the question specifies the "next state with the lowest possible energy." So I suppose it's the minimal energy jump, which would probably involve a vibrational transition, not a rotational one, because rotational transitions might require more energy or specific selection rules.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The quantum rotation-vibration model, sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model, accounts for both rotation and vibration. The energy levels here are quantized, and for a diatomic molecule, the energy depends on both the rotational quantum number (J) and the vibrational quantum number (n). 

In the fundamental state, the vibrational quantum number n is at its lowest, which is n=0, and the rotational quantum number J is also at its lowest, J=0. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would probably involve the molecule moving to the next vibrational state, n=1, but what about rotation? Because when you have a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels can also change, but I think the selection rules for vibrational transitions (like in the rigid rotor model) usually allow for J to change by ±1, but if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is J=0, then going to J=1 would be necessary. But wait, the problem is about the next state with the lowest energy, so perhaps it's either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, so I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy, so the next state could be either the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (n=0, J=1). Which one has a lower energy difference?

Let me compute both and see which one is smaller. Because the photon's energy has to match the energy difference required for the transition.

First, the vibrational energy levels. The energy for a vibration is given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 would require a photon with energy ΔE_vib = ħω.

For the rotational energy, the energy for a rigid rotor is E_rot = (J (J+1) ) ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the transition from J=0 to J=1 would have ΔE_rot = [ (1)(2) - (0)(1) ] * ħ²/(2I) = (2) ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller: ΔE_vib or ΔE_rot?

I need to calculate both.

Given the data:
Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms (which is 2e-10 meters)
Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, but for the rotational part, I need the moment of inertia I. For a diatomic molecule, I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me calculate that.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But I need to convert this to kg because the units for I will be in kg·m².

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016. So about 3.016e-27 kg.

Then, I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot.

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I). Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2. But wait, the units here: ħ² has units (J·s)^2, and I is kg·m². So when we compute ħ² / I, the units become (J·s)^2 / (kg·m²).

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s². So let me see: J = kg·m²/s². So J² is kg²·m^4/s^4. So (J^2 s²) is kg²·m^4/s². Divided by kg·m²: (kg² m^4 / s²) / (kg m²) ) = kg m² / s², which is J.

So good, ΔE_rot has units of Joules.

So compute ħ²/(I) = (1.112e-68) / (1.2064e-46) ≈ approximately (1e-68 / 1e-46) = 1e-22. But more accurately, 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 ≈ (1.112/1.2064) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.922 * 1e-22 = 9.22e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib = ħ ω.

Compute that: ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So comparing ΔE_rot ≈ 9.22e-23 J and ΔE_vib ≈ 4.218e-20 J, which is larger? 4.2e-20 is bigger than 9.2e-23. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 9.2e-23 is less than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition has a smaller energy difference.

So the molecule would preferentially make a rotational transition because it requires less energy.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So for the non-rigid rotor model, the fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next state would be either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0. Which one has a lower energy? Because perhaps the next state is the one with the smallest possible increase in energy.

So since ΔE_rot is smaller, the photon should provide that amount of energy. Because the question is asking for the photon's momentum, which is related to the energy via E = pc (since for photons, E = pc, because their mass is zero, so E=hf=pc).

Wait, but photons also have energy E = hf, and since f = c/λ, E = hc/λ. And the momentum p is E/c. So p = E/c.

Wait, for a photon, E = pc, so p = E/c. So the momentum is E divided by the speed of light, c.

So first, let's compute the energy required, and then get the momentum.

So the energy required is the ΔE_rot, which is 9.22e-23 J.

So p = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, that's 3e-31 kg·m/s, but the options are in the 1e-28 N·s range.

Wait, wait a second, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because the answer options are much larger than this.

Hmm, maybe I confused the energy levels. Because another thought: perhaps the next state with the lowest possible energy is the first vibrational state, even though it requires higher energy. Because sometimes, the energy levels can be ordered such that the next state is a vibrational transition.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy levels of the combined rotation and vibration model. The energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. For the fundamental state, n=0 and J=0.

The next state could have n=1 and J=0, or n=0 and J=1, or even n=1 and J=1. But the question says the "next state with the lowest possible energy". That would be the state with the next higher energy, which could be either the first vibrational level or the first rotational level, whichever is lower.

Wait, because in some cases, the rotational energy might be lower than the vibrational energy. So if ΔE_rot < ΔE_vib, then the photon's energy would match ΔE_rot, which is smaller, so the transition would be to J=1, n=0. But if ΔE_vib is smaller than ΔE_rot, then the transition would be to n=1, J=0.

Wait, earlier I calculated ΔE_rot as ~9e-23 J, and ΔE_vib as ~4e-20 J. So ΔE_rot is smaller. So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy 9e-23 J, moving to J=1, n=0.

Wait, but the options don't have any numbers that small. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait a second, Ns is Newton-seconds, which is kg·m/s. So if the momentum p is in Ns, then it's the same as kg·m/s.

Earlier, I got p = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s (which is 3.07e-31 Ns). But none of the options are that small. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in computing the moment of inertia. Let's go through that again.

Mass X = 20 amu; Mass Y = 2 amu.

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ Let's compute that: 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988. So 2.988e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. 20/11 is approximately 1.81818.

So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889, 0.01818 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.02999. So total approximately 3.0189e-27 kg.

Wait, earlier I thought 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 was about 3.016e-27. Yes, that's correct.

Then I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

I = 3.0189e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.20756e-46 kg·m².

Then, E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ² ) / (2I).

From J=0 to J=1:

ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = [ (2) * ħ²/(2I) ] - [0] = ħ²/(I).

So yes, that's correct.

So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So E_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.20756e-46) ≈ 9.208e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, in the rotational energy, the formula is E_rot = [J (J+1) ] * ħ² / (2I) ).

Ah! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because the rotational energy for J=1 is 2 * ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I) as before, so the delta E is ħ²/(I). But earlier, I computed that as 9.2e-23 J.

But when I compute ΔE_rot as 9.2e-23 J, which is about 9.2e-23 J. Then, the momentum of the photon is p = E/c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that small. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming the transition is rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is from the vibrational transition, which is much bigger, but the options are in the 1e-28 Ns range.

Wait, let's compute p for the vibrational case.

ΔE_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = E/c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = approximately 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this.

Wait, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. So that's close to our calculation.

But wait, earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, so it would be more probable. But why is the momentum calculated for the vibrational transition matching one of the options?

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state, which might involve both a vibrational and a rotational change. Or perhaps, it's the next state in the combined model, which is the next in energy, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy levels more accurately.

The total energy for each state is E = E_vib + E_rot.

For the fundamental state (n=0, J=0):

E_0,0 = (0 + 1/2) ħω + (0*(0+1)) ħ²/(2I) ) = (1/2) ħω + 0.

For the next state with the lowest energy, it could be either:

1. n=1, J=0: E_1,0 = (1 + 1/2) ħω + 0 = (3/2) ħω.

Energy difference: (3/2 ħω) - (1/2 ħω) ) = ħω.

2. n=0, J=1: E_0,1 = (1/2) ħω + [1*2 * ħ²/(2I) ) ] = (1/2) ħω + (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = (1/2) ħω + ħ²/I.

The energy difference for this transition would be [(1/2 ħω) + (ħ²/I)] - (1/2 ħω ) )= ħ²/I.

Which is smaller, ħω or ħ²/I?

So let's compute both.

We have:

ħω = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

ħ²/I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.20756e-46 kg·m²) ) 

Let me compute that:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

1.112e-68 / 1.20756e-46 = 9.208e-23 J.

So 9.2e-23 J is much less than 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the molecule would preferentially make that transition.

But the photon's energy would have to match the energy difference of the rotational transition, which is 9.2e-23 J. 

Then, p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are anywhere near that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me recalculate μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Yes, that's correct. So in kg, it's 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

Calculating that:

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

Let me compute:

1.81818 * 1.6605:

= 1.8 * 1.6605 + 0.01818 *1.6605.

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ 0.02999.

So total ≈ 3.0189 kg contribution. So 3.0189e-27 kg.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating I.

I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0189e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.20756e-46 kg·m². Correct.

So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.112e-68) / (1.20756e-46) ≈ 9.208e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm supposed to consider the transition to the next state as a vibrational transition, but why would that be the case? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, but maybe the selection rules only allow for certain transitions.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ = ±1. But for the vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δn = ±1, regardless of J. However, when both changes happen together, like Δn=±1 and ΔJ=±1, that's when you have a vibrational transition with rotational changes. But for the minimum energy transition, perhaps the rotational is lower.

But the problem states it's a non-rigid rotor model. Wait, non-rigid rotor typically includes vibration as well, so the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational.

Wait, but maybe the question is simplifying and only considering the vibrational transition, assuming that the rotational transitions are not possible for some reason.

But the options suggest that the correct answer is around 1e-28 Ns, which would correspond to a photon with energy around 3e-20 J (since p = E/c, and 1e-28 Ns is (1e-28 kg m/s) * (3e8 m/s) = 3e-20 J). 

Wait, wait. Let me compute that. If p = 1.4e-28 Ns, then E = p*c = 1.4e-28 kg·m/s * 3e8 m/s = 4.2e-20 J. Which matches the vibrational energy.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, and ignore the rotational one. But why would that be the case?

Hmm, maybe because the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy", which might refer to the first excited state of the system, which is the first state after the fundamental. But in that case, perhaps the first excited state is the first vibrational level, not the rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the model here only considers vibrational transitions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (n=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could be either J=1, n=0 or n=1, J=0. Whichever requires less energy.

Earlier, I found that the rotational transition requires less energy, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in thinking about which transition is allowed.

Wait, perhaps the selection rules for electric dipole transitions require that the vibrational transition (Δn=±1) and rotational transition (ΔJ=±1) happen together. So in reality, the molecule can't make a pure rotational transition without a vibrational one. So the minimal transition is a combination of both.

But that would complicate things, perhaps making the energy difference larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, as the rotational transitions are negligible or perhaps not allowed. That would explain why the photon's energy is ħw, which is 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier, I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon have to provide the higher energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length R is given, and the question is actually about the vibrational transition, so the energy is ħω, leading to the required photon momentum.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because the problem mentions the 'non-rigid rotor model', which is another name for the rotation-vibration model where the bond length isn't fixed (unlike the rigid rotor). So perhaps in this model, the transition is a combination of rotation and vibration, so the photon's energy must account for both.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational part, and the rotational part is ignored because it's a 'fundamental state' which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state.

Wait, the question says, "the molecule is in its fundamental state". The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is n=0, J=0. The next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. So the question is, which transition requires less energy.

As calculated earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy. But then why are the options so much larger? Because 9.2e-23 J is much less than 4.2e-20 J. So the momentum would be 3e-31 Ns, but the options are in the 1e-28 range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia correctly. Let me compute I again.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ is (20 amu *2 amu)/(22 amu) =40/22=20/11 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

20/11 ≈1.81818.

1.81818 *1.6605e-27 = Let me compute that exactly.

1.81818 *1.6605 = 

1.81818 *1.6 = 2.909088

1.81818 *0.0605 = approximately 0.11009.

Total: 2.909088 + 0.11009 ≈3.01918.

So μ =3.01918e-27 kg.

Then, I= μ R² = 3.01918e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² =1.20767e-46 kg·m².

So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.20767e-46.

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2= 1.112e-68.

Divide by denominator: 1.112e-68 / 1.20767e-46 ≈9.208e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the rotational part, but only the vibrational part. Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, but the rotational transition would give a lower energy photon. However, the options don't include that, but option D gives a p of 1.4e-28 Ns, which corresponds to 4.2e-20 J, which is the energy for the vibrational transition. 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the photon's momentum.

Wait, E = hf = pc, so p = E/(c).

So for E =4.2e-20 J, c=3e8 m/s.

p =4.2e-20 /3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg·m/s =1.4e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D.

But why would the molecule have to absorb a photon of higher energy when a lower-energy transition is possible? Unless the selection rules don't allow the rotational transition. For example, maybe the rotational transition requires a change in J, which is allowed only when ΔJ=±1, but perhaps in combination with Δn=±1. So maybe the minimal transition is a vibrational one, which includes both a change in n and J. But that's getting complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation, which would make the answer option D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Because the question says the model is the 'non-rigid rotor model', which I think includes both rotation and vibration. So that's a bit confusing.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the 'fundamental state' as the state with the minimal vibrational energy, irrespective of rotation. So the next state would be the first vibrational state, regardless of rotation. That would ignore the possibility of a rotational transition.

But that doesn't make sense because the model includes rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to consider the vibrational part, so the answer is D. Because the options don't match the rotational transition, perhaps the intended solution is to compute the vibrational photon momentum.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Given that, I think perhaps the intended answer is D, 1.4e-28 Ns, as that corresponds to the vibrational transition. But I'm not entirely sure why the rotational transition isn't considered.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the fundamental state and the next possible states. The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, where the vibrational quantum number \( n = 0 \) and the rotational quantum number \( J = 0 \). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\( n = 1, J = 0 \)) or a rotational transition (\( n = 0, J = 1 \)).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy Difference**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) \hbar \omega \).  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy Difference**:  
   The rotational energy levels for a diatomic molecule are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J (J+1) \hbar^2}{2I} \), where \( I \) is the moment of inertia.  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2
   \]  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu})(2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]  
   Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):  
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.019 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.208 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}

3. **Comparison of Energy Differences**:  
   The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.208 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The rotational transition requires significantly less energy. However, the problem's options suggest that the vibrational transition is being considered, as the momentum corresponding to \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \) matches one of the options.

4. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This matches option D.

### Conclusion:
While the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem's options suggest that the vibrational transition is being considered. The photon's momentum for the vibrational transition is \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), which corresponds to option D.
