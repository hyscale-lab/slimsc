Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit of a puzzle, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and we're supposed to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let me start by identifying each component. Let's go piece by piece.

First, the reaction between X and Y. X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, what gas fits that?

Well, if a molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, perhaps it's something like H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (protons 1 each) and O (8 protons). Wait, but that's not same. Alternatively, maybe a molecule like CO2? Wait, no, each CO2 molecule has 1 C (12 protons) and 2 O (8 each). Not matching.

Wait, wait. If the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, if the molecule is something like CH4, let's see. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), and each H has 1. So each CH4 would have (6+6) in C, and 4 H's, which is 4. So total protons: 6 +4=10, neutrons:6. Not same. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NH3. Let's see: N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (14N), H has 1. So each NH3 molecule has 7 protons (N) + 3 H (3 protons) = 10 protons. Neutrons: 7 (from N) + 0 from H = 7. So 10 protons and 7 neutrons. Not same.

Wait another angle: maybe the gas is something like O2 or O3. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons (each O has 8) and 16 neutrons (each O has 8). So each molecule of O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. Because 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So W could be O2.

Alternatively, could it be H2? H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. No, that doesn't fit. How about He? He is a noble gas, but He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So a He atom would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So each He molecule (He is monoatomic) would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So yes, same number. But He is a gas, so it could be He.

Wait, but the reaction between X and Y releases gas W, which is He? That's possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe H2O? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, maybe the molecule is C. No, because C is solid. Or maybe O2 as I thought before. Or perhaps another gas.

Wait, another thought: what about when a metal reacts with water? For example, sodium reacts with water to produce H2 gas. But sodium plus water gives H2, which has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO2. Wait, CO2 has protons: C (6) + 2 O (8 each) = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (if 12C), O has 8 each. So 6 + 16 = 22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Each CO2 molecule would have that. So that would fit.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, yes. So maybe that's W.

Wait, but another approach: let me think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is around 4°C. So what substance has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe something like water ice? No, water's melting point is 273 K, which is 0°C. Wait, 277 is 4°C. Hmm. Wait, wait. 273 K is 0°C, so 277 K is about 4°C. So B's melting point is about 4°C. What's that? Maybe ammonium nitrate? No, because its melting point is higher. Or maybe paraffin? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like iodine, but iodine's melting point is higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is some kind of salt. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is sodium nitrate. No, sodium nitrate's melting point is much higher. Alternatively, maybe B is some kind of hydrated salt that melts at around 4°C. Or perhaps it's a solid that's a byproduct of the reaction.

Wait, but let's step back. The reaction between X and Y produces G, a precipitate, which when heated yields B. B's melting point is around 277 K. So perhaps B is something like a metal oxide. For example, if X is a base and Y is an acid, then G would be a precipitate of a metal hydroxide, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal reacting with a liquid (like water) to form a hydroxide, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, the problem also says that when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, which when heated decomposes to a metal oxide and CO2 gas. Wait, but that would mean Y could be an acid. Alternatively, maybe G is a sulfate or something else.

Another angle: Let's think about the product of X with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like acetoacetic acid, which is a β-keto acid. When such an acid reacts with a base or something like that, maybe it undergoes a reaction like decarboxylation. For example, in the presence of a strong base, a keto acid might lose CO2, but here the product has two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH, which would deprotonate the keto acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says the product contains two atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is something like acetate (CH3COO-), which has two oxygen atoms. But then X would be something like a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming an acetate. Alternatively, if the keto acid reacts with X, which is a strong base, then perhaps it forms a salt. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a molecule like CH3COOH (which has two O in the -COOH group?), no, wait: acetic acid has two oxygen atoms in the group, so maybe that's the product. Wait, but the product is the result of reacting with X. So perhaps X is a base or a reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: the problem mentions that substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH (sodium hydroxide), KOH (potassium hydroxide), or something like that. Also, X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's a sodium isotope, like 25Mg? No, wait. Wait, sodium's common isotope is 23Na. The heavier one would be 25Na? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, let me consider the reaction of X with Y. If X is a metal, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce a salt, H2 gas, maybe. But earlier we thought that the gas W could be O2, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, leading to CO2 gas.

Wait, but the melting point of B is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe B is a sodium salt, like NaHCO3. Wait, sodium bicarbonate's melting point is around 270 K, which is about -1°C. But the problem states 277 K, which is 4°C. Hmm, close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, maybe B is ice. But ice's melting point is 273 K (0°C). Hmm, 277 K is 4°C, which would be just above that. So perhaps B is a solid that's a byproduct of the reaction, like sodium nitrate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, stepping back, perhaps I should consider the reaction:

X (solid) + Y (liquid) → gas W + precipitate G

When G is heated, it gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So perhaps the reaction of X and Y is a double displacement reaction.

Suppose Y is water (liquid). If X is a metal, maybe sodium. Sodium reacts violently with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But the gas released in that reaction is H2. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Oh, that doesn't fit the W condition (same number of protons and neutrons).

Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate. Suppose X is sodium carbonate. Then Y could be an acid, like sulfuric acid. The reaction would produce CO2 gas. CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol, and each molecule has 12 protons (6 from C, 6 from O each? Wait, no, C is 6 protons, each O is 8. So CO2 has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Each O has 8 neutrons (assuming 16O), so CO2 would have 6 (from C, if 12C) + 8*2 (from O) = 22 neutrons. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits W's condition. So W is CO2.

So if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), Y is sulfuric acid (H2SO4), then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

The precipitate G in this case might not form, because all products are soluble. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another acid that would produce a precipitate. Like if X is a metal carbonate and Y is a less soluble acid. For example, if Y is HCl, and X is Ag2CO3 (though silver carbonate is not very stable). Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For example, if G is Na2CO3·10H2O, heating it would lose water and CO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where X is sodium (Na). Sodium reacts violently with water (Y) to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But the H2 gas doesn't fit W's condition. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an isotope of sodium, like 25Na, which is heavier. Wait, 25Na is not a common isotope. The natural abundance is like 10% for 25Na. So perhaps X is a compound where one element is a heavier isotope.

Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X is something like NaCl, where Na is 25Na instead of 23Na. Or maybe X is something else entirely.

Wait, going back to the product of the keto acid and X. The product has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, making a carboxylate ion, which would have two O atoms in the COO- group. For example, if X is NaOH, the reaction would deprotonate a β-keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) to form the sodium salt, which has two O atoms in the COO- group.

So X could be NaOH. Then Y would be something that reacts with NaOH to produce gas W. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base. If Y is an acid, like H2SO4, the reaction would produce water and Na2SO4. But that's a neutralization reaction, no violent reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe Y is a salt that reacts with NaOH to produce a gas. For example, if Y is ammonium sulfate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid chloride, but that's not a liquid necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid such as water, and X is a solid like sodium oxide (Na2O). But that doesn't seem to fit the other clues.

Wait, another angle: X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound where one of its elements is the heavier isotope. For example, suppose X is NaOH, where Na is 25Na instead of 23Na.

In that case, the reaction of NaOH with a keto acid would deprotonate it, giving a sodium salt with two O atoms in the carboxylate group.

Now, back to the initial reaction: X (NaOH) reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce gas W, precipitate G, and upon heating G gives B with melting point ~4°C.

Wait, but NaOH is a base. If Y is a liquid acid, like sulfuric acid (H2SO4), then the reaction would be neutralization, producing Na2SO4, water, and no gas. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a chloride, like concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction of NaOH with HCl would produce NaCl, water, no gas. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution containing a carbonate. Then X (NaOH) would react with Y to produce a sodium salt and water. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Then the reaction would produce CO2 gas.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), Y is sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

So W is CO2, which fits because each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. The precipitate G in this case would be... wait, but all the products are soluble. So perhaps Y is a different acid, like HCl, but Na2CO3 + HCl would produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. Again, no precipitate.

Hmm. So maybe X is not Na2CO3. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid that reacts with X to form a precipitate. Maybe Y is a salt solution where the cation forms an insoluble hydroxide with X.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and Y is a copper sulfate solution. Then the reaction would produce a precipitate of copper hydroxide. Then, when heated, copper hydroxide decomposes into copper oxide and water. Wait, but the melting point of copper oxide is much higher than 4°C. So that might not fit.

Wait, but the product after heating G (the precipitate) gives B, which has a melting point near 4°C. So perhaps B is sodium bicarbonate? No, because sodium bicarbonate decomposes upon heating. Wait, when G is heated, perhaps it loses some water or CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate hydroxide, like sodium carbonate decahydrate. Heating it would lose water and CO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate that upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For example, if G is sodium carbonate, heating it doesn't decompose. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the precipitate G is something like sodium sulfide? No, that's soluble in water. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a nitrate. For example, if X is sodium hydroxide, and Y is a solution of Cu(NO3)2, the reaction would produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate. Heating that would give CuO, which has a high melting point. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, like AgNO3. X is NaOH. Reaction would give AgOH or AgO precipitate, which upon heating would give AgO or Ag2O. But that doesn't fit with B's melting point.

Wait, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about the product of X and a keto acid. The product has two O atoms. If the product is the salt of the keto acid, then perhaps it's a sodium salt, like sodium acetoacetate. The formula would be NaCH2C(O)COO^- Na^+. Wait, no, acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. When it reacts with NaOH, it would lose a proton to form CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+.

Wait, that product has two O atoms in the COO^- group. So yes, that fits the description: the product has two O atoms.

So X is NaOH, which is used as a reagent in organic chemistry (like in saponification or in the formation of esters). X incorporates a heavier isotope; perhaps the sodium is 25Na instead of 23Na.

Now, the initial reaction: X (NaOH, 25NaOH?) reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W, precipitate G, and upon heating G gives B with a melting point of ~277 K (4°C).

Wait, but NaOH is a strong base. If Y is an acid, the reaction would produce water and a salt. But if Y is a carbonate, like if Y is carbonated water, maybe? Or perhaps Y is a different liquid.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with NaOH to produce a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of a nitrate of a metal that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate.

Wait, let me think: if Y is a solution of Al(NO3)3, and X is NaOH, then the reaction would produce Al(OH)3 precipitate. But Al(OH)3 doesn't release any gas. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution that contains a cation which forms a gaseous product with X. For example, if Y is a solution of ammonium nitrate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution that when reacts with X (NaOH) produces a gas. Like if Y is a solution of NaNO2. Hmm, no.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of X (NaOH) with Y (maybe a metal) produces gas. But NaOH is a base; it's not typically used to react with metals to produce gas unless it's a very reactive metal.

Wait, perhaps Y is a hydrocarbon, but that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe Y is a liquid like an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, which when reacts with NaOH would produce no gas, but perhaps something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the gas W. It's a molecule with same number of protons and neutrons. Earlier, I thought CO2 fits because each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is CO2. So the reaction between X and Y must produce CO2 gas.

So, if W is CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4.

The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, the precipitate G would be... but Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate would form. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a weak acid, like acetic acid. Then the reaction would produce CO2 and acetate ions. But again, no precipitate.

Hmm, maybe X is not a carbonate but something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal that reacts with an acid Y to produce H2 gas, but earlier that didn't fit the W condition. Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate. Then Y is an acid, which would produce CO2. But bicarbonate plus acid gives CO2 and water, and perhaps a salt. Again, no precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfite, and X is an acid. The reaction would produce SO2 gas. Wait, but SO2 has 16 (S) + 16*2 (O) = 48 g/mol. Each SO2 molecule has 16 protons (S has 16, O has 8 each, so 16 + 8*2 = 24? Wait, no, S has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (32S), and O has 8 each. So each SO2 molecule would have 16 (S protons) + 2*8 (O protons) = 32 protons. Neutrons would be 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) = 32. So same number of protons and neutrons. So W could be SO2.

So if W is SO2, the reaction could involve X being a metal sulfite reacting with an acid Y to produce SO2 gas.

But then what's X? Let's say X is Na2SO3, a sodium sulfite. Y could be H2SO4. The reaction would be:

Na2SO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + SO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. So no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate and Y is a sulfuric acid, but I'm stuck.

Wait, let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point around 4°C. What solid has a melting point near 4°C? Hmm, maybe a hydrate, like Na2SO4·10H2O. Wait, but sodium sulfate decahydrate has a melting point that's not relevant. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride, but its melting point is higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is sodium nitrate, which has a melting point of around 327°C, which is way higher. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is a solid like iodine, but iodine's melting point is higher than that.

Wait, perhaps B is a carbonate, but that doesn't make sense because when heated, carbonates usually decompose.

Alternatively, maybe B is a bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point of around 270 K (-1°C), which is close to 277 K (4°C). So when G is heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So if G is NaHCO3, then when heated, it would give Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But then what is G?

Wait, but that would mean that G is NaHCO3. So how does G form in the reaction between X and Y?

If X is Na2CO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. No precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of X and Y produces G as a precipitate, which upon heating gives B as NaHCO3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate that is formed from a carbonate and an acid. But I'm not making much progress.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X must have at least two different elements. Let's think: X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Maybe it's NaOH (sodium hydroxide). So the elements are Na and O and H.

Wait, but Na and O are the main elements. So the lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1) and the heaviest is Na (23). But wait, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps the Na in X is 25Na instead of 23Na. So in that case, the heaviest element is still Na with atomic mass 25, and the lightest is H with 1. So cumulative atomic masses would be 25 (Na) + 1 (H) = 26? But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let's think of another reagent. Maybe X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate). So elements are Na, C, O. Lightest is C (12), but wait, carbon is heavier than H. Wait, no, the lightest element is H, but X doesn't have H. So in Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. So the lightest element is C (12) and the heaviest is O (16). But no, O has 16, same as C is 12. So the cumulative would be 12 + 16 = 28, which is not an option.

Wait, but X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Suppose X is NH3. But NH3 is a gas, and in the reaction it would release H2? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal with a heavier isotope. Let's say X is magnesium (Mg) with a heavier isotope, like Mg-25 or Mg-26. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound like CH3COONa (sodium acetate). The elements are C, H, O, Na. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something with heavier isotopes, like Cl. For example, if X is NaCl, where Cl is the heavier isotope (like 35Cl instead of 37Cl? No, 35Cl is lighter. Wait, heavier would be 37Cl. So in X, if Cl is 37Cl, then the element with heavier isotope is Cl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps one atom in X has a heavier isotope. For example, in X, one element is the heavier isotope. So when calculating the cumulative atomic masses, all instances of that element are considered as the heavier isotope.

Wait, but the question says to sum the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes for each element. So for each element in X, we sum all their isotopes present.

Wait, but if X has two elements, say Na and O, and Na is 25Na (heavier isotope), then the cumulative masses would be the sum of all Na atoms (each 25) and all O atoms (each 16). Or perhaps the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X.

Wait, the question says: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So, for example, if X contains elements A and B, where A is lighter than B, then we take the atomic mass of A and the atomic mass of B and sum them.

So, for X being NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that's a liquid, and it's not typically a reagent for reactions in the way described.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like sodium chloride (NaCl), but how would that fit the reaction?

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium. Sodium reacts with water (Y) to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But earlier, we saw that H2 doesn't fit the condition for W. But wait, earlier I thought W could be CO2 or SO2, but perhaps another gas.

Wait, but then when X is sodium, and Y is water, the reaction is:

2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑.

So W is H2, which doesn't fit the W condition (same protons and neutrons). So that can't be right.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to think of another angle. The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a base, and the product is a carboxylate. So X is NaOH, which would deprotonate the keto acid, forming a carboxylate with two O atoms.

So considering X is NaOH, the reaction with Y is something else. Maybe Y is a carbonate. For example, Y is a carbonate solution, and X is NaOH. But that's not likely to produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is NaOH, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. For example, if Y is Na2S and X is NaOH, but that's the same compound.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a metal that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of copper nitrate, and X is NaOH, the reaction would produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate. Then, when heated, Cu(OH)2 would decompose into CuO and water. But CuO has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit B's melting point.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a lead nitrate. Then, X (NaOH) would produce Pb(OH)2 precipitate, which upon heating decomposes into PbO and water. Again, not matching with B's melting point.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something like a hydroxide that, when heated, loses water to form a metal oxide. But again, the melting point of the metal oxide would be much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate hydroxide, which upon heating loses CO2 and H2O, leaving a metal oxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a substance that's solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C. For example, maybe B is a type of ice or a hydrated salt. Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate, like sodium carbonate decahydrate. But the melting point of that is higher than 4°C.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid like paraffin wax, which has a low melting point. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like camphor, which has a melting point around 176°C, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the elements in X. If X is NaOH, then elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So perhaps the sum is 25. Let's see: 25 could be from Na (23) and O (16?), but that's 39. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the heaviest element is Cl (35), and the lightest is O (16), but that's 51. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is NH3. Then the elements are N and H. N has 14, H has 1. Sum is 15, which isn't an option. Or maybe Cl is involved.

Wait, another approach: the question states that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope. Perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterated water), where D is 2H (deuterium). But D2O is a heavy water isotope. But D2O is a liquid, not a solid. Hmm, but X is a substance that reacts. So perhaps X is D2O, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CDCl3 (chloroform, but with a heavier isotope). But that's not a reagent for the type of reaction described.

Wait, perhaps X is something like Mg(OH)2, a strong base. Mg(OH)2 reacts with acids to produce Mg salts and water. For example, with H2SO4, it would produce MgSO4, water, and perhaps no gas. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think about the reaction again. X reacts with Y to produce gas W with same protons and neutrons, precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with melting point ~4°C.

If W is CO2, and B is something like NaHCO3, then perhaps the reaction is:

X (Na2CO3) + Y (H2SO4) → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

But as before, no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a different compound, like NaCl. If Y is a solution of AgNO3, then the reaction would produce AgCl precipitate. But that doesn't produce any gas, so W wouldn't be present. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is an acid. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas, and a salt. But then the precipitate would be the salt, which needs to be soluble or not.

Wait, perhaps X is sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which is a liquid. Then Y could be a carbonate, but that's not making much sense.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a carbonyl compound, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps X is something like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like sodium hydride (NaH), which is a strong base. Reacting NaH with a keto acid would deprotonate it, forming a carbanion. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible answers. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. These are all sums of two atomic masses. Let's see:

- 35 could be 16 (O) + 19 (F), but why F? Not sure.
- 25 could be 14 (N) + 11 (Na), but that's 25.
- 31 could be 12 (C) + 19 (F), but not sure.
- 29 could be 12 (C) + 17 (Cl), which is 29.

Wait, 14 (N) + 11 (Na) is 25. So if X contains N and Na, perhaps. So what compound contains both Na and N?

Like NaNH2 (sodium amide), which is a strong base. Sodium amide is used in organic chemistry as a base. So perhaps X is NaNH2.

Then, the elements in X would be Na and N. So the lightest element is N (14) and the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 14 + 23 = 37, which isn't an option.

Wait, but perhaps the elements are Na (23) and H (1), but that doesn't add up to any of the options.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). Then the elements are N, H, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing Cl and another element. For example, if X is NaCl, then elements are Na (23) and Cl (35). Sum is 58, which isn't an option.

Wait, but the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So perhaps the heaviest element in X is Cl (35), and the lightest is something like O (16), but 35 + 16 = 51, which isn't an option. Or perhaps the lightest is O (16) and the heaviest is Cl (35), sum 51.

Wait, another approach: the sum is 25. So 25 could be 14 (N) + 11 (Na). So X contains Na and N. So perhaps X is sodium azide NaN3? Sodium azide is a compound, but I'm not sure if it reacts violently with a liquid to produce CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaNO2 (sodium nitrite). Reacting with something to produce a gas. Let's see: NaNO2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + NO↑ + H2O. But NO doesn't fit the W condition. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps X is NH4Cl (ammonium chloride). If Y is NaOH, the reaction would produce NH3 gas, NaCl, and water. NH3 has 14 (N) + 3(1) =17 protons, and 14 (N) + 3(0) =14 neutrons. Not same.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CaCO3. Reacting with HCl would produce CO2 gas. CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. Then the precipitate would be CaCl2, which is soluble. So no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, and X is an acid. Then CO2 is produced as gas W. But no precipitate unless the acid is in excess and a different salt forms.

Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate, Y is a strong acid, producing CO2. If X is CaCO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction would produce CaSO4 (insoluble?), which would precipitate. But wait, CaSO4 is sparingly soluble. So perhaps precipitate G is CaSO4. Heating CaSO4 wouldn't release a gas, but would it release B with a melting point near 4°C? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is CaCO3, but that doesn't make sense because X is CaCO3.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I'll try to proceed.

Given that the options are 35, 25, 31, 29, and considering that X is a reagent in organic chemistry, perhaps X is something like NaOH. But the sum of elements doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: what if X is a compound containing both Na and O, with Na being the heavier isotope. So the elements are Na and O. So lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 39, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing Cl and O. For example, ClO2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is something like KClO3 (potassium chlorate), which is used as an oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is HCl (hydrochloric acid). But that's a liquid, and the reaction might not produce a precipitate.

Wait, going back, perhaps the precipitate G is sodium chloride, and when heated, it remains as sodium chloride (NaCl), which has a high melting point. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another approach: Maybe the precipitate G is something like NaHSO4·2H2O, which upon heating loses water to form Na2SO4, but that's not matching B's melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfate that upon heating loses water, like MgSO4·7H2O, which when heated becomes anhydrous MgSO4. But that's not matching B's melting point.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that G is a sulfhydrate or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reaction where X is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) reacting with sulfuric acid (H2SO4):

Na2SO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + SO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, the gas W is SO2, which fits the condition (32 protons and 32 neutrons per molecule). The precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is something else. Wait, perhaps X is NaNO3, and Y is HCl. But that reaction doesn't produce a precipitate.

Hmm. This is getting quite complicated. Let me try to sum up what I know:

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, likely a base or a salt.
- X incorporates a heavier isotope, so one of its elements is a heavier isotope.
- X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (same protons and neutrons), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with a melting point near 4°C.
- The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms.

Given that, perhaps X is NaOH, which is a strong base used in organic chemistry. The product with a keto acid would be a carboxylate with two O atoms.

Then, the reaction of NaOH with Y (maybe a carbonate solution) would produce CO2 gas (W), but then we need a precipitate G. If Y is a carbonate solution, perhaps the reaction is:

2 NaOH + CO3^2- → Na2CO3 + H2O.

But that's just a neutralization, no precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and X is NaOH. Then, the reaction would produce the metal hydroxide precipitate. For example, Y is MgCO3 solution.

Reaction: MgCO3 + 2 NaOH → Mg(OH)2 ↓ + Na2CO3.

In this case, W would be nothing, but perhaps some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is NaOH. Then, the reaction would produce a precipitate of a metal hydroxide. For example, Y is Cu(NO3)2 solution. Reaction: Cu(NO3)2 + 2 NaOH → Cu(OH)2 ↓ + 2 NaNO3.

So in this case, W is nothing, but perhaps if Y is something else, gas is produced.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a sulfide, and X is NaOH. Then, the reaction would produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons and 2*0 neutrons, which doesn't fit W's condition.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a bicarbonate, and X is NaOH. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas.

So, Y is NaHCO3 solution. X is NaOH.

But reaction: 2 NaHCO3 + 2 NaOH → 2 Na2CO3 + 2 H2O + CO2↑.

So gas W is CO2, which fits. Precipitate G would be Na2CO3, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a different bicarbonate. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that B is sodium nitrate. Wait, earlier I thought it has a high melting point, but maybe I'm mistaken.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a compound like KNO3, which has a high melting point.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let me think about the melting point again. 277 K is about 4°C. So B is a solid that's just above freezing at 4°C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a hydrate, like camphor, which has a melting point around 176°C. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of ice, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal oxide. For example, sodium oxide (Na2O) has a melting point around 1380°C. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like paraffin, but I'm not sure.

Well, perhaps I should move on and make an educated guess. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Given that X is NaOH, which has Na (23) and O (16). Wait, but the sum is 39, not an option.

Alternatively, if X is Na2CO3, elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). So lightest is C (12), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the elements in X are chlorine (35) and hydrogen (1). Sum is 36, which isn't an option. Alternatively, Cl (35) and O (16) sum to 51.

Wait, perhaps the elements are Cl (35) and Na (23). Sum is 58, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule like Cl2. Then, the elements are Cl. But that's a single element, so can't have lightest and heaviest.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a compound with two different isotopes, like Cl and another element.

Wait, perhaps X is CaCl2, which is calcium chloride. Then elements are Ca (40) and Cl (35). So lightest element is Cl (35), heaviest is Ca (40). Sum is 75, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the elements are Cl (35) and O (16). Sum is 51, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 25. That would be 14 (N) + 11 (Na) = 25. So if X contains Na and N, perhaps X is NaNH2 (sodium amide). Sodium amide is a strong base used in organic chemistry. So that fits.

Then, the elements in X are Na and N. So lightest is N (14), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 14 +23=37, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH4Cl (ammonium chloride). Elements are N (14), H (1), Cl (35). So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35). Sum is 36, not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 25. So what elements add up to 25? 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25. But why would X contain Al and C?

Alternatively, 16 (O) +9 (F) =25. So perhaps X contains O and F. So X could be something like NaF (sodium fluoride) and O? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaF, which is sodium fluoride. So elements are Na (23) and F (19). Sum is 42, which isn't an option.

Wait, another angle: perhaps X is something like Mg(OH)2. So elements are Mg (24.3), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Mg (24.3). Sum is 25.3, which is close to 25. So option B is 25.

But wait, does X being Mg(OH)2 fit the other conditions? Let's see.

Mg(OH)2 is a strong base. If Y is an acid, like H2SO4, the reaction would produce MgSO4, water, and perhaps release gas. But Mg(OH)2 + H2SO4 → MgSO4 + 2 H2O. No gas produced, so W wouldn't be present. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps X is MgCO3. Reacting with HCl would produce CO2 gas. So W is CO2.

So, X is MgCO3. Then Y is HCl. Reaction: MgCO3 + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, W is CO2, which fits. The precipitate G would be MgCl2, which is soluble. So no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is MgCO3. Reaction: MgCO3 + 2 AgNO3 → Mg(NO3)2 + 2 AgCO3 ↓. But AgCO3 is not stable, it decomposes.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is Mg(OH)2, which forms when X reacts with a solution containing OH- ions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if X is MgCO3, the elements are Mg (24), C (12), O (16). The lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Mg (24). Sum is 36, which isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the sum as 25. So what elements sum to 25? 24 (Mg) +1 (H) =25? No, that's 25. Or 14 (N) + 11 (Na) =25. So perhaps X is a compound with Na and N.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a clear fit. Alternatively, perhaps the elements are O (16) and F (9), sum 25. So X could be something like NaF, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps X is something like NaNO2 (sodium nitrite). Then elements are Na (23), N (14), O (16*2). The lightest element is N (14), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 37, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). Elements are N (14), H (1), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing Cl and another element. For example, Cl (35) and O (16). Sum is 51, which isn't an option.

I'm running out of options. Maybe the correct answer is C) 31, which is 15 (O) + 16 (S), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is NaClO (sodium hypochlorite). Then elements are Na (23), Cl (35), O (16). So lightest is O (16), heaviest is Cl (35). Sum is 51, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl, elements Na (23) and Cl (35). Sum is 58, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe the elements are Cl (35) and another element like Na (23). Sum is 58, not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: the sum is 29. So what elements sum to 29? 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) =29. So perhaps X contains C and Cl.

So X could be something like CHCl3 (chloroform). But chloroform isn't a reagent in the same way, but more of a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CCl4 (carbon tetrafluoride), but that's not relevant.

Wait, or perhaps X is something like NaClO (sodium hypochlorite), which has elements Na, Cl, O. So lightest is O (16), heaviest is Cl (35). Sum is 51.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, but I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. The sum is likely 25, which would correspond to elements Na (23) and O (2?), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C) 31, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a compound containing Na (23) and O (16). Sum is 39, which isn't an option. But wait, if one of the elements is a heavier isotope, perhaps the Na is 25Na. So the heaviest element in X is 25Na, and the lightest is O (16). Sum is 25 + 16=41, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the heaviest isotope is Cl-35 (35), and the lightest is H (1). Sum is 36, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the heaviest isotope is Cl-35, and the lightest element is O (16). Sum is 35 +16=51, not an option.

Hmm. I think I'll have to settle on option C) 31, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) 25, which would correspond to Na (23) and O (2?), but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (with the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule), forms a precipitate G, and upon heating G, releases B (with a melting point close to 277 K). Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. CO₂ fits this condition, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Thus, W is likely CO₂, suggesting that X reacts with Y to release carbon dioxide.

2. **Precipitate G**: When G is heated, it releases B with a melting point of ~277 K (4°C). This suggests that B could be a hydrated salt or a carbonate that decomposes upon heating. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) decomposes into Na₂CO₃, CO₂, and H₂O, but its melting point (~270 K) is close to the given value.

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product contains two oxygen atoms, likely forming a carboxylate ion (COO⁻) when X reacts with the keto acid. This suggests that X is a base, such as NaOH, which deprotonates the keto acid.

4. **Substance X**: Based on the above, X is likely NaOH (sodium hydroxide), a strong base used in organic chemistry. NaOH reacts with acids to produce water and salts, and it can release CO₂ gas if reacting with a carbonate.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: X contains sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23) and oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16). The lightest element is O (16), and the heaviest is Na (23). Their cumulative atomic masses sum to 16 + 23 = 39. However, this does not match the given options.

6. **Revisiting the Options**:
   - **Option A (35)**: Could correspond to elements like Cl (35) and H (1), but there is no clear evidence that X contains Cl.
   - **Option B (25)**: Matches the sum of Na (23) and O (2), but O is not present in X as a lighter isotope.
   - **Option C (31)**: Could correspond to C (12) and S (19), but there is no clear evidence that X contains sulfur.
   - **Option D (29)**: Could correspond to C (12) and Cl (17), but again, there is no clear evidence that X contains chlorine.

Given the constraints and the analysis, the most plausible answer is **Option B (25)**, assuming a reinterpretation of the elements involved, even though the reasoning is not fully consistent with the given data.

ANSWER: B
