Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options give different possibilities for A and B. I need to figure out which reagents are suitable for each step.

Let me break down each part.

First Reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone like this reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN), I think that's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but wait, ketones are typically not as reactive as aldehydes in nucleophilic additions because the carbonyl is less electrophilic due to being adjacent to two alkyl groups. Oh wait, no. Wait, the reaction of ketones with HCN is possible under certain conditions. Or wait, wait, maybe this is a substitution reaction. Alternatively, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl. Let me think. In the presence of a base, maybe? Or acid?

Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's typically an addition reaction. For example, in the presence of a base, like hydroxide, the nucleophile could attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, if the carbonyl is attacked, that would form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the oxygen is from the original carbonyl, and the CN is added.

So, the product structure here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see the structure. The molecule would have a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that's also attached to two methyl groups and an OH. So, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but in this case, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methyl. So, the nitrile is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 has hydroxy and methyl groups. So, it's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, maybe I should count the carbons.

Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on C4. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is: CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. Or wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2COHCH2CN. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure, but I think the key is that it's a cyanohydrin.

So, the reaction of a ketone with HCN (or CN-) in the presence of a base or acid would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but HCN is a weak acid, so in a basic solution, CN- would be the nucleophile. Alternatively, in acidic conditions, perhaps.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, in the presence of acid, which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, and the CN- attacks. Or, in a base, deprotonation could occur.

Wait, the first reaction uses NaCN and reagent A. The product is a cyanohydrin. So, the reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group, which would form a cyanohydrin.

So, the conditions for forming a cyanohydrin from a ketone. I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the reaction between ketones and HCN (or CN-) occurs. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbon more positive, which attracts the nucleophilic CN-.

So, what is reagent A in this case? If A is H3O+ (acid), then that would make sense. Because H3O+ would provide the acidic conditions needed for the nucleophilic attack.

Looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl. Option B is A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. So, for the first step, A could be H3O+ if that's what the reaction requires.

Second Reaction: The product from the first step, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the starting material here is a nitrile (butanenitrile part) and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid. So, the reaction is converting a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The standard method involves hydrolysis with strong acid or base, typically with H2O and HCl or H2SO4, or using a base like NaOH and then acidifying.

Wait, but the starting material is a hydroxy-nitrile. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but in the second case, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure is (PhCH2Ph) attached to a carbon that also has OH and a nitrile group. Wait, perhaps it's a tertiary carbon with OH, CN, and two other groups, but I might be getting that wrong.

In any case, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. So, the reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The conditions for this require strong acid and water, or strong base and water followed by acid workup.

In the second reaction, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So, if the reaction is acid-catalyzed, then B would be HCl. Alternatively, if it's a base, then maybe something else.

Wait, let's think about the steps. Nitrile hydrolysis can occur under acidic or basic conditions. The general reaction is:

RCN + H2O → RCOOH (acidic conditions)
or
RCN + H2O → RCOONa (basic conditions, then acid to get RCOOH)

But in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. Hmm, maybe that's making the reaction a bit different.

Wait, but let's focus on the reagents. The second reaction uses reagent B along with H2O, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So, the most straightforward way is acid hydrolysis. So, reagent B would be an acid, like HCl.

Looking at the options, for B, options are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid) or others.

In the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that suggests acid conditions. So, in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → product.

In the second reaction, if B is HCl, then that would make sense for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

So, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. So, first step uses H3O+ (acid), second step uses HCl (acid). That seems plausible.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. Wait, HSO3- is a weak acid. NaHSO3, which would provide H+ and HSO3-? Not sure about that.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. Hmm, not sure about the first step.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the second reaction, would CH3COOH be a suitable acid? Let's think. For hydrolysis of the nitrile, you can use concentrated HCl as an acid. Alternatively, a weaker acid might not be strong enough to protonate the nitrile and facilitate the hydrolysis.

Wait, but hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic conditions, perhaps using HCl in H2O. So, for the second step, B should be HCl.

So, looking at the options, the correct A and B would be A = H3O+ (acid) for the first reaction, and B = HCl for the second.

But wait, let me double-check. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The conditions for that: typically, ketones react with HCN in the presence of a catalyst. But in this case, it's NaCN and A. So, NaCN provides CN- ions. If A is H3O+, that would make an acidic solution, allowing the CN- to attack the carbonyl. So that makes sense.

So, the first step uses H3O+ (acid) as reagent A, and the second step uses HCl as reagent B.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that the second reaction uses a base. Wait, no, because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is formed under acidic conditions.

Wait, another thought: when you hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you can use either strong acid or strong base. But if the starting material already has a hydroxyl group (as in the second reaction), maybe the base would deprotonate the hydroxyl, making it a better leaving group or something. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, perhaps the hydroxyl is deprotonated in a basic condition, making it an alkoxide. Then, the nitrile could undergo hydrolysis. But wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it must be under acidic conditions, or after base, you acidify.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the conditions. For nitrile hydrolysis, in acidic conditions (like HCl and H2O), it goes to the carboxylic acid. In basic conditions (like NaOH and H2O), it goes to the carboxylate, which then needs acidification to get the acid.

So, the second reaction uses reagent B and H2O. The product is the acid, so perhaps the conditions are acidic. So, B is HCl.

So, the first reaction uses A = H3O+ (acid) to form the cyanohydrin, and the second uses B = HCl (acid) to hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, let me look at option D: A=NaHSO3, B= HCl.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate. It's an acid, as it can donate H+ (HSO3- is a weak acid). So, if A is NaHSO3, that would provide H+ as well, perhaps sufficient for the first reaction.

Wait, but for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN: if A is NaHSO3, that would provide H+ and HSO3- as the counterion. But then, the H+ would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, and the CN- from NaCN would attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step requires a stronger acid. Hmm.

But wait, I'm not sure about the relative strengths. H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 would provide a weaker H+ (since HSO3- is a weaker acid than H3O+). But for the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl, perhaps a weak acid is sufficient. So, maybe either option is possible.

Wait, but the second reaction requires the nitrile to be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So, if B is HCl (option A and D for B), that would work. Or, if B is CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is a weak acid, perhaps that's not strong enough for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the nitrile is part of a larger molecule. Let me think about the structure of the starting material for the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and a substituent (like a benzyl group). So, the structure might be something like (PhCH2Ph)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3 or similar. Hmm, not sure, but the key is that the nitrile is adjacent to an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the presence of the alcohol affects the hydrolysis. If the nitrile is next to an alcohol, perhaps there's some kind of intramolecular reaction. But I don't think that's directly relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a straightforward hydrolysis but something else. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile is converted to a COOH group. So, the reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So, for that, in the second step, reagent B is HCl because that's a common reagent for acid-catalyzed nitrile hydrolysis.

So, going back to the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So, first reaction is acid-catalyzed cyanohydrin formation, second is nitrile to acid via HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. So, same B, but A is a weaker acid.

Wait, but can the first reaction proceed with NaHSO3 as the acid? I think it's possible because the carbonyl would be protonated. But I'm not certain whether H3O+ is necessary or if NaHSO3 would work.

Alternatively, perhaps in the first reaction, the carbonyl is protonated by H3O+ (strong acid) to form a better electrophile for CN- attack. So, reagent A should be H3O+.

Therefore, the correct answer would have A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but the options don't have option A with B=HCl. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So yes, option A has B=HCl. So, option A seems correct.

But wait, another thought: the second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So, that's a two-step process where the nitrile becomes an amide first, then a carboxylic acid. But in this case, perhaps it's a direct hydrolysis.

Alternatively, sometimes the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under strong acidic conditions, like with HCl, and heat. So, reagent B would be HCl.

So, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another thought: the second reaction's starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you would break the nitrile into a COOH group. But the molecule already has an OH group on the same carbon. So, would that interfere?

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis would occur at the nitrile group, converting it to COOH, but the OH group remains. So, the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, but in any case, the reaction is nitrile to acid, which requires H2O and acid (HCl). So, B is HCl.

So, putting it all together, option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction, acidic conditions are typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and facilitating the nucleophilic attack. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using reagent B and water. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Acidic conditions are required for this transformation, with HCl being a common reagent for acid-catalyzed nitrile hydrolysis. Among the options, **HCl** is the most suitable reagent for this step.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This combination is suitable for both reactions. Acidic conditions (H₃O⁺) facilitate the formation of the cyanohydrin in the first reaction, and HCl provides the acidic environment needed for nitrile hydrolysis in the second reaction.

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and may not provide sufficient acidic conditions for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction.

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid compared to H₃O⁺ and may not effectively facilitate the formation of the cyanohydrin in the first reaction.

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both NaHSO₃ and CH₃COOH are insufficient for their respective reactions due to their weaker acidic properties.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents for the given reactions are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, corresponding to **Option A**.
