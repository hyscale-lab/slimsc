Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I'll try to draw the structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. The substituents are: at position 1, an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), at position 2, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and at position 3, a nitro group (-NO2). So the substituents are in a meta arrangement with the ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think. The substituents are on carbons 1, 2, and 3. So maybe it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Wait, but the positions are 1,2,3 in a certain way. Alternatively, it's possible that the substituents are in a meta arrangement, but the exact order matters for the synthesis steps.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So we need to add these substituents step by step through various reactions.

I remember that when adding substituents to benzene, the order in which you add them can affect the product because of the directing effects of the substituents. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, while ethoxy groups and tert-butyl groups are ortho/para directors. So the order in which these groups are introduced will influence where the next substituent adds.

Let me list the substituents again: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Which substituents are being added first, second, and third?

I think the key is to add the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing groups. Maybe we'll need to consider the activating or deactivating nature of each group as well.

Let me think about each substituent:

- tert-butyl group: It's a strong activating group (alkyl group) and is an ortho/para director.
- Ethoxy group: Also activating (due to the lone pairs of oxygen), and is ortho/para directing.
- Nitro group: Deactivating (strongly electron-withdrawing), meta directing.

So the nitro group is a meta director, which will influence where the next substituents go. But if we add nitro last, then the other groups (tert-butyl and ethoxy) are activating, so they would be ortho/para directors.

Wait, but let me think about the desired product. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent to each other in a way that each is adjacent to the next. But that might not make sense because in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent (ortho) to two others, meta to one, and para to another.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. So, let's say the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, I need to figure out the correct order of addition.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see what the reaction sequences are. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reaction steps. Each step involves different reagents.

So each option is a series of reactions, and I need to figure out which sequence correctly adds the substituents in the right order to get the target molecule.

Let me think about each substituent's addition. The target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Let's think about the order in which these are added.

One approach is to add the substituents in the order that allows each step to direct the next group correctly.

Let's think: If I add the tert-butyl group first, then the ethoxy, and then the nitro, what would happen?

Wait, benzene is the starting material. First reaction would be Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride in presence of AlCl3. That would add the tert-butyl group as the first substituent.

So after step i, we have tert-butylbenzene.

Next, adding the ethoxy group. Friedel-Crafts is not usually used for ethers, or maybe we can use another method. Alternatively, perhaps an alkylation using a suitable reagent. Alternatively, maybe introducing an ethoxy group via a nucleophilic substitution or another method.

Wait, but adding ethoxy group can be done via a substitution reaction. For example, maybe using a nitration followed by some steps, but that's another approach.

Wait, but if after tert-butyl benzene, the next step is to add ethoxy via maybe a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps a sulfonation step to activate the ring for another substitution.

Wait, no, perhaps the steps involve nitration and other directing steps.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group.

2. Then introduce a nitro group in a position directed by the tert-butyl group.

But wait, the tert-butyl is an activating group, so it's ortho/para directing. So nitration would add the nitro group either ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

But the target has nitro in position 3. Let's consider the numbering.

Alternatively, maybe the order is different. Let me think about the target structure:

The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's imagine the benzene ring, with substituents in a 1-2-3 arrangement. So, if position 1 is ethoxy, then position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

Wait, but how would that form? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last because it's a strong deactivating group, which would not be ideal to add early as it would hinder further substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added first, but since it's a deactivating group, the subsequent substituents would be directed by it.

Wait, but the target has two activating groups and one deactivating. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the order is: first add the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy, and then the nitro.

But let me think about the positions. Let's say the first substituent is the tert-butyl at position para. No, wait, benzene is symmetric, so the first substituent can be anywhere, but the subsequent substituents depend on the directing effects.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group last because it's a deactivating group, which would make the ring less reactive, but maybe the other groups can be added in the correct positions relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Add tert-butyl (step 1: Friedel-Crafts).

2. Then add ethoxy group. Wait, how? Because after Friedel-Crafts, the ring is still activated with tert-butyl, so perhaps the next substitution is in the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via another Friedel-Crafts, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is used for alkylation, not for adding ethers. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires strong activating groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each reaction step in the options.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of benzene to get nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: Maybe a reduction? Or is it a step for something else. Oh, wait, Fe/HCl is often used in the Sandmeyer reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a step for introducing something else, like a substituent.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So after nitration, you add tert-butyl group.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Another nitration, but benzene already has nitro and tert-butyl.

Wait, the target has only one nitro group, so maybe this isn't correct.

Wait, the target has only one nitro group. So if option D's step iv is another nitration, that would give two nitro groups, which is not desired. So option D is probably incorrect.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4: Hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Maybe another reaction, like hydrolysis of a nitro group? Or maybe some kind of acid work-up.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: Perhaps an alkylation, like an SN2 reaction, maybe for adding an ethoxy group.

viii) Fe/HCl: Could be a reduction, but not sure.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4: Another nitration.

Hmm, this seems complicated. The target requires only one nitro group, so I'm not sure about option A.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl: Not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Hydrolysis of diazonium chloride.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: Maybe adding ethoxy via SN2.

viii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4: Acid treatment.

Hmm, this seems to include more than one nitration, which might not be correct.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl: Not sure.

v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: Another nitration.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4: Acid treatment.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: Adding ethoxy.

Again, multiple nitrations, which might not fit. The target has only one nitro group.

Wait, perhaps I'm not looking correctly. Let me think about each option's steps.

The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So the correct synthesis must involve adding these three groups in the correct order.

Looking at the options, each option's steps are a sequence of reactions. Let me try to outline what each step does.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: Maybe convert nitro to amine? Not sure. Fe and HCl are used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but that would require more specific conditions, like in the presence of a catalyst or maybe in a different setup.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But after nitration, the ring is deactivated. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. So if you have nitro (deactivating), you can't do Friedel-Crafts. So option D's step iii would not work because nitro is a meta director and deactivating, so FC alkylation would not proceed. So option D is likely incorrect.

Option A:

After step i: tert-butylbenzene.

Step ii: Nitration. So the nitro group will be directed by the tert-butyl group. Since tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director, the nitro will add either ortho or para to it.

Suppose the tert-butyl is at position 1. Then nitro can be at position 2 or 4.

Wait, the target has substituents at 1,2,3. So let's suppose, after adding tert-butyl (position 1), then nitration adds at position 2.

Then step iii is SO3/H2SO4. That's sulfonation. Sulfonic acid groups are strong activating, but they are meta directors. Wait, or are they para directors? No, sulfonic acid groups are meta directors because they are strong deactivating (due to the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group). Wait, no: wait, sulfonic acid (-SO3H) is a strong activating group? No, wait, no. Wait, sulfonic acid groups are deactivating because of the electron-withdrawing -SO3H group. So they are meta directors.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating based on whether they release electrons into the ring (activating) or withdraw electrons (deactivating). Electron-donating groups are activating (like -OCH3, -NH2, alkyl groups), while electron-withdrawing groups are deactivating (like -NO2, -SO3H).

So, after nitration, the ring has a nitro group (deactivating, meta director) and a tert-butyl group (activating, ortho/para). But after sulfonation (step iii in option A), adding a sulfonic acid group (a deactivating, meta director) to the ring. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Why would you sulfonate after nitrating? Maybe for directing purposes.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonation is for activating a position, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the order of adding substituents to achieve the correct positions.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

Let me imagine the substituents on the benzene ring as follows:

Position 1: ethoxy (-OCH2CH3)

Position 2: tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3)

Position 3: nitro (-NO2)

So the substituents are at adjacent positions: 1, 2, and 3. So, they are at every other carbon, which would form a meta arrangement between ethoxy and nitro, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps that would place each substituent correctly.

Let me think of each substituent's order of addition.

Option C:

Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl. So we have tert-butylbenzene.

Step ii: sulfonation with SO3/H2SO4. That adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a substituent. Now the ring has two substituents: tert-butyl and sulfonic acid.

Step iii: nitration. The sulfonic acid is a meta director, and the tert-butyl is ortho/para. So the nitration would occur at a position directed by both groups. Hmm, but which group is more influential? Since sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, perhaps it would dominate the directing effect.

Wait, but the ring already has a tert-butyl group, which is activating. So the nitration would be directed by the activating group. Nitro groups are deactivating, but during nitration, the nitronium ion attacks where the activating groups direct.

Wait, but if the ring has both activating and deactivating groups, the activating groups will dominate, directing the nitration. So the nitro would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3 relative to ethoxy. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added last, as it's a good activating group, and the other groups are in positions such that when the ethoxy is added, it's in the correct position.

Wait, but in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, which is next to the tert-butyl (position 2) and across from nitro (position 3? Or position 4? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves adding the nitro group first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director and deactivating. So after nitration, the ring is less reactive, making it harder to add substituents. But perhaps we can proceed.

Wait, if I nitrate benzene first (step i in option D), getting nitrobenzene. Then, if I try to do Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii in option D), but FC requires an activating group. Nitro is deactivating, so FC won't work. So option D is not feasible for adding the tert-butyl group after nitration.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add the tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But how would that work?

After adding tert-butyl (step i: FC alkylation), nitration would add nitro at ortho or para to tert-butyl. Then, how to add ethoxy.

Wait, but adding ethoxy typically requires a different method. For example, maybe adding a methoxy group via nucleophilic substitution or via an electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but in the presence of a nitro group (deactivating), the ring is less reactive. So adding an ethoxy group via FC might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction, such as using an alkoxide as a nucleophile.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly activated ring, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added using a directing group. For instance, if we have an activating group, like an ethyl group, which can be converted into an ethoxy group via some reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me return to the options and see which one has the correct sequence.

Looking at the target, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3. Let's imagine that the ethoxy is added first. But that would require directing the next substituent correctly.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added last. Let's see.

Suppose the sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add nitro group.

3. Add ethoxy group.

But how would that proceed.

Adding tert-butyl first: via FC alkylation.

Then, nitrating. The tert-butyl is activating, so nitro will go ortho or para to it.

Then, adding ethoxy. But how? Because after nitration, the ring has a nitro group (deactivating), making the ring less reactive. So adding an ethoxy group via FC might not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added using a different method. Maybe via a substitution reaction after activating the ring in another way.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via an O-alkylation after introducing a leaving group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the steps in option B.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. So nitro group added ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro group to amine? But that doesn't make sense here.

Hmm, maybe it's another step. Alternatively, perhaps it's a step to prepare for another substitution.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? But target has only one nitro.

So option B might not be correct.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Adding a sulfonic acid group, which is meta director.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, the ring has tert-butyl and sulfonic acid groups. Which directs the nitration? Since sulfonic acid is deactivating and meta, and tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para, I think the activating groups dominate, so nitration would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

Then step iv: Fe/HCl → maybe reduce something, but I'm not sure.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. So maybe the nitro group is being converted into a diazonium salt.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration. Hmm, this would add a second nitro group, which isn't desired.

So option C seems incorrect.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Nitro group added ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Now, the ring has tert-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid groups? Wait, that's three substituents. But the target has only three substituents, but we're only at step iii.

Wait, the target requires three substituents, so maybe the steps are building each one.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each substituent's position relative to each other.

The target has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents in a way that each is adjacent to the next.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group first.

2. Then add tert-butyl group.

3. Then add nitro group.

But adding nitro after ethoxy and tert-butyl would be tricky because the ring would have activating groups, making nitration possible.

Wait, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring is highly activated, so nitration would proceed. But where would the nitro group go?

Let me think: ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2. The nitro would need to go to position 3.

But how to direct that.

Wait, the ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. The tert-butyl is also activating, ortho/para. So when adding the nitro group, the possible positions would be directed by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group can be added at a position that's meta to one substituent and ortho to another.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but that would deactivate the ring, making it hard to add other groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add nitro group, directed to position 3 relative to tert-butyl.

3. Then add ethoxy group in position 1 or 2.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option B.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. So nitro group added ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Suppose tert-butyl is at position 1. Then nitro could be at position 2 or 4.

Then, step iii is Fe/HCl. I'm not sure, but maybe Fe/HCl is a step for sulfonation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the next step is to sulfonate, but option B doesn't include that.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option B are:

tert-butyl → nitro → Fe/HCl (maybe something else) → nitrate again, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the steps involved in each option.

Looking at option D again:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps convert nitro to something else. Wait, maybe it's a step for making a diazonium salt, but that usually involves NaNO2 and HCl, not Fe/HCl.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each step.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing, because nitrobenzene isn't easily reactive towards Fe/HCl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → but nitro is deactivating, so FC won't proceed. So option D is invalid.

So, perhaps option C is better.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Now, the ring has tert-butyl and sulfonic acid groups.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, where does the nitro group go?

Since the ring has both tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta) groups. The activating groups dominate, so the nitro would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

But if the tert-butyl is in position 1, the nitro could be in 2 or 4.

Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Not sure.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. So perhaps the nitro group is being converted to a diazonium salt.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration. Hmm, this would add another nitro group, but the target has only one. So perhaps this is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro.

The correct order of addition would be such that each group is added in a position directed correctly by the existing groups.

Let me think of adding the tert-butyl first, then the nitro, and then the ethoxy.

But how?

After adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated. Nitration would add nitro at ortho or para.

Then, adding ethoxy. But after nitration, the ring has a nitro group (deactivating), making it harder to add substituents. So perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating a position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different approach, like using a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction, such as using an ether in the presence of a strong base, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added last, after the nitro and tert-butyl groups are in place. But the challenge is to get the ethoxy to the correct position.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly activated ring, which might not be feasible here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via an O-alkylation after the ring has a suitable leaving group, such as a nitro group being converted into a leaving group.

Wait, but nitro groups aren't typically good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a diazonium salt, which can leave, creating a good position for substitution.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve diazotization and then introducing the ethoxy group. But that's getting a bit complex.

Let me think about the steps again.

Looking at option A:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate: adds nitro.

iii) Sulfonate: adds sulfonic acid.

iv) Diazotization.

v) H3O+, H2O/Heat: perhaps hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH and EtBr: maybe SN2, adding ethoxy.

vii) Fe/HCl.

viii) HNO3/H2SO4.

ix) Dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, multiple steps that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option A adds the tert-butyl, then nitro, then sulfonic acid, then some other steps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkylation using NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2 reaction. So in the presence of a good leaving group, like a sulfonic acid group, perhaps the ethoxy can be added.

Wait, but how would that happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is used as a leaving group via a substitution reaction. For example, if after sulfonation, the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but sulfonic acid groups are strong - they are not good leaving groups under normal conditions. However, under strongly basic conditions, perhaps they can be deprotonated and act as leaving groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is converted into a tosylate or something else, which can act as a leaving group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too detailed, but perhaps I should think about which option correctly adds each substituent.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl (position 2).

2. Add nitro group (position 3), which is meta to tert-butyl.

Wait, but tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, so nitro would go ortho or para, not meta.

Ah, so that's a problem. Because tert-butyl is ortho/para directing, the nitro group would not go meta to it. So perhaps the nitro group is added last, after another substituent that directs it to the correct position.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first.

But if I add ethoxy first, then the next substituent (tert-butyl) would be directed ortho or para to ethoxy.

Then, the nitro group would be directed meta to the ethoxy or tert-butyl.

Hmm.

Let me think:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene: via, say, a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts, but that's for alkyl groups, not ethers. Oh, wait, perhaps via a substitution after making a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nitration step first, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene (position 1).

2. Then, add tert-butyl group at position 3 (meta to nitro), but that's impossible because nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would go meta to it.

Wait, no, the substituent would go meta to the nitro group. So if nitro is at position 1, the next substituent would be at position 3.

So after nitration, we have nitro at 1. Then, tert-butyl is added at position 3 (meta to nitro). Then, we need to add ethoxy at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so adding tert-butyl (which requires FC alkylation) is not possible because FC requires activating groups.

Ah, so the problem is that if nitro is added first, the ring is deactivated, making further substitution via FC impossible.

So that approach won't work.

Alternative approach: Add tert-butyl first, which activates the ring.

Then, nitrate to add nitro ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Then, add ethoxy group in a position that's adjacent to both.

Wait, but how?

Perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via a substitution after activating the ring in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl (via FC).

2. Add nitro group (ortho to tert-butyl).

3. Then, add ethoxy group via a substitution, perhaps using a leaving group created from another substituent.

But I'm not sure about this.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Option C:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate: So now, the ring has tert-butyl and sulfonic acid. Nitration would be directed by the activating groups.

Wait, but sulfonic acid is deactivating, so the nitro would be directed by the tert-butyl.

But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group last, using a substitution reaction after the ring has a suitable leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an O-alkylation after making a nitro group into a diazonium salt, which is then replaced.

Wait, let's think: after adding tert-butyl and nitro in the correct positions, perhaps we can create a leaving group (like a diazonium salt) and then substitute with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → what? Maybe nothing.

iii) Add tert-butyl via FC → but FC won't work on nitrobenzene because it's deactivating. So this step won't work. So option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I've been missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the synthesis involves adding the ethoxy group via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding the ethyl group as an ethyl chloride, but that's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction where a chloride is replaced by an ethoxide. But how would that happen on a benzene ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), which requires a strongly activated ring (like with electron-withdrawing groups) and a good leaving group.

But in the target, the ethoxy group is in a position where the ring is activated by the tert-butyl group. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a nitro group and activating a certain position.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Another thought: the target substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, perhaps the nitro is at position 3, the ethoxy at position 1, and the tert-butyl at position 2. So, the nitro is meta to the ethoxy and para to the tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group in the ortho position.

3. Add nitro group in the meta position to ethoxy, which is adjacent to tert-butyl.

But how to do that.

Adding ethoxy first: via a Friedel-Crafts is not possible because FC is for alkylation. Ethoxy is an ether, so perhaps via nucleophilic substitution after making a suitable leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps via a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps via a substitution after making the ring activated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a nitro group and activating the ring with another group.

But this is getting too convoluted.

At this point, perhaps I should look for which option correctly adds each substituent in the correct order.

The target has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Assuming the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But how.

Option A:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assume position 2.

iii) Sulfonate → adds a sulfonic acid group.

iv) Diazotization.

v) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt to a phenol, but that's unclear).

vi) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, adding ethoxy group.

vii) Fe/HCl → maybe reducing something.

viii) Dilute H2SO4.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

This seems to have too many steps, but perhaps:

In option A, after adding tert-butyl, nitrate to add nitro. Then sulfonate, which may activate a position. Then, diazotization and hydrolysis could introduce a hydroxyl group, which is then alkylated with EtBr in basic conditions to form ethoxy.

Wait, that could make sense. Let's think:

After adding tert-butyl and nitro groups, you sulfonate. Then, you create a diazonium salt (diazotization), which upon hydrolysis gives a phenol group. Then, that phenol is treated with NaOH and EtBr, which would undergo an SN2 reaction to form ethoxy.

But would that work? Let me outline:

1. Benzene → tert-butylbenzene (step i).

2. Nitration → nitro at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl) → 2-nitrotoluene.

3. Sulfonation → sulfonic acid group added, probably at position 4 (para to tert-butyl) or position 3 (meta to nitro). Not sure.

4. Diazotization (step iv) → convert nitro to diazonium chloride.

Wait, nitro is at position 2. Diazotization would require the nitro group to be activated, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so diazotization is typically done on aryl amines, not nitro groups. So perhaps this step is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions. Diazotization is done on amines, not nitro groups. Nitro groups can't be directly converted into diazonium salts. So, option A's step iv (NaNO2/HCl) would not work on a nitro group. Therefore, option A's step iv is incorrect.

That means option A is not feasible.

Likewise, looking at option B:

Step iii is Fe/HCl. Not sure what that does. Maybe it's used in a different context.

I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate → nitro in ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iv) Fe/HCl → not sure.

v) Diazotization → again, this would require an amine, not nitro.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

This doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the tert-butyl first, then the nitro, and then the ethoxy via a substitution. But which option does that?

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → but target has only one nitro.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I dismissed it earlier because the FC step wouldn't work after nitration.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option D.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But that requires more specific conditions, like using H2/Pd or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Fe/HCl is used in a different reaction.

If step ii is attempted, but it doesn't work, then FC in step iii won't proceed.

So, option D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Let me think again about option B's steps.

Option B:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro in ortho or para.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing, or maybe it's a typo and should be something else.

iv) Nitrate again → which would add another nitro, which is incorrect.

So option B is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate → nitro in ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing.

v) Diazotize → again, this requires an amine, not nitro, so not possible.

So option C's steps don't make sense.

I'm stuck, but I think the correct option is option D.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think about option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing.

iii) Add tert-butyl via FC → but can't, since nitro is deactivating.

So option D's step iii is invalid.

Thus, none of the options look correct, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked option A.

Option A's steps:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at ortho or para.

iii) Sulfonate → adds another group.

iv) Diazotize → but nitro can't be converted to diazonium.

v) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH and EtBr → add ethoxy.

vii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce something.

viii) Dilute H2SO4.

ix) HNO3 → another nitration.

But in this case, the nitro group would be added again, which is not desired.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

Looking at option B:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe an intermediate step.

iv) Nitrate again → which is incorrect.

So perhaps option B isn't the right choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate → nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

v) Diazotize → can't do on nitro.

Hmm, not making sense.

Another approach: The target has three substituents. Let's imagine the synthesis steps include adding each substituent one by one.

The first substituent is tert-butyl (via FC).

The second is nitro (directed by tert-butyl).

The third is ethoxy, which must be added in a position that's adjacent to the nitro and tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after introducing a leaving group, like a nitro group converted into a diazonium salt.

Wait, but again, without the correct steps, it's hard.

After much thinking, I think the correct option is option D, but I'm not sure.

The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, which would be directed to the ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
4. **Step iv**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) is used to form a diazonium salt, but this requires an amine, not a nitro group, so this step is invalid.
5. **Step vi**: NaOH and EtBr are used for an SN2 reaction, potentially adding the ethoxy group, but the sequence of steps does not align with the target structure.
6. **Step ix**: Another nitration step would introduce an additional nitro group, which is not desired.

**Conclusion**: Option A is invalid due to the incorrect use of diazotization and the introduction of an extra nitro group.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, directed by the tert-butyl group.
3. **Step iii**: Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose but does not align with the target structure.
4. **Step iv**: Another nitration step introduces an additional nitro group, which is not desired.

**Conclusion**: Option B is invalid due to the introduction of an extra nitro group.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, but the directing effects of the tert-butyl and sulfonic acid groups make it unclear where the nitro group would be placed.
4. **Step iv**: Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose.
5. **Step v**: Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) is used to form a diazonium salt, but this requires an amine, not a nitro group, so this step is invalid.
6. **Step vi**: Another nitration step introduces an additional nitro group, which is not desired.

**Conclusion**: Option C is invalid due to the incorrect use of diazotization and the introduction of an extra nitro group.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is unclear in its purpose but does not align with the target structure.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group, but this step is invalid because the nitro group is a deactivating substituent, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group.

**Conclusion**: Option D is invalid due to the inability to perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation after nitration.

### Final Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences provided correctly lead to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option A** is the closest to being correct, as it partially aligns with the required steps, despite the issues identified.

**Answer: A**
