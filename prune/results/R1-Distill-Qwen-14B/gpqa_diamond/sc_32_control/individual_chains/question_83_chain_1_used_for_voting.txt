Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're asked to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So first, let's break this down. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with NaOH (a strong base), the reaction will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate.

But before that, let's think about the initial dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. Diluting a solution usually means the concentration decreases because the volume increases. So the initial concentration after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 20 + 20 = 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40? Wait, 0.05 * 20 is 1, and divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's figure out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So first, calculate moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³ (which is 0.04 L), concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So volume needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question mentions 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, that's the 25% point.

So let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

Starting with the 25% point.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is 1:1, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH would add 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. So moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The NaOH converts some of the acetic acid to acetate ions. So moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is the original 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425.

Let me compute these. 

0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M (approx)
0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M (approx)

So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, so approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D is 4.57. Option C is 4.73. So maybe 4.26 is one part.

Wait, but wait—did I compute the concentrations correctly? Let me double-check.

Moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477, which gives pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So about 4.26. So the first part of the answer is 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point: moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ (equivalence volume) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The acetate concentration is 0.02 M. We can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], which will be small because Kb is small.

So:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait a second, but none of the options have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Hmm. Wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake in calculating Kb?

Wait, 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct. So Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute [OH^-] again.

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So yes, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is about 4.98, pH is about 9.02.

But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Options: A)4.26;8.52; B)3.17;6.73; C)4.73;7.00; D)4.57;6.92.

Ah, so none have 9.02. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial calculations. Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the concentration of acetate at equivalence point.

Wait, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The volume is 40 + 10 =50 cm³. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

So let me re-calculate.

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5 → pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps when the solution reaches the equivalence point, the solution is not just the acetate ion. Since NaOH is a strong base, maybe I need to consider its hydrolysis correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not that simple because when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, the acetate is the conjugate base, but perhaps the solution is not just acetate in water. Wait, no, the NaOH is fully dissociated, but in the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate, and the solution is sodium acetate in solution. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

So if the calculation is correct, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the Kb again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = 5.4054e-10. Correct.

So, C = 0.02 M.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the approximation that x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So OH- is 1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, the equivalence point calculation may not be correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles or concentrations.

Wait, the initial diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, let's compute the moles again.

Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So they exactly neutralize each other, producing 0.001 mol of acetate in a solution of 40 +10 =50 cm³.

So acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait—when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, the solution becomes sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should indeed be basic, pH>7.

But the options don't have a pH of around 9. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the solution isn't just the acetate; maybe the solution is not as I thought. Wait, no, the NaOH is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate, and the acetic acid will fully react with it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.733.

Another approach: perhaps using the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The formula for pH is:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C )

Wait, no. Alternatively, when dealing with a weak base, the pH can be found using the Kb and concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximations. Let's not assume x is negligible.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 -x) → x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

This is a quadratic equation: x^2 +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 ≈ 29.218e-20 = 2.9218e-19.

4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. Wait, but in the formula, 4ac is 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. But in the discriminant, it's 4ac multiplied by 1, so 4ac = -4.324e-11? Wait no, wait, the quadratic equation is x² + bx + c=0. So in our case, it's x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11 =0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = 2.9218e-19 + 4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19. So D ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root, so x≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (approx 6.576e-6)/2 → ~3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486.

pH =14 -5.486≈8.514.

So pH≈8.51. Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

Wait, but earlier I thought the pH would be about 9.02. So why is there a discrepancy? Oh, because in the initial approximation, I assumed x was small, but in reality, when I do the full quadratic solution, x is about 3.288e-6, which is about 1.6e-5 compared to 0.02, which is 2e-2. So 3e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so the assumption was correct. Wait, wait, wait—this doesn't make sense. Because in the quadratic solution, x was about 3.288e-6, which is small compared to 0.02, so the initial approximation holds. So why the discrepancy in pH?

Wait, because when I first calculated with x=1.04e-5, I got pH=9.02. But the quadratic solution gives x=3.288e-6, leading to pH≈8.51. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, let's recalculate the quadratic formula.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x -1.081e-11 =0.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11.

Wait, because c is negative, so 4ac becomes positive.

Wait, no: The equation is x² +bx +c=0. So in our case, it's x^2 + (5.405e-10)x + (-1.081e-11) =0.

So D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = 2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D) is sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

The positive root is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6 → [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

So that's about 8.51. So the correct equivalence point pH is around 8.51, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, and the 25% titration pH is around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but earlier when I did the 25% titration, I got pH≈4.26, which matches option A's first value.

But wait, let me double-check the 25% titration part.

At 25% titration: 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 L =0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles after reaction: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration [HA]=0.00075/0.0425≈0.017647 M.

Concentration [A^-]=0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

pH= pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])=4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.733 + log(0.3333)=4.733 -0.477≈4.256≈4.26.

So that part seems correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point by equating the moles of acetic acid to the moles of NaOH. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of NaOH required for equivalence are the same, so the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{C_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The \(K_b\) for acetate is calculated from \(K_w / K_a\):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\), the hydroxide ion concentration \([OH^-]\) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[CH_3COO^-] - x}, \quad \text{where } x = [OH^-].
\]

Assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 M, we approximate:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [CH_3COO^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([OH^-]) = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using a more accurate quadratic solution confirms that the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

For the 25% titration point, 25% of the equivalence volume (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forming:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\), we find:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52**

Answer: A
