Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule's energy state transition when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. The question is about the fundamental state and the next lowest energy state after absorbing a photon.

First, let me gather what the question gives. The molecule is made of elements X and Y. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s.

The question asks for the momentum of the photon needed to switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think this means the next state is the first excited state, which probably involves either a change in vibrational or rotational energy, or both.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energies. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused—could it be only a vibrational transition, or a rotational one?

I recall that in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. In the rigid rotor, B is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. But wait, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the rotation-vibration model, allowing for some stretching of the bond. But maybe for this problem, the main thing is to consider the vibrational transition because the photon's energy would relate to the vibrational energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can go to the next state, which could be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). But since the question asks for the lowest possible energy transition, I think it should be the smallest energy change. Let's compute both possibilities.

But wait, the vibrational energy levels have a much higher spacing than rotational ones. Oh no, wait, no—actually, the spacing between rotational energy levels is usually smaller. Let me think. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ℏ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (½) m ω² (v + ½). 

Wait, no, the energy spacing between vibrational levels is (½) m ω² (v+1) - (½) m ω² v = (½) m ω². So each vibrational step is a ΔE_vib = ½ m ω². On the other hand, the rotational energy levels' spacing depends on J. For example, from J=0 to J=1: ΔE_rot = B*(1*(1+1)) - B*(0*(0+1)) = 2B - 0 = 2B. But B is proportional to ℏ²/(I), which for diatomic molecules is (ℏ²/(2μ R²)), where μ is the reduced mass.

But the vibrational energy spacing is probably much larger than the rotational spacing. Because ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is a high frequency, implying a large energy spacing. Let me compute both the vibrational and rotational energy changes and see which is smaller.

So first, let's compute the vibrational energy change. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = (½) μ ω² ( (v+1) - v ) * 1, because each vibrational state adds a certain amount. Wait, the standard expression for vibrational energy is E_vib = (v + ½) h ν, where ν is the frequency. Since ω = 2π ν, so ν = ω/(2π). So the energy spacing between adjacent vibrational levels is h ν = (h ω)/(2π) = ħ ω, because ħ = h/(2π), so ħ ω = (h ω)/(2π) = h ν. So the energy change ΔE_vib = ħ ω.

Now for the rotational change: from J=0 to J=1. The energy change is ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = [ (ℏ² / (2I) ) * 1*(1+1) ] - [ ... J=0 term ] = (2 ℏ²)/(2I) )= ℏ²/(I). 

So the question is whether ΔE_rot is smaller or larger than ΔE_vib.

But wait, let's compute the numerical values.

First, calculate the reduced mass μ of the diatomic molecule. The reduced mass is given by μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting amu to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Then, the moment of inertia I is μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, calculate ΔE_rot = ℏ²/(I). Planck's constant ℏ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So:

ℏ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that's a very small energy. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 squared is (1.05457)^2 = about 1.112, so 1.112e-68. Divided by I = 1.208e-46 kg m². So 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = (1.112 /1.208) * 1e-22 = approx 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy change is ΔE_vib = ħ ω. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. ω is 4e14 rad/s. So:

ΔE_vib = 1.05457e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two, ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J, which is smaller than ΔE_vib ≈4.2e-20 J. So, the energy required for a rotational transition is much less than the vibrational one. But wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase.

Wait, but wait again. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think is v=0 and J=0. So the next possible state could be either v=0, J=1 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). The energy difference for J=1 is much smaller than that for v=1. Therefore, if the photon provides the energy for the J=1 transition, the molecule would require less energy. But the question is about the momentum of the photon. Hmm.

Wait, but in reality, can the molecule make a transition that only changes J without changing v? Because the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid rotor allows for some vibration, meaning that J and v can change. But perhaps in the ro-vibrational coupling, transitions can involve both. However, for the lowest energy transition, the molecule would prefer the smallest energy change possible, which would be the rotational transition. But wait, I'm not sure if the question is considering only allowed transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the transition from the ground state to the next state, which could be a simultaneous change in both v and J. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the model allows for the photon to be absorbed for either a rotational or vibrational transition, and the question is asking for the photon that causes the smallest possible energy change.

But the options given are all in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Wait, the photon's momentum is p = E/c, since for a photon, E = pc. So if we can find the energy required (either ΔE_rot or ΔE_vib) and then find p = E/c.

Wait, but why would the photon's momentum be related to the energy? Right, because the energy of the photon is E = pc. So if we can find the correct ΔE, we can find p.

So, let's compute both ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib, then see which p is in the options.

But earlier, I found ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J, and ΔE_vib ≈4.2e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the moment of inertia.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = Let's compute that.

1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈3.02e-27 kg.

Moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

So, ΔE_rot = (ℏ²) / I.

ℏ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ℏ squared is (1.05e-34)^2 = approx 1.10e-68 (J·s)^2.

So ΔE_rot = 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.1/1.2) * 1e-22 = approx 0.917e-22 J, which is 9.17e-23 J.

So yes, 9e-23 J. Whereas the vibrational energy is 4.2e-20 J, which is much larger.

But the question is, which transition is the one that the molecule would make when it absorbs a photon to go to the next lowest energy state. Because the rotational transition requires less energy, that would be the one with the smaller ΔE. So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J.

Now, compute the photon's momentum p. Since E_photon = pc, so p = E/c.

c is speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So 3e-31 kg·m/s is 3e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any of the options. That can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the transition is rotational. Maybe the question refers to the vibrational transition, and I'm miscalculating the energy.

Wait, the vibrational energy ΔE_vib is ħ ω. Let me compute that again.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s, ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So E = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s, which is 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options: Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is a bit higher.

But wait, why would the photon cause a vibrational transition? Because the rotational transition requires much less energy, so why would the question suggest that the photon has to provide the vibrational energy?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model. The question says it's the rotation-vibration model, which means that both rotational and vibrational energies are considered, but perhaps the photon must cause a transition to the next state, which could involve a change in either or both. But in terms of energy, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the answer in the order of 1e-28 Ns, which is the vibrational energy?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a pure rotational or vibrational transition, but a transition that involves both. But the next state with the lowest possible energy might still be the rotational one because it's lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model in question treats the molecule as a non-rigid rotor, which allows for simultaneous changes in rotation and vibration. But for the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which of these has a lower energy?

Well, for the energy of the rotational state, at J=1, the energy is (h c B) * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is in cm−1, but perhaps it's easier to compute the energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energies numerically.

Rotational energy at J=1: E_rot = (ℏ² / (2I)) * J(J+1). At J=0, E_rot=0. At J=1, E_rot = (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2.

Vibrational energy at v=1: E_vib = (½) m ω² ( (1 + ½) - (0 + ½) ) * something? Wait, no. The vibrational energy is given by E_vib = (v + ½) h ν. So the change from v=0 to v=1 is h ν.

But since the question is about the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest possible energy would be one where the energy is the smallest possible increase. So the rotational transition would require less energy (since 9e-23 J is less than 4e-20 J). So the photon's energy should be 9e-23 J, which would correspond to a momentum of p= E/c ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s, but none of the options are that small.

Wait, that's a problem. None of the options are close to that. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the correct transition is vibrational, and the rotational calculation is not the intended path.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moment of inertia calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu. Yes.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m². That seems right.

Then, ΔE_rot = (ℏ²) / I = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46.

Wait, let me compute that again more accurately.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = approx 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.208e-46: 1.112e-68 /1.208e-46 = (1.112/1.208) * 1e-22 = approx 0.92 *1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J. So that's correct.

But the options' momenta are much larger. So perhaps I'm missing something in the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the transition from J=0 to J=1, but from v=0 to v=1. Because the rotational transition's momentum is way too small, but the vibrational is in the right ballpark.

So, for the vibrational transition, E_photon = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Then, p_photon = E_photon / c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options: option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. So that's a match.

But earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, but perhaps in this model, the transition is vibrational. Maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Wait, why would that be the case? Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next energy level, which would be the first vibrational excited state, v=1, J=0. Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, but perhaps in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are not allowed or are not considered here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the transitions involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states. But to go to the next state, you can either increase v or J. But the transition with the least energy is the rotational one. But the options don't have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the model. Maybe the question is referring to the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) but the lowest rotational state (J=0) to the next state, which would involve only a vibrational change. Because perhaps the rotational states have higher energy than the vibrational in some cases, but that doesn't make sense because the vibrational energy is much higher.

Wait, no, the vibrational energy levels are much higher than rotational. So the next state after v=0, J=0 is either v=1, J=0 (which is higher) or v=0, J=1 (which is lower than v=1, J=0). So the order of energies is: v=0, J=0 (lowest), v=0, J=1, v=1, J=0, v=0, J=2, etc.

So the next state with the lowest energy is v=0, J=1. So the energy required would be the rotational transition, which is much lower. But as I computed earlier, the momentum for that is negligible, way below the options given.

Hmm. So perhaps the question is referring to a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes, but that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the model being used here is only considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, the question states that the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which combines both vibrations and rotations. So perhaps the allowed transitions require absorption of a photon that can cause a transition from (v, J) = (0,0) to (1,1), but that's more complicated. Or perhaps the question is actually asking about the fundamental vibrational transition, and the rotational part is a distractor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Another approach: Maybe the question is asking about the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state, but perhaps the rotational state isn't considered. So the next state is the first vibrational excited state, which would require the photon's energy to be the vibrational energy spacing.

In that case, the photon's momentum would be p = ħ ω / c.

Wait, no, because p = E/c, and E = ħ ω. So p = (ħ ω)/c.

Wait, let me compute that.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħ * ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s =1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this calculation.

So perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational. Or perhaps the rotational transition isn't allowed because the model used in the question is the non-rigid rotor, and that allows for simultaneous changes, but the lowest transition is the vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which would require the photon to provide the vibrational energy.

So the correct answer would be option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But wait, why isn't the rotational transition considered, since it's lower energy? Because in the options, the rotational transition's momentum is much smaller than any of the options. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the ΔE, but the angular momentum. But no, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The photon's momentum p is E/c, which is correct. So if the energy is 4.22e-20 J, then p is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So despite the rotational transition requiring less energy and hence a smaller p, the options don't have such a small value. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which requires a photon with p ≈1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state \( v = 0 \) and the lowest rotational state \( J = 0 \). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) or a rotational transition (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   - The energy spacing between vibrational levels is given by \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega \), where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).
   - Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), we find:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   - The energy spacing for rotational transitions is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \), where \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia.
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu}) (2 \, \text{amu})}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
   - The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
   - Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \), we find:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)):
     \[
     p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
   - For the rotational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy and thus a smaller photon momentum (\( \sim 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)), but this value is not among the provided options. The vibrational transition, on the other hand, results in a photon momentum of \( \sim 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), which matches option D. Therefore, the intended answer is based on the vibrational transition.

**Answer: D**
