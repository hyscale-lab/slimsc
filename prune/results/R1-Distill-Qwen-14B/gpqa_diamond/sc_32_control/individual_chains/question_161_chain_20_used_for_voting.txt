Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions, right? So the question says Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He's got vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. But even then, some gas particles are left, and the mean free path of these is λ1.

Wait, when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. He noticed this. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

I remember that the mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. The formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), something like that. Where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure.

But wait, when the electron beam is on, what's happening? The electrons are moving through the gas. Oh right, the electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe get excited. Or perhaps the beam's presence increases the effective pressure because the electrons are scattering off the gas, causing the mean free path to change.

Wait, in the initial state without the beam, the mean free path λ1 is based purely on the gas particles colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are also interacting with the gas molecules. So the electrons cause more collisions—so the gas molecules are now colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons.

Wait, but in the initial scenario, the mean free path λ1 is determined by the gas particles' own interactions. When the beam is on, the electrons may be causing additional scattering. So for the electrons, their mean free path would be different, but the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. Or wait, maybe the question is considering the electron's mean free path? Wait, the question says that the mean free path of the gas molecules was λ1, but when the beam starts, the mean free path changes. Wait no, the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2.

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read again. Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules to be λ1. Then, when the electron beam is on, he found the mean free path was λ2. But the temperature remains the same.

So why would the mean free path of the gas molecules change? Because the presence of the electron beam could cause gas ionization. When the electrons hit the gas molecules, they can strip off electrons from them—ionizing them. Once the gas is ionized, the ions and electrons will respond differently to the electric fields in the microscope.

Wait, but wait a second. The mean free path of the gas molecules is based on their collisions. If the gas becomes ionized, the ions and electrons would have different behaviors. But for the gas molecules, if they are ionized, they may no longer be neutral and might have different cross-sections for collisions. Or maybe the presence of the electron beam changes the effective pressure because of increased collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam introduces more energy into the system. If the gas is heated, the temperature might increase. But the question says the temperature remained the same, so that's not it. So maybe the presence of the beam doesn't change the thermal motion but affects the collision mechanisms.

Wait, the mean free path equation is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to have more interactions, perhaps the effective collision cross-section σ increases.

Because the electrons are charged, when they hit the gas molecules, it could cause the gas molecules to break apart or change state. Alternatively, the gas molecules might have more charge, affecting their interactions.

Wait, maybe when the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged and therefore their collision cross-section increases. Because charged particles interact more strongly, so each collision is more likely, reducing the mean free path.

So in this case, if the gas becomes ionized, each molecule would be more likely to collide with others because of their charge, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1. Because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the number density and the collision cross-section.

Alternatively, if the gas was initially neutral and then ionized, the cross-section (σ) would increase. So 1/(n σ) would decrease, so λ would decrease.

But wait, the number density n is pressure divided by (k*T), right? But if the pressure is the same, and T is same, n is same. So if σ increases, λ decreases. So λ2 is less than λ1.

Therefore, the correct conclusion would be λ2 < λ1. So looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: Could the electron beam cause the gas molecules to move faster? No, because the temperature is the same. So thermal speed is same. So the only change would be in the collision cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces more particles into the system, but that's unlikely because the initial setup was already under ultra-high vacuum.

Wait, another angle: Mean free path is calculated based on the gas's behavior. But if the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, creating ions and electrons, perhaps the gas density effectively increases because ionization breaks molecules into smaller particles. So number density increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but if the gas is fully ionized into ions and electrons, each ion is a fraction of the original molecule's mass. So for example, if a molecule breaks into two atoms, each ion would be half the mass, but the number density would double. That would increase n, so λ would decrease.

In that case, λ2 would be smaller than λ1, because n is higher.

So whether it's because σ increases or n increases, λ decreases.

Therefore, the conclusion is λ2 < λ1, so option C.

The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules is determined by the number density (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), following the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot \sigma}
\]

Initially, Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum state to be λ₁. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ₂. The temperature of the system remained constant, so the number density (n) based on pressure and temperature would not change. 

The key factor influencing the change in λ is the collision cross-section (σ). When the electron beam is active, it can ionize the gas molecules. Ionized gas molecules (ions and electrons) have different behaviors compared to neutral molecules. Specifically, charged particles interact more strongly due to electrostatic forces, increasing the effective collision cross-section (σ). Additionally, ionization can break gas molecules into smaller fragments, effectively increasing the number density (n) of particles in the system.

Both an increase in σ and a potential increase in n lead to a decrease in the mean free path. Therefore, λ₂, the mean free path under the influence of the electron beam, is shorter than λ₁. This conclusion aligns with the observation that the mean free path decreases when the electron beam is active.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**C) λ₂ < λ₁**
