Okay, so I have this crystallography problem here about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance in a crystal structure usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms, right? But in a rhombohedral structure, that could be along the edges of the unit cell. So each edge of the rhombohedral unit cell has a length 'a' which is 10 Angstroms in this case.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same, so that makes sense. So it's a rhombohedral (or trigonal) crystal system.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. The formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ), but wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = (a²(b² c² - ... )) no, wait, no, that's for something else. Oh right, the correct formula is d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) ]^(-1/2)... no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, another thought: for a cubic crystal, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in non-cubic systems, the formula gets more complicated.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = (1 / √( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ )) )) × (a² b² c² / (a² b² c²))^(1/2) Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, where a = b = c and α = β = gamma, the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system is:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) ]^(-1/2) ) 

Wait, no, maybe it's better to look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up now. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... ) ]^(−1/2), but the specifics are getting me confused.

Wait another approach: In a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c = a0 (let's say a0 is 10 Angstroms), and all angles are equal, the formula for interplanar distance simplifies.

I think the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because in a cubic system, when α is 90 degrees, the cos terms would drop out, giving the standard formula. So for cubic, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). So maybe for rhombohedral, the formula is:

d = [ a^2 (h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α ) ]^(-1/2 )

Because in rhombohedral, all angles are the same, so all terms have cos α.

Wait, so substituting the values:

Given a =10 Angstroms, angles α = β = gamma = 30 degrees. The plane is (111), so h=k=l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α )

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when all angles are 30 degrees, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So let's compute the denominator:

h² +k² + l² = 1 + 1 +1 = 3.

The cross terms: 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α.

Since h=k=l=1, each term is 2*1*1 * cos 30. There are three such terms (hk, hl, kl), each contributing 2 cos 30. So 3 * 2 cos 30 = 6 * (√3/2 )= 3√3 ≈5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 +5.196 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d = 10 / 2.864 ≈ approximately 3.49 Angstroms? Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait a second, maybe I confused the formula. Because the standard formula I remember is:

d = (1/ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos gamma )) ) * ( a^2/(V) )^(1/2) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos gamma ) ) * (a^2 b^2 c^2 / (a^2 b^2 c^2))^(1/2) ), but I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, another approach: let me think of the structure factor or the unit cell vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, all equal in magnitude (a=10). The angles between each pair of vectors are 30 degrees. The vectors can be represented as:

a = (a, 0, 0)
b = (a cos α, a sin α, 0)
c = (a cos γ, (a/(cos α)) (sin γ - (cos γ cos α)/ sin α ), a (sqrt(1 - cos^2 γ - ( (sin γ cos α )/( sin α ) )^2 )) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the volume formula for the unit cell.

The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

Wait, but how does that help with the interplanar distance? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another formula I can use is for the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )) )^{-1/2} } * ... no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a general formula. The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ ) ) * (1/ a') )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the correct formula. Alternatively, let me think about the reciprocal space. The formula for d-spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1/√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me search my memory for the correct formula.

Oh! Wait, the correct formula for the interplanar distance (d) in any crystal system is:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + b^2 ( ... )) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ) ) ]^(1/2)

No, perhaps another approach: there's a formula that uses the reciprocal of the metric tensor. The metric tensor is defined as:

g = [ [ a², ab cos γ, ac cos β ],
       [ ab cos γ, b², bc cos α ],
       [ ac cos β, bc cos α, c² ] ]

For a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and angles are all equal, so the metric tensor becomes:

g = [ [ a², a² cos α, a² cos α ],
       [ a² cos α, a², a² cos α ],
       [ a² cos α, a² cos α, a² ] ]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor (g^{-1}) is used to compute the d-spacing. The formula for d_{hkl} is:

d² = 1 / (h² + k² + l² - 2 hk (cos α) - 2 hl (cos α) - 2 kl (cos α) )

Wait, but that would imply d = 1 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but that formula would give the reciprocal of a, because for a cubic system with a =1 and angles 90°, cos α =0. Then, the denominator becomes h² +k² +l², and d=1/sqrt(...), which would be correct for simple cubic.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the cubic case, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So if a=1, d=1/sqrt(...). So in that case, perhaps the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ )

But that's only when a = 1? Or wait, perhaps I need to include a scaling factor. Oh, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for d-spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

But this assumes that the lattice parameter 'a' is scaled such that a=1. But in our problem, a is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps I need to multiply by a?

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( ... )

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) / sqrt(...) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor, and then compute the reciprocal of the (hkl) plane to find d.

The metric tensor g for the rhombohedral system is:

g = a² [ 1       cos α   cos α ]
    [ cos α   1       cos α ]
    [ cos α   cos α   1    ]

Because a = b = c, and all angles are α.

The reciprocal tensor g^{-1} is needed to compute the d-spacing. The components of g^{-1} can be found, but it's a bit involved. The formula for g^{-1} in a rhombohedral system is known, but I can't recall it exactly.

Alternatively, the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]^{-1/2 }

Wait, that sounds promising. Because for a cubic system, cos 90=0, so it reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

In our case, a=10 Angstroms, h=k=l=1, and α=30 degrees.

So let's compute the denominator inside the sqrt:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

hk + hl + kl = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3.

So substituting:

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2 * (3) * cos(30°).

cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So:

Denominator = 3 + 2*3*(0.866) =3 + 6*0.866 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= sqrt(8.196)≈2.864.

Thus, d = a / sqrt(denominator) =10 / 2.864 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hold on, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe I confused a^2 with a. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But this is when a=1, so in our case, a=10, so d would be (10 Ang) / sqrt(...).

Wait, let's try that. So the denominator inside the sqrt is (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma )

Given h=k=l=1, and all angles alpha=30 degrees.

So h² +k² +l² =3.

The terms inside the cos: hk=1*1=1, hl=1*1=1, kl=1*1=1. So each term is cos(30), which is about 0.866.

So 2*(hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) = 2*(1*0.866 +1*0.866 +1*0.866 )=2*(2.598) =5.196.

So the denominator becomes 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, that's a negative number under the square root. That can't be possible. So I must have messed up the formula again.

Hmm, perhaps the formula should include a scaling factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is as follows:

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but that would be similar to what I did earlier. Let me try this. So using a=10, h=k=l=1, and cos α=0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= ~2.864.

So d=10 /2.864≈3.49.

But the options are higher, like 8.95, etc. So that suggests I'm way off.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to use a different approach. Maybe using the unit cell parameters and calculating the volume, then using the volume to compute interplanar distance.

Wait, the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1-3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha).

But I'm not sure how that ties into d-spacing.

Wait, another thought: the volume V is also equal to (a b c) / (sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )) )

But when a=b=c and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, it's V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 30 + 2 cos^3 30 )

Let me compute that.

cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So cos^2(30)= (3/4)=0.75.

cos^3(30)= (3√3)/8 ≈0.6495.

So V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ).

Compute inside the sqrt:

1 - 2.25 + 1.299 = (1 + (-2.25 +1.299)) = 1 -0.951= 0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)≈0.2215.

So V=10^3 * 0.2215 ≈2215 Ang^3.

But how does that help with d_{hkl}?

Hmm, perhaps I can compute the number of lattice points or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos alpha + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos gamma )) )^{-1/2} )

Wait, but in this case, a=10, and the angles are all 30 degrees. So for h=k=l=1, let's compute the denominator inside sqrt.

h^2 +k^2 + l^2 =3.

The 2hk cos alpha term is 2*(1)(1)*0.866 =1.732. Similarly for the other cross terms. So 3 cross terms, each 1.732, so 3*1.732=5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt: 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

Thus, d=10 /2.864≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are in the 9 range, so I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula and it's actually (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + ... )) )^{-1/2} ?

Wait, that would mean:

d = a / sqrt( ... )

Wait, no, let me think. If the formula is d = a / sqrt(...), then for a=10, that's 10 /2.864≈3.49, which I already did.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt(...), but that doesn't make sense because d should be smaller than a.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the Miller indices. The (111) plane implies h=1, k=1, l=1. But perhaps in rhombohedral systems, the indices have to be multiplied by some factor?

Wait, rhombohedral systems have a basis, maybe a two-atom basis leading to different reflections. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the reciprocal of the interatomic distance. No, interplanar distance is d, which is what the question is asking.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms in the lattice, which in a simple cubic structure would be a√3/2 for (111) planes? No, wait, in simple cubic, the (111) plane distance is a/sqrt(3). For interatomic distance, in BCC it's a√3/4, but I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing interplanar distance with the interatomic distance. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, which I assumed is the lattice parameter a. But perhaps in rhombohedral systems, the interatomic distance is along a different direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance d is given as 10 Angstroms, but the lattice parameter a is different. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is a√2 or something else.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, each atom at corner, the nearest neighbor distance is a√(1^2 +0+0 )=a. So for simple cubic, interatomic distance is a.

In a BCC structure, nearest neighbor is a*(√( (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 )) )=a√(3/4) = a√3/2.

Wait, but this is for cubic systems. For rhombohedral, which is a type of hexagonal close-packed? Not exactly, but perhaps the same approach applies.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are arranged in a primitive cubic lattice with a basis. So each atom is at (0,0,0) and (1/2,1/2,1/2). So the interatomic distance would be the distance between (0,0,0) and (1/2,1/2,1/2), which is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 )=a√3 /2.

So if the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, then 10= a√3/2 → a= 20/√3 ≈11.547 Angstroms.

Ah! That makes a big difference. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier by assuming the interatomic distance is a. Instead, the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in this case is a√3/2.

So given interatomic distance d_at =10= a√3/2 → a= 20/√3 ≈11.547 Angstroms.

Now, using this a value, let's compute the interplanar distance for (111) plane.

Using the formula: d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, so a is 20/√3.

h=k=l=1, alpha=30 degrees.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(3) * cos 30.

Which is 3 +6 * (√3/2 )=3 +3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d= (20/√3) / 2.864 → let's compute this.

First, 20/√3 ≈11.547.

11.547 /2.864 ≈4.03 Angstroms.

Wait, but that's still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But this would require a scaling factor.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g for rhombohedral is:

g = [ a²   a² cos α   a² cos α ]
    [ a² cos α   a²   a² cos α ]
    [ a² cos α   a² cos α   a² ]

The (111) plane corresponds to the reciprocal vector h=1, k=1, l=1.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The formula for d_{hkl} is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

But I'm not sure about the scaling here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = sqrt( ( g_11 (h)^2 + g_22 (k)^2 + g_33 (l)^2 ) ... )^-1 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the reciprocal of the (111) plane.

Wait, the formula for d is:

d = 1/√( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma )

But wait, I think this formula is in terms of the reciprocal lattice, and it's when a=1.

So, for a general a, the formula would be d = a / sqrt(...).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2hk cos alpha + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos gamma )) )^(-1/2 )

Wait, that's the same as earlier. So let's proceed.

So, a=20/√3 ≈11.547.

h=k=l=1.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6*(√3/2 )=3 +3√3 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

d= ( ( (20/√3)^2 ) * 8.196 )^(-1/2 )

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute d as:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6 cos 30 )

Which is (20/√3) / sqrt(8.196 )= (20/√3) / 2.864.

Wait, 20/√3 ≈11.547.

11.547 / 2.864≈4.03 Angstroms.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal.

Alternative approach: perhaps the interplanar distance formula is:

d = (1/(h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )) * (some function of a)

Wait, but I'm not getting it right.

Another approach: Perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d = (1/ sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos gamma )) ) * (a^2 / (something) )^(1/2 )

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = ( a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + b^2 ( ... ) + c^2(...) ) / ( ... ), but again, I'm getting stuck.

An alternative thought: since it's a rhombohedral system and all angles are 30 degrees, perhaps the (111) planes are similar to the (100) planes in some way. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure factor and the relation to interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the volume and use that in the formula. The volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha )

Which for a=20/√3 and alpha=30 degrees:

cos^2(alpha) = 3/4, cos^3=3√3/8.

So,

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8 )

= 1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4

= (4/4 -9/4) + (3√3)/4

= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + (1.3 )= 0.05.

So V= (20/√3)^3 * sqrt(0.05) )

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps I should look for a known formula or example.

Wait, I've found a formula online before which states that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk + 2hl + 2kl ) * sqrt(3)

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's when all angles are 60 degrees.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, the options are all around 9 Angstroms. If I compute 10/sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) )=10/√3≈5.77 Angstroms. Not matching.

Wait, but if a=10, and the formula I used earlier gives d=3.49. None of the options match that, so perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given (10 Angstrom) is the edge length a. So a=10.

Compute d using the formula I had before:

d= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 6 * cos 30 )

=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3√3 )

Which is 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/(2.864)≈3.49.

But options are higher. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a minute. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, let me compute that denominator.

3 - 2*(3)*cos(30) =3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

That's negative, which is impossible, so that can't be right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2hk cos alpha - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma )

But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so:

Denominator =3 -2*(1*1*0.866 +1*1*0.866 +1*1*0.866 )=3 -6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196.

Negative again, which is impossible.

So perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2hk cos alpha + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos gamma )

Which would be the same as the sum of the squares plus the cross terms, which would give the same denominator as before.

So, d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 Ang.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the angles? The question says alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, but maybe the angles are 60 degrees.

Wait, no, the question states 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not along the a-axis.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic vectors are along the edges of the unit cell. So the interatomic distance is a√(1 +1 +1 - 2(1 +1 +1) cos alpha ), assuming the atoms are at (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). Wait, that's for a basis of two atoms, perhaps.

Let me compute that. So, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) is sqrt( (a cos 0 )^2 + (a cos alpha)^2 + (a cos alpha)^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) in rhombohedral coordinates is:

x = a * (1) 

y = a cos gamma * (1) + a sin gamma * (1) 

z = ... wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the distance in terms of the three vectors.

The vectors a, b, c are:

a = (a, 0, 0)

b = (a cos alpha, a sin alpha, 0)

c = (a cos gamma, a ( sin gamma cos beta ), a ( sin gamma sin beta ) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) is sqrt( (a)^2 + (a cos alpha)^2 + (a cos alpha)^2 + 2(a)(a cos alpha)(cos alpha) + 2(a)(a cos alpha)(cos alpha) + 2(a cos alpha)(a cos alpha)(cos alpha) )

Wait, no, perhaps that's the expansion of (a + a cos alpha + a cos alpha )^2, but that seems incorrect.

Hmm, maybe this is getting too involved. I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should consider looking at the options and see which one fits.

Wait, another idea: if the interplanar distance d is 10 Angstroms, but the options are higher than what I calculated, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But that gave a negative denominator, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2hk cos alpha - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma )

But in that case, we get a negative, so perhaps the formula is the reciprocal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of d, but that doesn't make sense.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I'm missing a key formula, but I can't remember it correctly. Given that, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, if a=10 and the formula gives d=3.49, but none of the options are near that, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that a=10. Maybe the interatomic distance isn't along the a-axis.

Wait, interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So if the structure is a simple cubic, then a=10. But in rhombohedral, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√(1 +1 +1 - 2(1 +1 +1) cos alpha )

Wait, let me compute that. So for alpha=30 degrees,

distance^2 = a² ( 1 + 1 +1 - 2(1 +1 +1) cos 30 )

= a² (3 -6 * 0.866 )= a² (3 -5.196 )=a² (-2.196 )

Which is negative, which isn't possible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate the reciprocal of the d-spacing I found and see if it matches any option. But 3.49 is way lower than the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance for (111) is larger than a, but that doesn't make sense because in cubic systems, d for (111) is a/sqrt(3) which is less than a.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually:

d = sqrt( (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 )) ) / sqrt( ... )

I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, the options are around 9 Angstroms. So if I had a=10, and the denominator inside sqrt is about 1.111, then d=10/1.111≈9. So let's see:

Looking for sqrt( (3 + 6 cos 30 ))=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864, so 10/2.864≈3.49.

No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is 1.111, so 10/1.111≈9. So what would make sqrt( something )=1.111.

So something=1.234.

To get 1.234, perhaps:

h² +k² +l² ...: But 3 - 2*(3) cos alpha =3 -6*0.866=3-5.196=-2.196.

Negative, no.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal.

Wait, it's possible that the formula is d=1/ sqrt( ... ), which for the case when a=1 would give d=1/2.864≈0.349. But with a=10, it's 10*0.349≈3.49, which I already have.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to conclude that perhaps the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Angstrom, as it's approximately 10 divided by 1.116, which would mean the denominator inside the sqrt is around 1.116²≈1.245.

Wait, but I don't see how that would happen with the given parameters. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/√3 somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - alpha) )

Wait, but alpha is 30 degrees, so 180-30=150 degrees, cos(150)= -√3/2.

So then denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*3*(-√3/2 )=3 -3√3≈3-5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative. No go.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should just pick the option that is a=10 divided by approximately 1.111, which is 9. So option B is 8.95, which is close to 9.

Wait, but how? Let me see:

If the denominator inside the sqrt is approximately 1.111^2 ≈ 1.234.

So what would make (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )=1.234?

h^2 +k^2 +l^2 is 3. So 3 + 6 cos alpha=1.234 → 6 cos alpha= -1.766 → cos alpha≈-0.294, which is about 107 degrees. But the question says 30 degrees. So that can't be right.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've invested, I'll have to make a choice. Based on the options, I'll guess that the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Angstroms.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
- \( h = k = l = 1 \) (for the (111) plane),
- \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \),
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \).

The denominator inside the square root becomes:

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)
\]

\[
= 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866)
\]

\[
= 3 + 2(3 \cdot 0.866)
\]

\[
= 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

### Step 2: Calculating \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{8.196}}
\]

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}} \approx \frac{10}{2.864} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Reconciling with the options
The calculated value of \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests a potential misunderstanding of the interatomic distance. If the interatomic distance refers to the nearest-neighbor distance in the crystal, it may not directly correspond to the lattice parameter \( a \). For example, in a rhombohedral system, the nearest-neighbor distance could involve a different geometric relationship.

### Step 4: Adjusting for the nearest-neighbor distance
Assuming the interatomic distance corresponds to the nearest-neighbor distance, the lattice parameter \( a \) might need to be recalculated. For instance, if the interatomic distance is \( a \cdot \sqrt{3}/2 \), then:

\[
a = \frac{2 \cdot \text{interatomic distance}}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{2 \cdot 10}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 11.547 \, \text{Å}
\]

Using this adjusted \( a \), the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) would be recalculated. However, even with this adjustment, the resulting \( d_{111} \) remains inconsistent with the provided options.

### Step 5: Final consideration
Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the options, and the lack of clarity in the relationship between the interatomic distance and the lattice parameter, the most reasonable choice is to select the option closest to the expected range based on the given data. Among the options, \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \) (Option B) is the most plausible.
