Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the larger the parallax, the closer the star is because p = 1/d (where p is parallax and d is distance in parsecs I think).

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky—wait, does that mean uniformly in terms of distance or uniformly in some other way? I think it means that in space, the stars are spread out so that their density doesn't change with distance. Or maybe it's about the number per volume. So the number density n is constant.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So maybe I should think about how many stars fall into a certain range of parallax values. Parallax p is related to distance d as p = 1/d. So if d increases, p decreases.

Let me think about how to model this. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number per volume element should be the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a small volume dV around a point at distance d would be n * dV, where n is the number density.

But dV in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr, right? Because the volume of a thin shell at radius r is surface area (4πr²) multiplied by dr, the thickness of the shell.

So if the distance is d, then the volume element is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dd is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we're interested in parallax p. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So let's substitute d in terms of p. Also, when d changes by dd, p changes by dp. Let's see: since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, but since I'm dealing with the number of stars in a certain dp range, I need to relate dd and dp.

Wait, let me think. If d = 1/p, then p = 1/d. So when d increases, p decreases. So dd would be a small change in d, leading to a small change dp in p. Let's compute dp in terms of dd.

d = 1/p → p = 1/d → dp/dd = -1/d² → dp = -dd/(d²). Therefore, dd = -d² dp.

But since d is positive and we're considering small changes, the negative sign indicates that as d increases, p decreases, but when I integrate or compute the number, I can take absolute values.

So substituting d = 1/p into dd = -d² dp, we get dd = -(1/p²) dp. But since we're interested in the number of stars in a positive range dp, we'll take the absolute value, so dd ≈ (1/p²) dp.

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax p with thickness dp is N = n * 4π d² dd. Let's substitute d² and dd.

d = 1/p → d² = 1/p². And dd = (1/p²) dp.

So N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = n * 4π * (1/p^4) dp.

Which means the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so the number is N/(dp) = n *4π (1/p^4). So the number per unit parallax interval (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would be the case. So the answer should be A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density \( n \) of stars is constant.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd,
\]

where \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \) is the volume of the thin shell. Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we find \( d^2 = \frac{1}{p^2} \). Additionally, the change in distance \( dd \) relates to the change in parallax \( dp \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Taking the absolute value, \( dd = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \).

Substituting \( d^2 = \frac{1}{p^2} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \, dp = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This matches option A.
