Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given info is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, radius of Star_1 (R1) is 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But then, the question is about their luminosities. 

Wait, but then they mention that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1_max = λ2_max implies T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Okay, so both stars have the same temperature. Now, the next part is about radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, right? So if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so it's not moving relative to us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but if the observed wavelengths are already considered, does that affect the calculation? Hmm, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, perhaps the emission peaks are measured as the same when considering their velocities? Or maybe the question is about their rest frame emission. Hmm, I might be overcomplicating this.

But wait, the problem says the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe it's the observed wavelength. But if Star_2 is moving, its peak wavelength would be shifted. But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps we can ignore the Doppler effect here because the observed λ_max is same, implying that any Doppler shift is accounted for in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is more straightforward: since the stars' peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures are the same. So the velocity part might not directly affect the luminosity calculation, except maybe through some other factor. Or perhaps the velocities are a red herring here, and I can ignore them for the purpose of calculating luminosities. Because the question is about the luminosity ratio, which is based on radius and temperature, and perhaps the mass is a distractor.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is about what that factor is. So I probably don't need to worry about the velocities for this part. Let's focus on the luminosity.

Luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T (because λ_max same → same T), the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1²/R2²) * (T1⁴/T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, then (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So that would suggest the answer is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and one of the options is around 2.23 or 2.32. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the mass is also given as 1.5 times larger for Star_1. Does mass relate to luminosity? Well, for main-sequence stars, mass and luminosity are related, but I don't think that's relevant here because the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. So the mass might not directly affect the luminosity calculation if we're using the black body formula. But wait, if the stars have the same temperature, but different masses, how does that affect anything? Hmm, perhaps mass is a distractor here, and the problem is simply about the blackbody formula, so I can ignore the mass.

Wait, but wait another thing: stars don't always behave perfectly as blackbodies, but the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so I should proceed with that assumption.

So, going back: if the temperature is the same for both stars and the radii are 1.5 times, then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer should be option A, ~2.25.

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So why is there a discrepancy? Did I miss some factor?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed flux or the observed luminosity? Because Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is Doppler shifted. But since the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same, that might imply that any Doppler shift is corrected, and the temperature is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the luminosity calculation doesn't account for the Doppler shift, but the observed flux does. Wait, but the question is about the computed luminosity, not the observed flux. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the Doppler effect on the flux. Let me think: the observed flux (F) is related to the intrinsic luminosity (L) via F = L / (4πd²), where d is the distance. But the question is not about flux; it's about luminosity, so perhaps the Doppler effect affects how we calculate the luminosity from the observed data. Let me try to think.

Wait, when a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, but the peak wavelength is shorter. But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. That implies that the Doppler effect has shifted the wavelengths so that their observed λ_max is the same. So perhaps the temperatures we calculate from the observed data are different, but the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures in the rest frame must be the same.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let's think: if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength would be blueshifted. So to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1 which isn't moving, Star_2 must have a higher temperature in its rest frame. Because λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (c + v) / (c - v) ) ) approximately. Wait, no, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the velocity away. Wait, if a star is moving towards us, v is negative. So the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest frame.

Wait, let's model this. Let’s denote Star_1 as S1 and Star_2 as S2.

For S1: v = 0 → λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For S2: v = 700 km/s towards us? Wait, radial velocity is 700 km/s. The problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." Wait, radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. So Star_1 has zero, Star_2 has 700 km/s. If the velocity is positive when moving away, then Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So according to Doppler effect, its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). But the problem says that the observed λ_max are the same. So for S2, which is moving away, the observed λ_max would be longer. But S1's λ_max is at λ1_rest. So for their observed λ_max to be same, S2's rest frame λ_rest must be shorter than S1's. Because when you redshift λ_rest, you get a longer λ_obs. So if λ_obs is same as S1, then S2's λ_rest must be smaller than S1's. Which would mean that S2's temperature is higher than S1's, because λ_rest is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, that complicates things. Because earlier I thought that T1 = T2 because λ_obs is same. But if the stars are moving, their rest frame λ_rest could be different, leading to same observed λ_obs.

So maybe the initial assumption that T1 = T2 is incorrect. Hmm. So perhaps the stars have different rest-frame temperatures, but when observed, their λ_max are the same. So the temperatures are not the same. So we need to factor in the Doppler shift to find their rest temperatures.

Let me think again. The observed wavelength from each star is the same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Assuming non-relativistic speeds (700 km/s is about 0.0023c, so non-relativistic Doppler shift approximation applies).

Doppler shift formula for wavelength (approximate for small v/c):

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)

But wait, the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), when moving away. Wait, but when moving away, v is positive. So for S2, which is moving away at v =700 km/s, the observed wavelength would be longer. So λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c) [approximated].

For S1, which is at rest, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

The problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c)

But also, the rest wavelengths are related to their temperatures via Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)

Wait, no wait, let me re-arrange:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c)

But λ_rest1 = b/T1 and λ_rest2 = b/T2.

So:

b/(T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)

Alternatively,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

Wait, that's the opposite. Let me double-check:

Assume v is the velocity of S2 away from us. So for S2, λ_obs = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c).

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, and λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c)

But λ_rest is also b/T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v/c)

Canceling b,

1/T1 = (1 + v/c) / T2

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So the temperature of S2 is higher than S1.

Wait, so T2 is greater than T1 because S2 is moving away, making its observed wavelength the same as S1. So S2 is hotter in its rest frame. So T2 = T1*(1 + v/c).

But wait, let me compute v in terms of c. 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. c is ~3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333... So v/c is about 0.00233.

So (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.00233.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

Hmm, so the temperature of S2 is a bit higher than S1.

Now, considering the luminosity formula: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

Wait, no, R1 is 1.5 R of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

Wait, R1 = 1.5 R2 → R2 = R1 / 1.5.

But perhaps it's better to express both R and T in terms of T1 and R1.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's write:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

We need to find L1/L2.

Substituting R2 = R1 / 1.5, and T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So,

L2 = 4π (R1/1.5)^2 σ [ T1 (1 + v/c) ]^4

= 4π R1² σ T1^4 * (1/(1.5)^2) * (1 + v/c)^4

Similarly, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

So,

L1/L2 = [4π R1² σ T1^4 ] / [4π R1^2 σ T1^4 * (1/(1.5)^2) * (1 + v/c)^4 ]

Simplify:

The 4π R1² σ T1^4 terms cancel, so:

L1/L2 = 1 / [ (1/(1.5)^2) * (1 + v/c)^4 ) ]

Which is the same as:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 / (1 + v/c)^4

Compute the denominator:

(1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4

We can approximate this using the binomial expansion. (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x², for small x.

Here x = 0.002333, n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.002333 + (4 * 3/2) * (0.002333)^2

Compute each term:

4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332

Second term: (12/2) * (0.002333)^2 = 6 * (5.44e-6) ≈ 3.264e-5

So total ≈ 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003264 ≈ 1.009365.

But wait, is that precise enough? Let me compute 1.002333^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, compute (1.002333)^2 first.

(1.002333)^2 = approximately 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Then square that result to get the fourth power:

(1.00467144)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182 ≈ 1.0093647.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093647.

So denominator is approx 1.0093647.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ let's compute this.

2.25 ÷ 1.00936 → Let's see, 1.00936 is approximately 1 + 0.00936. So 1/1.00936 ≈ 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

So the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.227, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

But wait, option C is ~2.35, which is higher, so perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the math.

Wait, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T2 / T1)^4.

Because L is proportional to R² T⁴.

From earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So T2/T1 = (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T2/T1)^4.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4)/(R2² T2^4).

But R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T2 = T1*(1 + v/c) → T2/T1 = 1 + v/c → (T2/T1)^4 = (1 + v/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1 + v/c)^4.

Wait, no, I think I mixed up the ratio. Let's compute again.

Wait, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 ) ) = (1.5^2) * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

Since T2 = T1*(1 + v/c ), so T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c ).

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * ( (1/(1.002333) )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.0093647) )

≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

So the ratio is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So that's the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be 2.25, but considering the Doppler effect, it's a bit less. So the correct factor is about 2.23, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their radii and temperatures, while accounting for the Doppler effect due to their radial velocities. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Luminosity Formula**: The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]

2. **Given Data**:  
   - \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\)  
   - Radial velocities: \(v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)  
   - Observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same for both stars.

3. **Wien's Law and Doppler Effect**:  
   From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}\), where \(\lambda_{\text{rest}}\) is the rest-frame wavelength and \(T\) is the temperature. The observed wavelength is related to the rest-frame wavelength by the Doppler effect:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]  
   Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)), the rest-frame temperatures are related by:  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot \frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}
   \]  
   For \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v/c \approx 0.002333\), so:  
   \[
   T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio Calculation**:  
   Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333\) into the luminosity ratio formula:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (1.002333)^{-4}
   \]  
   Using the approximation \((1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00936\):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \(2.23\) times greater than that of Star_2. This corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
