Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed to move the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is made up of atoms X and Y with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that means it's in the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. But I'm a bit confused about what "next state with the lowest possible energy" refers to. Does that mean the next higher energy state overall, considering both rotation and vibration?

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. But I'm not entirely sure how these combine. Oh right, the energy levels are quantized in both modes, and the total energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). Wait, but for a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (v), where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0 is the ground state).

Wait, no, the vibrational energy is actually given by the formula E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So for v=0, it's (0 + 1/2) h w, which is the zero-point energy.

But the molecule is in the fundamental state, so v=0 and J=0. So the total energy is E = E_vib (v=0) + E_rot (J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the first excited state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), whichever requires less energy. But wait, photons have quantized energy, so the absorbed photon must provide exactly the energy difference between these states.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next possible states are either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy? Let me calculate the energies.

The vibrational energy for v=1 is (1 + 1/2) h w = 3/2 h w, which is 3/2 * h * 4e14. The rotational energy for J=1 is B*(1+1) = 2B. So I need to find which of these is lower.

Wait, I should calculate the values.

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference from v=0 to v=1. The energy change ΔE_vib = E_vib(v=1) - E_vib(v=0) = (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

Similarly, the rotational energy from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (2B - 0) = 2B. So the energy needed for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

So which is smaller between h w and 2B? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference. The photon's energy is E_photon = h f = h w (since the frequency is given as w/(2π) → no, wait, angular frequency ω is 2π f, so f = ω/(2π). Hmm, wait the given w is 4e14 rad/s, so f = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz. So E_photon = h * f = 6.626e-34 J*s * 6.37e13 Hz ≈ 4.23e-20 J.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Because the molecule is in the ground state, and we're looking for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is the smallest possible energy increase. So between the two possibilities (vibrational or rotational), which requires less energy.

But wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational motions. So perhaps the molecule isn't a rigid rotor but a non-rigid one, so the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state as well. Oh right, because in a non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, so the moment of inertia isn't constant. But I'm not exactly sure how that affects the calculation here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only the rigid rotor model, which assumes the bond length is fixed.

Let me think about the rotational constant B. B is given by ħ² / (2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu. Wait, 20 + 2 is 22, so 20*2=40/22 is 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert that to kilograms. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.206e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.412e-46) ) ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, but I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck:

B = (ħ²) / (2 * I )

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s

ħ squared: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 = about 1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.206e-46 kg m².

So 2I = 2.412e-46.

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.412e-46) = approx (1.112 / 2.412) * 1e-22.

1.112/2.412 is about 0.461, so 0.461e-22 J, which is 4.61e-23 J.

So the rotational energy ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 * 4.61e-23 = 9.22e-23 J.

The vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is h w, where w is given as 4e14 rad/s. Wait, but E_photon is h f, and f = w/(2π). So ΔE_vib = h * (w/(2π)) ) = h * (4e14)/(2π) = (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.626e-34 * 6.368e13 ≈ 4.23e-20 J.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 4e14 / (2π) is approximately 4e14 / 6.283 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon_vib = h f = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.23e-20 J.

Comparing ΔE_rot (9.22e-23 J) and ΔE_vib (4.23e-20 J), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon with the lower energy would be the one causing a rotational transition. But wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. Does that mean that both v and J are at their lowest, which is zero? So to go to the next state, the molecule can either increase v by 1, or J by 1.

But the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that requires the least energy. Since ΔE_rot (9.22e-23 J) is much less than ΔE_vib (4.23e-20 J), the photon should have an energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, no, because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these two has lower energy?

Wait, let me compute the energies.

E_total for v=0, J=0: E_vib (0) + E_rot (0) = (1/2) h w + 0 = 0.5 h w.

For v=1, J=0: E_vib (1) + E_rot (0) = (3/2) h w.

For v=0, J=1: E_vib (0) + E_rot (1) = 0.5 h w + 2B.

So the energy differences are:

v=1, J=0: (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w = 4.23e-20 J.

v=0, J=1: (0.5 h w + 2B) - 0.5 h w = 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

So the transition to J=1 is much lower in energy than the transition to v=1. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is J=1, v=0.

So the photon's energy must match the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, which is 2B.

So the energy of the photon is 2B.

But wait, wait. The question is about the momentum of the photon. Since the photon's energy is E = h f = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. Wait, no, the relation is E = p c for photons, but actually, p = E/(c), since for a photon, E = pc. So p = E_photon / c.

So the energy of the photon is E = 2B. So p = (2B) / c.

Wait, no, correction: E = h f = p c → p = E / c.

So we need to calculate the photon's momentum as (2B) / c.

Wait, but wait. Is the energy of the photon exactly 2B? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference. So yes, in this case, the energy needed is 2B.

So let's compute this.

First, 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

Speed of light c = 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are in the range of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Wait, 1 Ns is kg m/s. So 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns. But the options are higher than that. Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated B. Let me go back through the calculations.

Let me recompute B.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is h/(2π) = 6.626e-34 / (6.283) ≈ 1.054e-33 J s.

So ħ² = (1.054e-33)^2 ≈ 1.111e-66 J² s².

B = ħ² / (2 I) = (1.111e-66) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) ) = (1.111e-66) / (2.4128e-46) ) ≈ 4.607e-21 J.

Wait, that's a different value. Earlier I thought B was 4.61e-23 J, but now it's 4.6e-21 J. Oh wait, what did I do wrong earlier.

Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s, so ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s². Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me correct that.

Ah, I think I messed up the calculation of ħ squared. Let me compute it correctly:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s
ħ^2 = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ) ≈ (1.112 / 2.4128) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.4128 ≈ 0.461, so B ≈ 0.461e-22 J = 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, that's what I originally had. So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

So the energy of the photon is 9.22e-23 J.

Now, p = E / c = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.22e-23) / (3e8) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is much larger than 3e-31.

Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. B is given by (ħ²)/(2I), but I think that's correct.

Wait, let me recompute I. I = μ r².

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So B = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) )

Wait, (1.05457e-34)^2 is 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = approx 4.61e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

So p = E / c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So none of the options match this. That suggests I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning not just rotationally but vibrationally. Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong transition.

Wait, maybe the question is about the next state, which could involve both a rotational and vibrational transition. But that might require more energy than just a single transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model isn't the rigid rotor but the non-rigid rotor, which complicates things. But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but in the lowest rotational state (J=0). To get to the next state, which is the first higher energy state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy, which is either J=1 or v=1.

Wait, but earlier I saw that the energy required for J=1 is about 9.22e-23 J, and for v=1, 4.23e-20 J. So the J=1 transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy must be 2B, which is 9.22e-23 J.

But the options are much bigger. So perhaps I'm miscalculating B.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational energy contribution. The molecule is in v=0, so the next state could involve a vibrational transition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the fundamental state as the first excited state of either rotation or vibration. But no, the fundamental state is the ground state.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next state as the first state in the spectrum, which would be a combination of rotational and vibrational transitions. But that's probably more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, and the transition requires the photon to supply both the vibrational and rotational energy. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: The energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. The ground state is E = (1/2) h w + 0 (since J=0). The next state would be the lowest energy state which is higher. But the states are labeled in order of increasing energy.

So the next state after (v=0, J=0) could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0), whichever has lower energy.

Earlier, I found that (v=0, J=1) has lower energy than (v=1, J=0), so the photon must have energy equal to the difference between (v=0, J=1) and (v=0, J=0), which is 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B, leading to momentum p = (2B)/c.

But as I calculated, this gives p ≈3e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps the formula for B is different. Let me think. Oh wait, sometimes B is expressed in terms of wavenumbers, but here I've calculated it in J. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of cm^-1, but that might not help here.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both a change in vibration and rotation, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total energy, including both rotational and vibrational contributions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule transitions from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require a photon with energy h w.

So the energy of the photon is h w, which is 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is close but not exact. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h w.

Wait, let me recompute h w accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

So E = h * w = 6.62607e-34 * 4e14 = 2.650428e-19 J.

p = 2.650428e-19 J / (3e8 m/s) = 8.83476e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28, but that's about half of our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which implies v=0. So the photon must have energy enough for the transition to the next state, which could be either the first rotational or vibrational state. But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy.

But in our earlier calculation, the rotational transition's photon energy is 9.22e-23 J, which would lead to momentum 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from J=0 to J=1, but in the same vibrational state v=0. But that would require a photon with energy 2B, which is 9.22e-23 J, giving p≈3e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next level in energy, which might be a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vibrational transition only. Because the question states that the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state with the lowest possible energy would be v=1, J=0. Because the energy required for J=1 is about 9e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition's 4e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would have energy 2B.

But this leads to a momentum of about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia I. Let me recheck that.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms → 2e-10 meters.

I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46) → let me compute this again.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = (1.112 / 2.4128) ) * 1e-22 → approx 0.461 * 1e-22 = 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s → 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

Still not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require more energy, so that's not the lowest next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon causing a vibrational transition, which requires a higher energy, leading to a larger momentum than the rotational transition. But in that case, the momentum would be about 8.8e-28 Ns, which is option D (1.4e-28) is about a quarter of that.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in the ground state and the next state is the first vibrational state, but perhaps the mass is treated differently. Or maybe the reduced mass is not calculated correctly.

Wait, another thought: the formula for B is (ħ²)/(2 I μ?), no, I think it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rigid rotor model, but I've done that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels aren't simply additive, but there's a coupling between rotation and vibration. In that case, the energy levels might be more complex.

But I'm not familiar with the exact form of the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. Maybe the energy transitions involve both vibrational and rotational changes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which would involve a change in both vibration and rotation. But that's more complicated and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the total energy as E = E_vib + E_rot, and the next state is the first state with higher energy, which could be either rotational or vibrational. But I thought earlier that the rotational transition requires less energy.

But according to the options, none of them match the rotational transition. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the photon's energy as h w, which is 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of this. Option C is 1.1e-27, which is much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the w calculation. Let me check the given w.

Problem states w is 4e14 rad/s. So E = h w? Or is it E = h * (w/(2π))?

Wait, no, because E = h f, and f = w/(2π). So E = h w/(2π).

So E_photon = (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (2π) → 6.626e-34 * 4e14 / 6.283 ≈ (2.65e-19) / 6.283 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

So p = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg m/s = 1.407e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D: 1.4e-28 N*s.

Oh! So I think I see where I went wrong earlier. I forgot that E = h f, and f = w/(2π), not E = h w. So I should have used f = w/(2π) in the calculation.

So the correct energy of the photon is h * (w/(2π)).

So E_photon = 6.626e-34 * (4e14) / (2 * 3.1416) ) → approximately 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = 4.23e-20 J.

Then, p = E_photon / c = 4.23e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.41e-28 kg m/s → 1.41e-28 N s.

Which is very close to option D: 1.4e-28 N*s.

So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of a photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the ground state, where both the vibrational quantum number \(v = 0\) and the rotational quantum number \(J = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy could be either \(v = 1, J = 0\) (vibrational transition) or \(v = 0, J = 1\) (rotational transition). The energy required for these transitions is calculated as follows:

### Key Parameters:
- **Masses**: \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\)
- **Bond length**: \(r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)
- **Angular frequency**: \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)
- **Reduced mass**: \(\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}\)
- \(\mu\) in kilograms: \(\mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)

### Moment of Inertia:
\[
I = \mu r^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
\]

### Rotational Constant:
\[
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}
\]
\[
B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.206 \times 10^{-46}} = \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{2.412 \times 10^{-46}} = 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

### Energy for Rotational Transition:
The energy difference for a transition from \(J = 0\) to \(J = 1\) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.61 \times 10^{-23} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

### Energy for Vibrational Transition:
The energy difference for a transition from \(v = 0\) to \(v = 1\) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \cdot \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison of Energies:
- \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)
- \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)

The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. Therefore, the photon must have an energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

### Momentum of the Photon:
The energy of the photon is related to its momentum by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
\]

### Revisiting the Vibrational Transition:
If the question instead refers to the vibrational transition, the energy of the photon is:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = h \cdot \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} = 4.23 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
\]
The corresponding momentum is:
\[
p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{4.23 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated momentum for the vibrational transition is **D) \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}\)**.

Answer: D
