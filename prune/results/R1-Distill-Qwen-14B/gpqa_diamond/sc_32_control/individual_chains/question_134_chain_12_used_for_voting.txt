Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when a bunch of different solutions are mixed. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. I remember that the neutralization reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy change should be negative.

The problem gives three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to figure out how much each contributes and then sum it up. Wait, but I think that only the strongest acids and bases will react. Since HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is also strong (but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, so the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but for neutralization, we can consider both protons). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it should dissociate completely.

So the first step is to determine the moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution. Because when they're mixed, the H+ ions will react with OH- ions to form water. The total heat released would depend on the moles of H+ and OH- available, but I need to find out which is the limiting reactant.

Wait, I think the process is to calculate moles of H+ from the acids and moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess. The neutralization depends on the minimum of the two, so the other (excess) ions might not react, but wait, in this case, the problem might just consider the neutralization up to the limiting reagent.

So let's break it down.

First, calculate the moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity x Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, and since it's strong, the first H+ dissociates completely. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. Wait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 in solution usually donates two H+ ions, but in dilute solutions, the first dissociation is complete, and the second is only partial. However, for the purpose of calculating neutralization, I think we can take both H+ ions as available since the problem is about mixing the solutions, and the reaction would proceed until completion.

So for H2SO4, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+ ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, is the second H+ fully available? Hmm, if the solution is concentrated, maybe not. But in the problem, since it's just mixing, I think we can assume the maximum possible H+ from H2SO4. So 0.18 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is the base. How much OH- does it contribute? Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

Volume of Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from base: 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. The limiting reagent here is OH-, which is 0.2 moles. Because we have 0.28 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, the OH- will be used up, and some H+ will remain.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the OH- is 0.2 moles, and H+ is 0.28. So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, and the OH- is all consumed.

But wait, in the case of H2SO4, since it's diprotic, perhaps the first H+ is fully available, but the second might not react if OH- is limited. But since we're considering all H+ available, the calculation would proceed as before.

So, the amount of H+ reacting is 0.2 moles (equal to the OH-). So the neutralization involves 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases a certain amount of heat. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, I have to be careful with the units in the options. Let me think: the options are in kcal and kJ, so I need to know the value in those units.

Wait, 1 cal is about 4.184 J. 1 kcal is 1000 cal, so 4184 J. 1 kJ is 1000 J. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57,000 J divided by 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.6). So each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ or 13.6 kcal.

So the total enthalpy change would be moles of H+ reacting multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

In this case, 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, let me check the options again. Options are: A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, so our calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is about -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11,420 J or -11.42 kcal.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the conversion.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So each mole of H+ contributes to that. So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So that's approximately -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different value, perhaps 40 kJ per mole, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me think about the exact value of the enthalpy of neutralization. I remember that for strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy change is usually around -57 kJ per mole of acid. So HCl and NaOH, for example, give about -57 kJ per mole.

But in this case, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole gives two moles of H+. So when we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4, it contributes 0.18 moles of H+. However, when it comes to neutralization, each mole of H+ would contribute to the enthalpy.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ available is 0.28 moles, but only 0.2 moles of OH- are present. So the reaction can only proceed for 0.2 moles of H+.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, so maybe I'm supposed to calculate in kcal instead of kJ.

Wait, let me check. 57 kJ is equal to about 13.66 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 57 /4.184 ≈13.6). So 0.2 moles × 13.6 kcal/mol = 2.72 kcal. Wait, no, wait. Wait that can't be right. Let me compute 57 kJ = how many kcal?

Wait, 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal (since 1 kcal=4.184 kJ → 1 kJ = 1/4.184 ≈0.239 kcal).

So 57 kJ × 0.239 kcal/kJ ≈57 * 0.239 ≈13.6 kJ → 13.6 kcal?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal. So 57 kJ = ~13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. If I'm calculating using kcal/mol, then each mole releases 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would release 2.72 kcal. So the total would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But that contradicts my earlier calculation in kJ. So why is the answer varying based on units?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the molarity and volume to find the moles of H+ and OH-, and then calculate the heat based on the amount that reacts.

Wait, let me try this again.

Calculate moles of H+:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Moles of OH-:

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 mol), so 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

Each mole of H+ contributes about -57 kJ, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is given per mole of reaction as written. Wait, the neutralization reaction for each acid and base might have a different enthalpy. For example, HCl is a monoprotic acid, H2SO4 is diprotic.

Wait, perhaps each mole of H2SO4 contributes two moles of H+ and thus two times the enthalpy. So maybe the enthalpy is calculated per mole of H+.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to compute the total H+ and OH- available, find the limiting, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

So, if the limiting is OH- 0.2 moles, then 0.2 moles of H+ react. Each mole gives off 57 kJ, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → approximately -11.4 kJ.

Wait, no, because 11.4 kJ is equal to about 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.2 kJ, which doesn't fit.

Wait, let me do the exact calculation.

57 kJ per mole H+ → 0.2 moles → 11.4 kJ.

Convert 11.4 kJ to kcal: 11.4 kJ * (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is equivalent to -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another thought: is the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid or per mole of H+?

Wait, no, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of acid, but for diprotic acids, it's per mole of H+.

Wait, for HCl, which is monoprotic, each mole gives one mole, so 57 kJ per mole.

For H2SO4, which is diprotic, each mole gives two moles of H+, so 114 kJ per mole of H2SO4, but that's 57 kJ per H+.

So in our calculation, we correctly accounted for both H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, but when we calculated the moles of H+, we did it correctly. So the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, leading to 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

So in kcal, that's 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for enthalpy of neutralization. Some textbooks use -57 kJ per mole of acid, so for HCl, 1 mole releases -57 kJ, but for H2SO4, since it's diprotic, each mole would release -114 kJ. But wait, no, because that would double the enthalpy. But the way the neutralization works is per mole of H+ regardless of the acid.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the total moles of H+ from all sources and then multiply by the enthalpy per mole. But in that case, the limiting reagent would determine how much actually reacts.

So, the reaction can only proceed for the minimum of H+ and OH-.

H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles react.

So, 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be option A.

But wait, looking again at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps the value used is 57.1 kJ/mol, which would make 0.2 ×57.1 = 11.42 kJ, which is about 2.73 kcal. But that's not matching any options exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the heat released based on the moles without considering which is the limiting reagent. But that would be incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol. OH- = 0.2 mol.

So the OH- is limiting, so 0.2 mol H+ reacts.

So, 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be if the enthalpy per mole was 57.1 kJ, and 0.2 *57.1 is 11.42 kJ, which is about 2.73 kcal. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry correctly. The neutralization reaction for H2SO4 is H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O. So each mole of H2SO4 requires 2 moles of NaOH. But in this problem, the base is Ba(OH)2, which gives 2 OH- per formula unit.

Wait, but regardless of the base, the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ neutralizes one mole of OH-.

So I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the total moles of H+ and OH- without considering stoichiometry, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should check the molarity and volume again.

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M → 0.5 L ×0.2 mol/L=0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M → 0.3 L ×0.3=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M → 0.2 L ×0.5=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

Yes, the numbers are correct.

So the answer should be -2.72 kcal (option A) if using 57 kJ per mole H+.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem expects the sum of all H+ and OH- to determine the total reaction, but that would be incorrect because of the limiting reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and see if it's more than OH-.

In that case, the H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So only 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So -2.72 kcal is the answer, option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Maybe I'm using the wrong enthalpy value. Maybe the question uses a different value, like 80 kJ per mole.

Wait, 0.2 × 80 =16 kJ → which is option D.

But why would they use 80 kJ? Maybe I'm supposed to consider the stoichiometry differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the neutralization for each acid and base combination separately.

Wait, but the problem says all three are mixed, so they all neutralize each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the H+ from HCl and H2SO4, but also considering that H+ from H2SO4 may have two H+ per molecule.

Wait, but I don't think that changes the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 moles of OH-, and the H+ is 0.28, so the reaction is 0.2 moles, so the heat is 0.2 × 57 =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A.

But the problem is that the option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.2 kJ. That's way higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total heat released considering all H+ and all OH-, but that's not possible because OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the neutralization reaction's stoichiometry. For H2SO4, perhaps it's considering only the first H+ because the second isn't neutralized. So in that case, the H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 ×1 =0.09. Then total H+ would be 0.1 + 0.09 =0.19. OH- is 0.2. So the H+ is now the limiting reagent with 0.19, so 0.19 ×57 kJ =10.83 kJ → ≈ 2.58 kcal. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps all the H+ from H2SO4 is considered, so 0.18.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the heat released by each neutralization and sum them.

But that complicates things. Let me think:

HCl and Ba(OH)2: HCl is monoprotic, so each mole of HCl neutralizes one mole of Ba(OH)2 (but Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-). Wait, but neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of HCl provides 1 H+, which needs 1 OH-.

Similarly, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, each needing 1 OH-.

So, for HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → requires 0.1 OH-.

H2SO4: 0.18 mol H+ → requires 0.18 OH-.

Total needed OH-: 0.28 mol. But available OH- is 0.2 mol.

So, the amount of OH- is less than needed, so OH- is the limiting reagent.

So, all 0.2 moles of OH- will be used, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

So, 0.2 moles H+ → from HCl: up to 0.1 mol, and the remaining 0.1 from H2SO4.

So, the heat is 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ → 2.72 kcal. So option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl (monoprotic):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \).  
     H⁺ is available in excess (0.28 mol), while OH⁻ is limiting (0.2 mol).  
     Therefore, 0.2 moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ will react.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - For 0.2 moles of H⁺ reacting:  
     \( \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Match the result to the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
