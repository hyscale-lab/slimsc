Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how a planet would affect its brightness compared to some spots on the star. Hmm, okay. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They're saying that the photometric observations show periodic brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into our view. But the interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet. So we need to find the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Wait, the question is asking: to produce the same amplitude in the light curve without the spots, what's the planet-to-star radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar)?

So, first, I think I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then find what planet radius would cause the same dip.

But wait, when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is πRpl² / πRstar², so (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So the amplitude of the dip (delta) is approximately (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But in this case, the spots are causing a variation. So I need to compute the variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the planet's effect.

So, the spots are cooler than the surrounding star. So when the star rotates so that a spot comes into view, the star's overall brightness decreases because that area is emitting less light. The amount of the decrease depends on the area of the spot and how much cooler it is.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots. Wait, but one hemisphere is covered. Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. Hmm, so the entire hemisphere (which is half the star's surface) has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spot area is 0.2 * (πR²/2), wait no, the star's total surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of the hemisphere is spots, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, let me think again. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that is covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 2πr², and the filling factor is 0.2, then the spot area is 0.2 * 2πr² = 0.4 π r².

But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away as the star spins. So the total variation is when the spots are fully visible (maximum effect) and when they're not, but since it's one hemisphere, maybe it's more complicated.

Wait, but when the star's rotation brings the spotted hemisphere towards us, the spots will block light, causing a dip. The brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. The amplitude of the variation would be the difference in flux between when the spots are facing us and when they're not.

Wait, the star emits a certain amount of flux. When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced because the spots are cooler. The flux from the star is proportional to the surface area times the emission per unit area. The emission per unit area is sigma * Teff^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the total flux from the star without any spots would be F = sigma * Teff^4 * (4πR²) → but when the spots are present, the flux is F = sigma*Teff^4*(4πR² - A_spot) + sigma*T_spot^4*A_spot.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so their emission is less. So the total flux when spots are visible is F = (sigma * Teff^4) (4πR² - A_spot) ) + (sigma T_spot^4) * A_spot.

So the relative change in flux (delta F / F) would be:

delta F = F_spot_visible - F_clean
Wait, no. F_clean is when no spots are visible (spots are on the far side). When spots are visible, F is F_clean - (F_clean_spot - F_spot). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the difference between when the spots are visible and when they are not.

Wait, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux. Or is it the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not? Since the star is rotating, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the maximum flux is when the spots aren't visible (all the star's surface emits at Teff), and the minimum is when the spots are visible (some area emits at a lower temperature).

Wait, but wait, when the star is rotating, the spots that are on the near side will cause a decrease in flux because they're not emitting as much as the rest of the star. So the variation is the difference between when the spots are visible (lower flux) and when they're not (higher flux). The amplitude is the change in flux, which is the maximum minus the minimum.

So, let's compute the initial flux when no spots are visible (F1), and when the spots are visible (F2).

F1 = sigma * Teff^4 * 4π R².

F2 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4π R² - A_spot) + sigma * T_spot^4 * A_spot.

So delta F = F1 - F2 = sigma Teff^4 * A_spot - sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * A_spot.

Wait, let me recompute F2:

F2 = (sigma Teff^4) * (4π R² - A_spot) + (sigma T_spot^4) * A_spot.

Which can be rewritten as sigma * [Teff^4 (4π R² - A_spot) + T_spot^4 A_spot ].

So F1 is sigma Teff^4 *4π R².

So delta F = F1 - F2 = sigma Teff^4 (4π R²) - [ sigma Teff^4 (4π R² - A_spot) + sigma T_spot^4 A_spot ]

= sigma Teff^4 * A_spot - sigma T_spot^4 A_spot.

Factor out sigma A_spot:

delta F = sigma A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the relative change in flux is (delta F) / F1 = [ sigma A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ sigma Teff^4 4 π R² ]

The sigma cancels, so:

(delta F / F1) = [ A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 )

Now, the amplitude of the brightness variation is this relative change. So the amplitude is (delta F / F1) = [ A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 )

But wait, A_spot is the area of the spots. The star's surface area is 4 π R². So A_spot = (filling factor) * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2 π R²) ) = 0.4 π R².

So substituting A_spot = 0.4 π R².

So delta F / F1 = (0.4 π R²) * (6000^4 - 5000^4) / (4 π R² * 6000^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The R² cancels, as does the π. So:

0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 )

Simplify 0.4/4 = 0.1.

So delta F / F1 = 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4

Compute the terms:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1296e12 - 625e12 = 671e12.

So delta F / F1 = 0.1 * (671e12) / (1296e12) )

The e12 cancels. So 671 / 1296 ≈ 0.5178.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.05178.

So the amplitude is approximately 5.18%.

Wait, but wait. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spots are on the side facing us for half the rotation period. So the brightness variation is when the spots are entering and exiting the view. The maximum dip would be when the full spot area is visible. But the variation's amplitude is the maximum dip, which is this 5.18%.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's stated that the star has one hemisphere covered, so when it's rotating, the spots come into our view for a time. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible. So the amplitude is about 5.18% dip in brightness.

Now, the question is: what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve, assuming no spots?

The planet transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05178.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05178) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, Teff is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

Compute (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) = 6000^4 -5000^4.

Which is 6000^4 = (6^4) *1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5^4) *1e12 = 625e12.

Difference is 671e12.

So back to delta F / F1: 0.4 * 0.1 * (671e12) / (1296e12) )

Wait, no, I think I messed up the factor.

Wait, initial calculation: delta F/F = [ A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R² Teff^4 )

A_spot is 0.4 pi R².

So,

[ 0.4 pi R² * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ 4 pi R² Teff^4 ]

pi R² cancels. 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So yes, 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Which is 0.1 * 671e12 /1296e12.

Wait that's 0.1 * (671/1296) ≈ 0.1 * 0.5178 ≈ 0.05178.

So the dip is about 5.178% of the star's flux.

So the planet's transit dip would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05178 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05178) ≈ 0.2276.

Hmm, but none of the options are around 0.23. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view for half of the rotation period. But the maximum dip is when the full spot area is visible, which is when the entire hemisphere is facing us. Wait, no, because the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spot area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

Wait, but when the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire spot area is 0.4 pi R², but the total surface of the star is 4 pi R², so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1, or 10%. So the spot coverage is 10% of the entire star.

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view for half of the time. So the brightness variation would be a dip when the spots are visible, but perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is in view.

Wait, but the way I did the calculation earlier, the delta F / F is 5.18%, which is the same as when the planet blocks 5.18% of the star's area. So the planet would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But none of the options are close to 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the spots are in one hemisphere, but the way they rotate means that only half of the spots are visible at any time. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so if the entire hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible. So the maximum dip is when the hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as a sine wave because of the rotational modulation. For a spot on a rotating star, the brightness variation might be more complex than a simple dip, but in terms of amplitude, the maximum dip is when all spots are visible, which is when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing a factor in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Another approach: the variation in brightness is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, when the star is not showing any spots (the spots are on the far side), the flux is F1 = sigma Teff^4 *4 pi R^2.

When the star is showing all the spots, the flux is F2 = sigma Teff^4 (4 pi R^2 - A_spot) + sigma T_spot^4 A_spot.

So delta F = F1 - F2 = sigma A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the amplitude is delta F / F1 = [A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi R² Teff^4].

As before, A_spot is 0.4 pi R².

So delta F/F = (0.4 pi R² * (6e3^4 -5e3^4)) / (4 pi R² *6e3^4 )

The pi R² cancels, and 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So 0.1 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4) /6e3^4.

Which is 0.1*( (6^4 -5^4) (1e3^4) ) / (6^4 *1e3^4) ) → 0.1 * ( (1296 -625)/1296 ) → 0.1*(671/1296) ≈ 0.1 * 0.5178 ≈ 0.05178 or 5.18%.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.18%.

Now, for a planet transit, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05178 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05178) ≈ 0.2276.

But looking at the options, none is near 0.23. The closest is option D) 0.32, but that's 0.32, which is about 0.32^2=0.1024, which is a 10% dip. That's higher than 5.18%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the spot area. Let me re-examine the filling factor.

The problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) )= 0.4 pi R².

No, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the filling factor. Another possibility: the filling factor is the fraction of the total stellar surface covered by spots. If the entire star has spots covering 20% of its surface, that's a different scenario. But the problem says one hemisphere has a 20% filling factor. So that's 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation period makes the spots visible for only a certain amount of time, but the amplitude calculation is based on the maximum dip, so no. The amplitude is the maximum dip, so the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the observer sees only a part of the spots as the star rotates. The star is a sphere, so when it's viewed edge-on, the entire hemisphere is visible. But for a star, the maximum visible area is a hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible, so the amplitude is as calculated.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the spots are darker, so when they come into view, the observed flux decreases, but the variation could be more complex because the spots are on a sphere. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the equivalent area blocked by the planet.

Wait, but the planet's transit would block a certain area, causing a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So the amplitude here is 5.18%, which is 0.0518. So the planet's dip should be 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276. So none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the flux change. Let me recompute the term:

(Teff^4 - T_spot^4) → (6000^4 - 5000^4) = (6^4 -5^4) * 1e12.

6^4 is 1296, 5^4 is 625. So 1296-625 = 671. So 671e12.

So 671e12 / 6e3^4 = 671e12 /1296e12 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.5178.

Multiply by 0.1 (from 0.4/4), gives 0.05178 → 5.178%.

So the amplitude is about 5.18%.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the spot area. Let me think again: the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (area of a hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So that's correct.

But none of the options match the calculated 0.2276. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the observed variation is the same as the planet's transit. So the question is, what planet size would create the same amplitude as the spots?

But maybe I should model the situation in terms of the star's brightness.

The star emits with a certain flux. When a spot is visible, the flux is F = F_clean - (F_clean_spot - F_spot). The area of the spots is 0.4 pi R², and each spot's emission is less than the surrounding.

So perhaps the change in flux is:

delta F = F_clean - F_spotty = sigma * (Teff^4) * A_spot - sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * A_spot.

Wait, that's what I did before. So delta F = sigma A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, so perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another thought: the star's brightness variation due to the spots is actually the same as the planet's brightness variation. So the amplitude is the same. So the planet would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which equals the spot's (delta F / F).

So I think my calculation is correct, but perhaps the options are wrong or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the square root.

Wait, 0.0518 → sqrt is approximately 0.2276. But the options are all lower than that except option A (0.39) and D (0.32).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot area.

Wait, another possibility: when the star is rotating, the spots are only on the visible hemisphere for part of the time. So perhaps the average change is smaller.

Wait, no, the maximum change in flux is when the entire spot area is visible. So the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is the 5.18% I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the variation as the average over the rotation period, but I think it's looking for the amplitude, which is the maximum dip.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe I should model the flux emitted as a function of rotation.

Wait, perhaps the star has spots on one hemisphere. When the star rotates, the brightness varies because the spot coverage seen changes. The maximum dip is when the entire spot is visible. So the amplitude is 5.18%, as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the fact that only one hemisphere is spotty. Wait, because the star is rotating, when the spots are on the near side, they cause a dip, but when the star is at a certain rotation angle, perhaps only a portion of the spots are visible.

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the spots are 20% of that hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, because the entire star's surface is four hemispheres, each 2 pi R². So when one hemisphere is fully visible, the spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R², which is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1 (10%) of the star's surface.

So when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, 10% of the star's surface is spots, each at 5000 K.

Wait, so the delta F / F is 5.18% as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's, which is R_sun ≈ 7e5 km, but perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, another possible mistake: perhaps the problem is asking for the planet radius that would produce the same variation as the star's spots when the planet is not transiting. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the efficiency of the spot in reducing the flux. Wait, another way: the flux from the spots is F_spot = sigma T_spot^4 * A_spot.

The flux from the surrounding area is F_normal = sigma Teff^4 * (A_star - A_spot).

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F_total = F_normal + F_spot = sigma Teff^4 (A_star - A_spot) + sigma T_spot^4 A_spot.

The clean star's flux is F_clean = sigma Teff^4 A_star.

So the change in flux is delta F = F_clean - F_total = sigma A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Which is the same as before.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the amplitude is about 5.18%.

So the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276 Rstar.

But looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2=0.152 → 15.2% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 dip.

Wait, 5.18% is 0.0518, which is between option C (0.0121 → 1.21%) and perhaps no option. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot's filling factor. Let me think again. The star's radius is R_star. One hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere's area) = 0.2 * (2 pi R_star^2) )= 0.4 pi R_star^2.

So the spot area is 0.4 pi R².

The total surface area is 4 pi R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1 → 10% of the star's surface.

So when the star is rotating, the maximum spot coverage visible is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is viewed edge-on, the entire hemisphere is visible, but in reality, the observer can only see a portion of the spots when the star is not edge-on. But I think the problem assumes that the star is viewed edge-on, or that the maximum dip is considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star is observed from a distance, and the rotational modulation causes the spots to come in and out of view. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible, which is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the variation in terms of the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, another approach: The star's brightness is F = sigma Teff^4 * A, where A is the effective area (the sum of the non-spot and spot areas). So when the spots are visible, the effective area is A = (1 - f) * 4 pi R² + f_spot * A_spot.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness is F = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R² * (1 - f_spot) + sigma T_spot^4 * 4 pi R² * f_spot.

Wait, no, because f_spot is the fraction of the surface covered by spots, which is 0.1 (10%) in this case.

So F = sigma * [ (Teff^4) * (1 - f_spot) + T_spot^4 * f_spot ] * 4 pi R².

So the brightness when spots are visible is F_visible = sigma * [ (6000^4) * (0.9) + 5000^4 * 0.1 ] * 4 pi R².

The brightness when no spots are visible (the other hemisphere is facing us) is F_clean = sigma *6000^4 *4 pi R².

So the relative change is (F_clean - F_visible) / F_clean.

Compute F_visible: 

= sigma *4 pi R² [ 0.9 *6000^4 + 0.1 *5000^4 ]

So delta F = F_clean - F_visible = sigma *4 pi R² [ 6000^4 - (0.9 *6000^4 + 0.1 *5000^4) ]

= sigma *4 pi R² [ 0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4) ]

So delta F / F_clean = [0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] /6000^4.

Which is exactly the same as before: 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 0.05178.

So the same result.

Hmm, maybe I should reevaluate the options. Wait, perhaps the options are given as relative to the radius of the host star, which is the same as the Sun. So what's the Sun's radius? Approximately 7e5 km.

But the options are given as fractions, so no, it's Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, maybe I should compute it again.

delta_F/F = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(delta_F/F )

So delta_F/F is 0.05178 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05178) ≈ 0.2276.

So approximately 0.23.

But none of the options are close. The closest is option C) 0.11 → (0.11)^2=0.0121, which is 1.21%. Not close to 5.18%.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is when half of the spots are visible. No, that can't be, because the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, and when the hemisphere is fully visible, all the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's luminosity. The star's luminosity is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

The spots contribute L_spot = 4 pi R^2 * 0.1 * sigma T_spot^4.

So the variation in luminosity is delta L = L - L_spot.

So delta L = 4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - 0.1 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) )

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation period causes the spots to be visible for a certain amount of time, but the amplitude is the same as the planet's transit.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the relative change in flux when the planet transits, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, and set that equal to the spot's relative change.

But according to my calculations, the spot's relative change is ~5.18%, which would require a planet with Rpl/Rstar of about 0.23.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, not 5000 K. Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K, so the ratio is (6000/5000)^4 = (6/5)^4 = 1.296^4 ≈ 2.86.

So, when calculating the flux change:

( (6000^4 -5000^4) ) /6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 is (625/1296) ≈ 0.48125.

So 1-0.48125=0.51875. Multiply by 0.1, as before, gives 0.051875, which is 5.1875% change.

So, same result.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the star's rotation period. No, the question isn't about the period, just the amplitude.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Let me think again.

The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Hemisphere's area is 2 pi R². So spot area is 0.2 *2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

Star's total area is 4 pi R². So spot area is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1 → 10% of the star's surface.

So, when the spots are visible, 10% of the star's surface is at 5000 K.

So, F_visible = 0.9 * F_clean + 0.1 * F_spot.

F_clean is sigma Teff^4 *4 pi R².

F_spot is sigma (5000)^4 *4 pi R² * 0.1.

So, the delta F is F_clean - F_visible = F_clean - [0.9 F_clean + 0.1 F_spot ] = 0.1 (F_clean - F_spot).

Which is 0.1 * [ sigma 4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4) ].

So delta F = sigma 4 pi R² * 0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4).

Which again gives delta F / F_clean = 0.1*(6000^4 -5000^4)/(6000^4) = same 5.18%.

So I'm confident my calculation is correct.

But then the planet radius would have to be sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have that. So I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the exoplanet's size is such that it would cause the same dip as the spots, but perhaps I should compute the ratio Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

Wait, 0.227 is approximately 0.23, which is close to option D) 0.32? No, 0.23 is not close to 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot's area.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the star's radius is equal to the sun's, but when the planet transits, the dip is (Rpl + Rstar)/Rstar, but no, that's not correct. The transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is rotating, the spots are visible for a certain period, and the average dip is lower. But the question is about the amplitude, which is the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is not as large as the planet's dip because the spots are cooler but cover a small area.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the relative change.

Wait, another approach: compute the ratio of the planet's dip to the spot's dip.

The planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But if the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer isn't there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48125.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 6000^4 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 6000^4 * (1 - 0.48125) = 6000^4 * 0.51875.

So the relative change is (A_spot * 0.51875 * 6000^4 ) / (4 pi R² *6000^4 )

Which is (0.4 pi R² *0.51875) / (4 pi R² ) = 0.4 *0.51875 /4 → 0.4 *0.51875 =0.2075 → 0.2075/4=0.051875 → 5.1875%.

So same result.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots are visible for 50% of the time. So the average flux is F_avg = 0.5 * F_clean + 0.5 * F_visible.

But the amplitude of the variation would be the difference between F_clean and F_visible, which is what I calculated. So the maximum dip is 5.18%.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed from a certain angle, only a part of the spots is visible, leading to a lower dip. But I think that in the maximum case, all spots are visible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the star's brightness variation as a sinusoidal function due to the rotation, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the star's brightness variation is the same as the planet's, so the planet's radius is such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 equals the spot's delta F/F, which is 5.18%, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈0.227.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio again.

Wait, 0.227 is approximately 0.23, but none of the options match. So perhaps I should look for a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is the same as the planet's radius. No, the question asks for Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the inverse: the planet's signal is the same as the spot's, but perhaps the spot's signal is smaller because the spots are cooler, so the planet would need to block a larger area.

Wait, but the dip is based on the area blocked and the temperature difference. So the planet's dip is only based on the area, regardless of temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the planet's radius as follows:

The dip from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (delta F / F )

So Rpl = Rstar * sqrt( (delta F / F) )

But delta F / F is approximately 0.0518.

So Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.0518) ≈ Rstar * 0.227.

So 0.227 Rstar.

Again, the same result.

Hmm, perhaps the problem intended to have the spot's temperature difference as 500 K instead of 1000 K. Let me try that.

If T_spot is 5500 K, then delta is 500 K.

Compute (6000^4 -5500^4) = (6^4 -5.5^4) *1e12.

6^4=1296, 5.5^4=5.5*5.5=30.25; 30.25^2=915.0625.

So 1296 -915.0625=380.9375.

So delta F/F = 0.1 * (380.9375 /1296) = 0.1 * 0.2937 → 0.02937 or ~2.94%.

Then Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.02937) ≈ 0.1714.

Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the spots are 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Let's try that.

If the spots cover 20% of the entire star, A_spot = 0.2 *4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R².

Wait, that would make the delta F/F much higher.

Compute delta F/F = [0.8 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 pi R² *6000^4 ]

= (0.8 * (671e12 )) / (4 *1296e12 )

= (0.8 * 671 )/(4 *1296 )

= (536.8) / (5184 ) ≈ 0.1035 → 10.35%.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217 → ~0.32, which matches option D) ~0.32.

Ah, so perhaps I misinterpreted the filling factor. The problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor applies to the hemisphere, not the entire star. But perhaps the question meant that the entire star's surface has a 20% filling factor. That would change the calculation.

Wait, if the star's entire surface has a 20% spot coverage, then the spot area is 0.2 *4 pi R²=0.8 pi R².

So delta F/F = (0.8 pi R² * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 pi R² *6000^4 )

= (0.8 * 671e12 ) / (4 * 1296e12 )

= (536.8e12) / (5184e12 )

= 536.8/5184 ≈ 0.1035 → 10.35%.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217 → ~0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

Ah, I see where I might have made a mistake. The problem states "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area, not the entire star. So the spot area is 0.2*(2 pi R²)=0.4 pi R².

But if the entire star's surface has a 20% filling factor, the spot area would be 0.2 *4 pi R^2 =0.8 pi R^2.

So in that case, the delta F/F is about 10.35%, leading to Rpl/Rstar≈0.32.

But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty, so the spot area is 0.4 pi R², not 0.8 pi R².

But perhaps the problem intended that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, which would give the answer D) 0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the star's surface has a 20% spot coverage, meaning that the entire star has 20% spots. In that case, the calculation leads to option D.

But according to the problem statement, one hemisphere is covered with 20% filling factor, so the correct spot area is 0.4 pi R², leading to delta F/F of ~5.18%, and Rpl/Rstar ~0.227.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended approach was to consider the entire star's 20% coverage, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the star's entire surface. So the spot area is 0.2 *4 pi R²=0.8 pi R².

So delta F/F = (0.8 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (4 pi R² 6e3^4 )

= 0.8 *671e12 / (4 *1296e12 )

= 536.8e12 / (5184e12 )= 536.8/5184≈0.1035 → 10.35%

Which leads to Rpl/Rstar=sqrt(0.1035)=~0.3217→ option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

But the question states that only one hemisphere is spotty, which suggests that the spot area is 0.4 pi R², not 0.8 pi R².

Unless the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

Wait, the question says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the spot area is 0.2*(2 pi R²) =0.4 pi R².

But in that case, the maximum dip is 5.18%, which isn't among the options.

So perhaps the problem intended that the spot area is 20% of the entire star.

In that case, the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

But according to the problem statement, the spot area is 0.4 pi R².

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but the exoplanet's radius is being compared to the host star's radius, which is the same as the Sun's. So perhaps the exoplanet's radius is in solar radii.

Wait, but the problem states "the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)".

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the planet's radius such that the dip is the same as the spot's variation, which is 5.18%, leading to Rpl/Rstar ~0.227, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the flux change. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses (T_spot / Teff)^4 instead of (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, the flux change is (F_clean - F_spotty) / F_clean.

F_clean = sigma Teff^4 *4 pi R².

F_spotty = sigma Teff^4 (4 pi R² - A_spot) + sigma T_spot^4 A_spot.

So delta F = F_clean - F_spotty = sigma A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So delta F / F_clean = [A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 pi R² Teff^4 ]

But with A_spot =0.4 pi R².

So:

delta F/F = (0.4 pi R² (6e3^4 -5e3^4 )) / (4 pi R² 6e3^4 )

= 0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4) / (4 *6e3^4 )

= 0.4 (671e12) / (4 *1296e12 )

= 0.4*671 / (4*1296 ) → 268.4 /5184 → approx 0.0517.

Same result.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is when half the spot area is visible. No, that would be a mistake because the entire spot area is in the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation period causes the spots to be in view for half the time, so the average flux is lower, but the amplitude is the same as calculated.

I'm stuck. Based on the given options, I think the intended answer is D) ~0.32, assuming the spot area is 20% of the entire star's surface. But according to the problem statement, it's 20% of one hemisphere, leading to a different result.

But since the options don't have 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is D) 0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**. This means the spots cover \( 0.2 \times \text{hemisphere area} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).

2. **Spot Properties**:
   - Temperature: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) (1000 K cooler than the star's effective temperature).

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness variation is caused by the rotational modulation of the spotted hemisphere. The amplitude of the variation depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The total flux from the star when no spots are visible is:
\[
F_{\text{clean}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2
\]
When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced because the spots emit less energy:
\[
F_{\text{spotty}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot (4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 - A_{\text{spot}}) + \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \cdot A_{\text{spot}}
\]
where \( A_{\text{spot}} = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the area of the spots.

The change in flux is:
\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{clean}} - F_{\text{spotty}} = \sigma A_{\text{spot}} (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)
\]
The relative change in flux is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{\sigma A_{\text{spot}} (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{\sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}
\]
Substituting \( A_{\text{spot}} = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), the equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot 6000^4}
\]
The \( \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) terms cancel, leaving:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \cdot 6000^4}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Numerical Value
1. Compute \( 6000^4 \) and \( 5000^4 \):
   \[
   6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12}, \quad 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^{12}
   \]
   \[
   6000^4 - 5000^4 = 671 \times 10^{12}
   \]

2. Substitute into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 671 \times 10^{12}}{4 \cdot 1296 \times 10^{12}}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{268.4}{5184} \approx 0.0518 \, (\text{or } 5.18\%)
   \]

### Step 3: Relate to the Exoplanet's Radius
The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to:
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]
Setting this equal to the spot-induced variation:
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.0518
\]
Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0518} \approx 0.227
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Options
The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem assumes the spots cover **20% of the entire star's surface** (rather than just one hemisphere), the spot area would be:
\[
A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \cdot 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8\pi R_{\text{star}}^2
\]
Recomputing the relative flux change with this assumption:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{0.8\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot 6000^4}
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 671 \times 10^{12}}{4 \cdot 1296 \times 10^{12}}
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{clean}}} = \frac{536.8}{5184} \approx 0.1035 \, (\text{or } 10.35\%)
\]
Then:
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035 \implies \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
\]
This matches **Option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion
Given the ambiguity in interpreting the filling factor, the most reasonable assumption to align with the provided options is that the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface. Under this assumption, the radius of the exoplanet is approximately \( 0.32 \, R_{\text{star}} \).

**Answer: D**
