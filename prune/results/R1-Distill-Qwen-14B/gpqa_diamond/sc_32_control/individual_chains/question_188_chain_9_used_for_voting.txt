Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral structures have all sides equal but the angles can be different. Wait, no, wait. In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell has all edges of equal length, but the angles can vary. I think in this problem, the angles are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait, the question says alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So that's a rhombohedral structure with all angles equal.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I recall that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice constants. Oh right, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) * (cos α etc.) ) but wait, maybe I'm mixing some terms here. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the Miller indices and the structure factor.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so θ is the same for each pair of vectors.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused. Because in a cubic system, the formula is simpler. But for a rhombohedral, which is a special case of hexagonal? Or no, rhombohedral is a separate crystal system, right?

Let me get this straight. A rhombohedral unit cell has all edges equal (a = b = c), and the angles α, β, γ are all equal as well. So in this problem, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and all angles are 30 degrees.

The (111) plane means h=1, k=1, l=1. So plugging into the formula. Wait, what's the formula again? Oh yeah, the general formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos\gamma - 2hl \cos\beta - 2kl \cos\alpha } }

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So cos(α) = cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So substituting h=k=l=1:

d = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) )

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step.

The numerator in the sqrt is:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

The next terms are -2(hk cos gamma) -2(hl cos beta) -2(kl cos alpha). Since all angles are 30 degrees:

Each of these terms is -2*(1*1)*(sqrt(3)/2). Because cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2.

So each term is -2*(1)*(sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3). Since there are three such terms, it's 3*(-sqrt(3)) = -3*sqrt(3).

So putting it all together:

sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait, no. Because the denominator is sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the vectors. Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, each pair of vectors (a, b, c) have angles α, β, gamma. But in our case, all are 30 degrees. So when we compute the terms, for each pair (a and b, a and c, b and c), the angle is 30 degrees.

So in the formula, for each pair hk, you have to multiply by the angle between them. So for each term in the expression, it's cos of the angle between the respective vectors.

Wait, but when you have the (hkl) plane, the formula involves the sum over all pairs. So for h and k, which vectors are they? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the metric tensor.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the formula more accurately. The general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos\gamma - 2hl \cos\beta - 2kl \cos\alpha } }

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So substituting h=k=l=1, and all cos terms are cos(30):

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2*(1*1)(sqrt(3)/2) * 3 )

Wait, wait, let's compute each part.

The denominator's square root term is:

3 - 2*(1*1)*sqrt(3)/2 * 3?

Wait, no. Let me recompute:

Each term in the denominator is:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 3.

Then subtract 2*(hk cos gamma) + 2*(hl cos beta) + 2*(kl cos alpha).

Each of these is 2*(1*1)*cos(30) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). And there are three such terms (hk, hl, kl), so 3 * sqrt(3).

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, but 3 - 3*sqrt(3) is approximately 3 - 5.196 = negative. Oh no, that can't be right, because that would make the square root of a negative number, which is impossible. So I must have messed up the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. Alternatively, I might have the sign wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general formula for d_{hkl} in any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1/ sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) + k^2 (1/b^2) + l^2 (1/c^2)) + 2(hk (cos γ)/(a b) + hl (cos β)/(a c) + kl (cos α)/(b c)) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta.

So let me substitute that into the formula.

Let a = b = c = a0 = 10 Angstrom.

So:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) + 2[ hk (cosθ)/(a0^2) + hl (cosθ)/(a0^2) + kl (cosθ)/(a0^2) ] )

Factor out 1/a0²:

d = 1 / sqrt( [ (h² +k² +l²) + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ ] / a0² )

Which simplifies to:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

Wait, but that denominator inside the sqrt is:

h² +k² +l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ.

Wait, but for h=k=l=1, this becomes:

1 + 1 +1 + 2*1*1*cos30 *3 → because 3 terms of 2*1*1 cosθ.

So 3 + 3 * 2 * (√3/2) → 3 + 3√3.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 3√3) → sqrt(3(1 + √3)) ) → sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 +√3).

So d = a0 / [ sqrt(3(1 + √3)) ) ]

a0 is 10 Angstrom. So:

d = 10 / sqrt(3(1 + √3)).

Wait, let me compute that numerically.

Compute the denominator:

3(1 + sqrt(3)) ≈ 3*(1 + 1.732) ≈ 3*(2.732) ≈ 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.493 Angstrom.

Wait, but that's way smaller than the options given. The options are around 8-10 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm. Did I get the formula wrong? Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ). Wait, earlier I thought that, but then the denominator became negative.

Wait, let me recompute using that formula.

d = a / sqrt(3 - 3 * (sqrt(3)/2)*2 )

Wait, no. Let me re-derive it.

The correct formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, wait, but when I plug in h=k=l=1 and theta=30:

Denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(1 +1 +1) * cos30 )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2)) → sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, 3 - 3 * 1.732 ≈ 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. The square root of a negative number is not possible, which can't be right. So that suggests I have the wrong formula.

I think I must have made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is different when the angles are all the same. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (sqrt(3)/2) * 2 )

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the dot product. The interplanar distance is given by:

d = |c| / ( sqrt( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 - 2 h k (a b cos gamma) - 2 h l (a c cos beta) - 2 k l (b c cos alpha) ) ) )

But because in rhombohedral, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, this simplifies.

So let's substitute a = b = c = a0, and all angles 30 degrees, cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( h² a0² + k² a0² + l² a0² - 2hk a0² cos30 - 2hl a0² cos30 - 2kl a0² cos30 )

Factor out a0²:

sqrt( a0² [ h² + k² + l² - 2hk (sqrt(3)/2) - 2hl (sqrt(3)/2) - 2kl (sqrt(3)/2) ] )

Which is a0 * sqrt( h² + k² + l² - sqrt(3) (hk + hl + kl) )

So d = a0 / ( sqrt( h² + k² + l² - sqrt(3) (hk + hl + kl) ) )

Because d = |c| / denominator, and |c| is a0.

Wait, no: in the formula, d= |c| / [ sqrt( (h a)^2 + ... ) ]

Wait, no, the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) + k^2 (1/b^2) + l^2 (1/c^2)) + 2 (h k (cos gamma) )/(a b) + 2 (h l cos beta)/(a c) + 2 (k l cos alpha)/(b c) ) )

But in this case, a=b=c= a0, so 1/a^2 is 1/a0², and cos terms are same.

So:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²)/a0² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cos(30)) / a0² )

Which is same as d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) (cos(30)) )

Because I factored out 1/a0², denominator becomes a0 * sqrt( ... )

So h=k=l=1, cos30= ~0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2*(3)*(0.866) = 3 + 6*(0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.493 Angstrom.

Again, but that gives about 3.49 Angstrom, which is way off the options given (the options are ~9-10 Angstrom). So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Maybe d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

Wait, but that would make the denominator bigger, so d smaller. Alternatively, maybe the formula is d= a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but that led to a negative denominator earlier. So perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the inverse of the metric tensor. Let me think: the reciprocal lattice vector components are given by (h, k, l), and the interplanar distance is 1/sqrt(h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha).

Wait, but in the metric tensor approach, the volume of the unit cell is a^3 multiplied by some function of the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( [ (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 ] + [ 2 (h k cos gamma)/(a b) + 2 (h l cos beta)/(a c) + 2 (k l cos alpha)/(b c) ] )

But when a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma, this simplifies to:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k^2 + l^2)/a^2 + 2 (hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30)/a^2 )

= a / sqrt( h² +k^2 + l^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos30 )

So same as before, which gives d ≈3.49 Angstrom. But this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different definition of the rhombohedral system, maybe it's a face-centered or body-centered system? Or perhaps I confused the angles. Oh wait! Wait a minute, in some cases, the angles in the formula are the angles between the vectors, but in rhombohedral, the angles are between the edges. So perhaps I'm using the wrong angles.

Wait, no. In a rhombohedral system, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the edges of the unit cell. So a and b form angle alpha, a and c form beta, and b and c form gamma. But in this problem, all are 30 degrees.

Wait, but in the formula, when you have a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and all angles alpha=beta=gamma, you can model it as a cube that's been skewed in all directions equally. So perhaps in this case, the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) can be calculated using:

d = a / sqrt( [ (h + k + l)^2 - 3(h² + k² + l²) ] ) * something. Wait, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ), where theta is the angle between the edges. Hmm, but how does that help me here?

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

As before. But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2.

So with h=k=l=1, denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(3*(1)(1)(sqrt(3)/2)) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, that's about sqrt(3-5.196) → sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary, which can't be correct. So that suggests that either the formula is wrong, or I have the angles wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angles in the formula are 180 - theta, because sometimes the angles in the formula are the angles between the vectors, but in a rhombohedral system, the vectors form acute or obtuse angles. Wait, 30 degrees is acute, but perhaps the formula requires the angles between the vectors to be 180-30=150 degrees because of the way vectors are arranged.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when a rhombohedral system has angles less than 90 degrees, the interplanar distances would be smaller, but if the angles between the vectors are actually 150 degrees, which are obtuse, that might change the outcome.

Wait, let me think about the structure. In a rhombohedral system, the vectors a, b, c are all of equal length and the angles between them are all equal. But wait, the angle between vectors a and b is alpha, which is 30 degrees. So a · b = |a||b|cos(alpha) = a² cos(30). But if the angle between vectors is 30 degrees, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps in the formula for d, the angles used are the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors, which for a rhombohedral system can be 180 - alpha. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula of interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system when all angles are equal.

Wait, after some research in my mind, I recall that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) plane is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

where θ is the angle between the vectors (e.g., 30 degrees in this problem).

But as before, for (111), this would give a negative value under the square root, which is impossible, so maybe I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

In that case, the denominator is 3 + 2*(3)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) → 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864, so d ≈ 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom. But this doesn't match the options.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is close to the lattice parameter of 10 Angstrom. How can that be?

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system is a major plane, perhaps the (100) plane, but no, the question is about (111).

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the interplanar distance with the atomic distance. Oh wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which is the same as the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (100) would be a, but for (111), it's smaller.

Hmm, but according to the options, all are around 9-10 Angstrom. So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should think of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^(1/2)

Wait, but that gives the same result as before.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane is a higher-order plane, but the interplanar distance formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should use the vector approach. The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector G for (hkl) is given by:

G = h a* + k b* + l c*,

where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal basis vectors are given by:

a* = (1/a) (e_x - cosβ e_y - cosγ e_z ) / ... (Wait, this is getting complicated.)

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

g = [ [ 1, cosα, cosβ ],
       [ cosα, 1, cosγ ],
       [ cosβ, cosγ, 1 ] ] * a².

In this case, since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, the g matrix becomes:

g = a² * [ [ 1, cos30, cos30 ],
            [ cos30, 1, cos30 ],
            [ cos30, cos30, 1 ] ]

The reciprocal metric tensor G is the inverse of g. The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is G = (h, k, l). The magnitude squared of G is:

G · G = h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 + 2 h k g_12 + 2 h l g_13 + 2 k l g_23.

But since g is symmetric, g_12 = g_21, etc.

So for (111):

G² = 1²*(1) + 1²*(1) + 1²*(1) + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30.

So G² = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

The magnitude of G is sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864 a.

The interplanar distance d is 1/(G/a) ) → a / (sqrt(8.196)) → same as before, ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But this is way off the given options, which are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a crystal is the lattice parameter times something. But in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, but in other structures, it can be different.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner, and each atom touches its neighbor along the edge, so the interatomic distance is a. So in that case, the interatomic distance is equal to a. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom in this rhombohedral crystal. So that would mean a = 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, are the atoms at the corners? Or is it a face-centered or body-centered structure? Hmm, the term 'rhombohedral' refers to the shape of the unit cell, but the crystal structure (SC, BCC, FCC, etc.) determines the interatomic distance.

Wait, but the problem says it's a rhombohedral crystal, but doesn't specify the structure type. So perhaps it's a simple structure where the interatomic distance is a. So a = 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same issue. So perhaps the formula is correct, but the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the angles in the formula are not 30 degrees, but 150 degrees. Because in some cases, when the angle between vectors is acute, the interplanar distance could be larger, but that's not making sense.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think about the vectors a, b, c in the rhombohedral system. If the angle between a and b is 30 degrees, then their dot product is a*b cos30. But in the metric tensor, that's used, but perhaps in the reciprocal lattice, the angles are different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta } }

Wait, with theta being 30 degrees.

So for h=k=l=1, that's sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)) = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) ≈ sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864, so 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom. Still, it's not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach is to model the rhombohedral system as a distorted cubic system. In a cubic system, the (111) interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3). So for a cubic system with a=10, d = 10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstrom. But again, the options are higher.

Wait, but given that the angles are 30 degrees, which is less than 90, making the interplanar distance shorter. So in a cubic case, it's 5.77, but in our case, perhaps it's larger. But according to the formula, it's 3.49, which is even smaller.

So this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the (111) plane, but about (110) or another plane. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the formula should instead be using the supplementary angles. Let me think: if the vectors a, b, c form 30-degree angles, the reciprocal lattice vectors would form 150-degree angles. So perhaps the formula should use cos(150) instead of cos(30). Because cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2.

So let me try that.

Compute the denominator:

h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta), where theta is 150 degrees.

So cos(theta)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator inside sqrt is:

3 - 2*(3)*(-sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

d=10 / 2.864≈3.49 Angstrom. Same result as before. Not matching.

Wait, but perhaps in the formula, the angles are the angles between the reciprocal vectors, which are 180-theta. So cos(theta) becomes cos(180-theta)= -cos(theta).

Wait, so perhaps the formula should use cos(150 degrees) because the reciprocal vectors have angles of 150 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the relation between the direct and reciprocal lattice vectors.

The angle between the reciprocal vectors is 180 minus the angle between the direct vectors. So if the direct vectors have an angle of 30 degrees, the reciprocal vectors have 150 degrees between them.

So in the formula for the reciprocal lattice, the angles used are 150 degrees.

So in the formula:

d_{hkl}= a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(150) )

Because the reciprocal vectors have 150-degree angles.

So cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So substituting:

Denominator inside sqrt:

3 - 2*(3)*(-sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

Which is the same as before, leading to d=3.49 Angstrom. Again, not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The options given are all around 9 Angstrom, which is close to the lattice parameter of 10. Perhaps it's a trick question where the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance, but that can't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane in this structure is actually a (100) plane, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the system is a face-centered cubic, but it was described as rhombohedral.

Wait, maybe the question is using a different rhombohedral system, like a hexagonal close-packed structure. But no, hexagonal is a different crystal system.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula for the interplanar distance. Let me try another approach.

The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ (h^2 (1/a^2) + k^2 (1/b^2) + l^2 (1/c^2)) + 2(hk (cos γ)/(a b) + hl (cos β)/(a c) + kl (cos α)/(b c)) } }

In this problem, a=b=c=10, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So plugging in:

d = 1 / sqrt( (1^2/(10^2) +1^2/(10^2) +1^2/(10^2)) + 2 [ (1*1 cos30)/(10*10) + (1*1 cos30)/(10*10) + (1*1 cos30)/(10*10) ] )

Simplify each term:

Each 1/(10^2) = 0.01. So the first part is 3 * 0.01 = 0.03.

Second part: each term is (1 * cos30)/(100) → (0.866)/100=0.00866. There are three such terms, so 3 * 0.00866 ≈0.02598.

So denominator inside sqrt:

0.03 + 0.02598 = 0.05598.

sqrt(0.05598) ≈0.2366.

So d=1 / 0.2366≈4.226 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Wait, but that's different from previous results. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

Wait, but 4.226 is not among the options either. The options are around 8.9-10 Angstrom.

Hmm. I must be making a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, in the formula above, the denominator is sum of terms, and I take the reciprocal. So:

d = 1 / sqrt( [3/(10^2) ) + 2*(3*(cos30)/(10^2)) ] )

Wait, 3/(10^2)= 3/100=0.03.

The second part: 2 * [ 3 * (sqrt(3)/2) / (10^2) ]

So 2 * [ (3*sqrt(3)/2 ) / 100 ]

The 2 and denominator 2 cancel, so it becomes 3*sqrt(3)/100.

So 3*sqrt(3)≈5.196 → 5.196/100=0.05196.

So denominator inside sqrt: 0.03 + 0.05196=0.08196.

sqrt(0.08196)= approximately 0.2863.

So d=1/0.2863≈3.49 Angstrom. Again, same value.

I must be missing something here. None of these approaches give a value near the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different definition or I'm making a calculation mistake. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) + k^2 (1/b^2) + l^2 (1/c^2)) + 2 (hk (cos gamma)/(a b) + hl (cos beta)/(a c) + kl (cos alpha)/(b c)) )

Wait, in this case, a=b=c=10, so:

= 1 / sqrt( (3*(1/100)) + 2*(3*(cos30)/(100)) )

=1 / sqrt( 0.03 + 2*(3*(0.866)/100) )

Wait, no, the 2 isn't multiplied by 3 here. Let me see:

Each term is hk (cos gamma)/(a b). Since h=k=l=1, and a=b=c=10.

So each term is (1)(1) cos30 / (10)(10) ) = (0.866)/100 = 0.00866.

There are three such terms (hk, hl, kl), each contributing 0.00866. So the sum is 3 * 0.00866 = 0.02598.

So the expression inside the sqrt is:

0.03 + 0.02598 = 0.05598.

sqrt(0.05598)=~0.2366.

So d= 1/0.2366≈4.226 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the lattice parameter being 10 Angstrom, but the interatomic distance is different.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1 =a. But in a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2 ≈ 0.707a. Or in a body-centered cubic, it's a√3/3≈0.577a.

But in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance can be more complex. Wait, but the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a is larger than 10.

Wait, wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is not the same as the interatomic distance. For example, in a simple cubic structure, a equals the interatomic distance. But in other structures, it's different. So if the interatomic distance is 10, but the lattice parameter is, say, larger, then perhaps a=10*2=20. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along a different direction. For example, if interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, which is the diagonal, then the lattice parameter a would be interatomic distance * something.

Wait, perhaps in a simple cubic system, the (111) interplanar distance is a/sqrt(3). If the interatomic distance is 10 along the (111) direction, then a =10 * sqrt(3) ≈17.32 Angstrom. But then the interplanar distance for (111) would be 10, but that's not what the question is asking.

The question is asking for the (111) interplanar distance of a crystal where the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom and lattice angles are 30 degrees.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is supposed to be:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ) )

With theta = 30 degrees.

So:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 - 6 * cos30 )

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 6 * 0.866 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196 → sqrt(-2.196) is imaginary. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 180 - theta, so cos(theta) becomes -cos(30) = -0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6*(-0.866)) = sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d=10 /2.864≈3.49 Angstrom.

Again, this doesn't match the options. So perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the angles to be 60 degrees instead of 30, but that's speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach where the interplanar distance is calculated as a / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)^0.5, but that would be the case for a cubic system, leading to 10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps someone made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are wrong.

But given the options, perhaps I should re-examine my approach.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane's interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - 2 cos theta + cos^2 theta)) )

Wait, where theta is 30 degrees.

So let's compute:

sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - 2*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 )

= sqrt(3) * sqrt( 1 - sqrt(3) + (3/4) )

= sqrt(3) * sqrt( (4 - 4 sqrt(3) +3 ) /4 )

= sqrt(3) * sqrt( (7 -4 sqrt(3)) /4 )

= sqrt(3) * [ sqrt(7 -4 sqrt(3)) / 2 ]

Hmm, compute 7-4*1.732=7-6.928=0.072.

So sqrt(0.072)≈0.268.

So:

sqrt(3) * 0.268 /2 ≈1.732 *0.268 /2 ≈0.463.

So d=10 / 0.463≈21.6 Angstrom. Which isn't matching.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / (sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )) )

But for (111), (h+k+l)=3, (h² + ... )=3.

So denominator is sqrt(9 -3 )=sqrt(6)≈2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08 Angstrom. Still not matching.

I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe it's time to look for another approach or perhaps the answer is option B) 8.95 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) )) * sqrt(1 - cosθ )

But that's not a standard formula.

Alternatively, perhaps using:

d = a / ( sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) ) )

But for theta=30, 1 - cos30≈0.134.

So denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2*3*(0.134) =3 + 0.804=3.804. sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129. Still not matching.

I'm stuck. Given that none of the calculations yield any of the options, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (sqrt( ... )) → but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) (cos theta) )) )

But as before, this leads to a negative denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for rhombohedral is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) \sqrt{3} } }

So for (111):

d= 10 / sqrt(3 - (3)*sqrt(3)/2 )

Wait, let's compute denominator:

3 - (3 * 0.866) =3 - 2.598=0.402.

sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

d=10 /0.634≈15.77 Angstrom. Not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / (sqrt(1 + 2 cos theta))

For (111), but that's not applicable here.

Wait, 1 + 2 cos30 = 1 + 1.732=2.732. sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

d=10/1.652≈6.05 Angstrom.

Nope.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options given, the closest to the possible correct answer is option B) 8.95 Angstrom. But I can't see how to get that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using a different approach.

Another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the volume V of the unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos² θ + 2 cos^3 θ) ), where theta is 30 degrees.

Compute V:

Compute 1 -3*( (√3/2)^2 ) + 2*( (√3/2)^3 )

=1 -3*(3/4) + 2*( (3√3)/(8) )

=1 - 9/4 + (6√3)/8

= (4/4 -9/4) + (3√3)/4

= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 ≈ (-1.25) + (5.196/4 ) ≈ (-1.25)+1.299≈0.049.

So V= a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 10³ * 0.222≈ 2220 Angstrom^3.

But not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the volume. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate using the formula I found earlier, but with a different approach. Or perhaps the formula in the question is written differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that led to a negative denominator. But perhaps the question has a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ), and in this case, theta=60 degrees, not 30. Because 30 degrees leads to a negative, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees.

Wait, if theta=60, cos60=0.5.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 2*(3)*(0.5) =3 -3=0. So d is infinity, which is not possible.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 90 degrees. Then cos90=0.

Denominator: 3. So d=10/sqrt(3)≈5.77.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps I've got the formula wrong, and the correct formula is a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )).

So for theta=30, denominator is sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d=10/2.864≈3.49 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )) * something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell's geometry.

In a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane is a close-packed plane if the angles are 60 degrees, but in this case, it's 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )

So let's compute this.

For (111):

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 2*(3)*(1 - cos30 )

=3 + 6*(1 - 0.866 )

=3 +6*(0.134 )

=3 + 0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

So d=10/1.95≈5.129 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Given that I'm stuck and can't find a way to match the options, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

But wait, perhaps the formula is using the angles in a different way. Let's think: maybe for rhombohedral, the interplanar distance is a / (h + k + l) * something.

Wait, for (111), h+k+l=3.

So perhaps:

d= a / (3) * something.

If a=10, then 10/3≈3.33 Angstrom. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 + 2 (hk +hl +kl) ) ).

So sqrt(3 +6)=3.

d=10/3≈3.33 Angstrom.

Nope.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a / (sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 - 3(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) ), which for (111) becomes sqrt(9 -9)=0, which is impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the interatomic distance along the (111) direction, not the interplanar distance. But that's a different calculation.

Wait, the interatomic distance along the (111) direction would be a√3, so 10 * 1.732 ≈17.32 Angstrom. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the distance between two planes in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula d = a / (h² +k² + l^2)^(1/2) * (1 + cos(theta)).

So for (111), (h² +k² + l^2)=3. So:

d=10/(sqrt(3)) * (1 + cos30) = 5.7735 * (1 + 0.866) =5.7735 *1.866≈10.76 Angstrom.

Close to option D)10.05, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula has a different factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 + cos theta) ) )

But that would make denominator larger, so d smaller.

Wait, for theta=30, 1+cos30=1.866.

Denominator: 3 +6 *1.866=3 +11.196=14.196 → sqrt≈3.77.

d=10/3.77≈2.65 Angstrom. Not matching.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've tried all possible approaches and none of them yield any of the given options. Perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, maybe in a rhombohedral system with all angles equal to 30 degrees, the plane (111) is a Miller plane that corresponds to a face of the unit cell, leading to a larger interplanar distance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d_{hkl} = a / (sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 )) * (1 - cos(theta))

So for theta=30:

d=10/sqrt(3) * (1 - 0.866) ≈5.7735 * 0.134≈0.772 Angstrom. No.

Hmm.

Given that I can't find a way to get any of the options, perhaps I should consider that my initial approach was correct, and the answer is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the question has a typo or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom. Let me try to see how.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But with alpha=beta=gamma=60 degrees.

Wait, cos60=0.5.

So denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(3 *0.5 )) = sqrt(3 -3 )=0. Impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta), where theta=60.

Denominator: 3 - 6*(0.5)=3-3=0. Impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) )

With theta=60, cos=0.5.

Denominator: 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 120 degrees, cos= -0.5.

Denominator:3 + 6*(-0.5)=3-3=0. Again, impossible.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the interplanar distance is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but that's not among the options. Perhaps the question intended to use a different angle or a different crystal system. Alternatively, the options might have a mistake.

Since I can't find the correct approach, I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking at the options, option B is 8.95 Angstrom. Perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstrom, which is close to 10 * (sqrt(3)/ sqrt( (3 + 3 * sqrt(3)) ) ) or something like that.

Wait, sqrt(3)=1.732. Let me compute 3 +3*1.732=3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.864. 10/2.864≈3.49.

Wait, but 10 / sqrt( (3 +3*sqrt(3)) ) =10/ sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

Wait, but what if the formula is:

d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) ) / sqrt(3 - 3 * sqrt(3)) )

Wait, that's 10 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(3-5.196)=10*1.732 / sqrt(-2.196). Imaginary again.

Not helpful.

Given that I can't find a way to get the options, perhaps I should select option B)8.95 Angstrom as the closest to 9, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta}}
\]

Here, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos\theta = \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**: \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \).

2. **Denominator**:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \),
   - \( -2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta = -2(3) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -3\sqrt{3} \),
   - Total inside the square root: \( 3 - 3\sqrt{3} \).

   However, \( 3 - 3\sqrt{3} \) is negative, which is physically impossible. This suggests that the formula might need adjustment or that the problem's parameters are inconsistent with the given options.

Given the inconsistency in the calculations and the lack of a match between the derived values and the provided options, it is unclear how to reconcile the derived interplanar distance with the given choices. Despite extensive attempts to adjust the formula or reinterpret the problem, none of the approaches yielded a result consistent with the options provided.

Based on the given options, the closest plausible answer is **B) 8.95 Å**, though the reasoning behind this value remains unclear. It is possible that the problem contains an error or that additional context is required to resolve the discrepancy.

Answer: B
