Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's go through each piece of data and see what I can deduce.

The question says that FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry were used. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch, often around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a peak in that region too. But wait, another thing: if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an -OH group. Also, looking at the other IR peaks—there are strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or an aromatic ring (like C=C in conjugation). But 1650 might also be a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. That suggests maybe an alkene group is present.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I think m/z 45 is significant. Let me recall—common fragments at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH2OCH3? Wait, no, that's higher. Oh wait, another approach: 45 could be a fragment like (CH3)2O, but that's 45 (since (CH3)2O is (15 for O) + 2*(15 for each CH3, 12 +3*1=15) → 15 + 30=45. So that's 45. Or maybe CH2OCH2 or something else. Alternatively, another common fragment is the acetylene ion, but that's 27. Or maybe a methyl ester or something else.

Wait, but 45 is also the molecular weight of HCO-O-R, but that might not fit. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketone or an ester group. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment. Hmm.

Now, looking at the possible options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So the options vary in the number of hydrogens and oxygens. Let's think about each.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700. If the compound has a carbonyl group, which is likely, and an -OH group, then it might be an ester or a ketone with an alcohol. Wait, but an ester would have a carbonyl around 1740-1700, which fits the 1700 peak. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, maybe an conjugated carbonyl or another group. Alternatively, an ester might have two carbonyl peaks? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 1650 could be from a conjugated carbonyl, like a C=O next to a double bond. So maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. That would explain the 1650 peak as C=C in conjugation with C=O.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests an alkene. So perhaps it's an ester with an alkene group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like methyl acrylate.

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me think about the possible formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular formula for this would be, let's see, 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. The degree of unsaturation: each degree is either a ring or a double bond. So for C6H12O2: the formula is CnH2nOx. For n=6, 2n=12, so the H count is exactly 12, which would be expected for a fully saturated molecule. But wait, but if it's C6H12O2, then the degrees of unsaturation are (2n +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=6, H=12, X=O=2? Wait, no, X is halogens, which are not present here. So O doesn't count in this calculation. So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But we have both an alkene (from the NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR), which would require two double bonds. But that's two DoU, but the formula only allows for one. So that would be a problem. So this option may not fit.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:

DoU = (2n +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, n=6, H=12, X=0, N=0. So 2*6=12. 12 +2=14. 14-12=2. 2/2=1. So DoU is 1. So only one ring or double bond. But the compound has both a carbonyl group (double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), that's two DoU. So this might not align with option A, unless there's a ring, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of a ring, like a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have fewer DoU. Hmmm, perhaps that's possible. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: C6H10O. So 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 1 oxygen. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. So if the compound has both an alkene (from NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR), then that's two DoU. So this could fit. But wait, the IR has two carbonyl peaks? Or is one the carbonyl and the other something else?

Wait, the IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound has an ester (which would have a carbonyl around 1700), and perhaps another carbonyl group elsewhere, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (if there's a benzene ring), but that would require more DoU. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. For instance, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would have a lower carbonyl stretch. So the 1700 could be from the ketone, and the 1650 from the conjugated double bond. That would make sense.

But then, the formula under option B is C6H10O. If the compound has a ketone and an alkene, that's two DoU, which fits. So that's possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. So DoU: (14 -10)/2= 2. Again, two DoU. So this could have a carbonyl (like ester) and an alkene. Or perhaps two carbonyls, but that would require more oxygens. So if it's an ester, which has one carbonyl, and an alkene, that would use up two DoU. So that's possible.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So only one DoU. But the compound has a carbonyl (double bond) and an alkene (another double bond), which would require two DoU. So this can't be, unless there's a ring involved that accounts for one DoU and the double bonds account for the other.

Wait, but maybe the carbonyl is part of a ring. For example, in a cyclic ketone. So if there's a ring (counts as one DoU) and a double bond (another), that would make two DoU. But the formula D has only one DoU. So that's a problem. So D can't be correct.

Now, let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about what that could be.

45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (O) + 2*(15, since CH3 is 15) = 45. So perhaps the fragment is (CH3)2O+. Or another possibility is CH2O2, but that's 44 (12 + 16 +16=44). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O or something else.

Wait, another approach: what's the most common fragment at m/z 45? Let me think. I remember that in mass spectrometry, a common fragment is the methyl group (15), but 45 is three times that. Alternatively, maybe a ketene ion, which is a fragment where a carbonyl group is adjacent to a double bond. Or perhaps a methoxy group loss.

Wait, let me think about the possible molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight would be 12*6 +12 +16*2=72+12+32=116. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 116. But the fragment is at 45.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98. So the fragment at 45 is 98-45=53. But I'm not sure what that represents.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 72+10+32=114. 114-45=69. Not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100. 100-45=55. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a smaller part of the molecule. Like, if the molecule is an ester, the ester group could break off. For example, an ester (RCOOR') could lose R'COO- as a fragment, leaving R-O- (like R-O+ as a fragment). Alternatively, the ester could cleave into two parts.

Wait, another possibility: if the molecule is an acyclic ester, like ethyl something, the fragment might come from the ester group. For example, in ethyl acetate, the molecular ion can break into the acetate ion (60) and the ethyl group (29), but that's not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Breaking that ring could release a fragment with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl acetal or something else. Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene, not an acetal.

Wait, another thought: the fragment m/z 45 could be an acetylenic ion (like HC≡C+), but that's 26. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about possible functional groups. The IR suggests a carbonyl and an O-H. So perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H in IR would be very broad, which could fit. The 1700 peak would be the C=O of the acid. But then, would the NMR show vinyl hydrogens? If the acid is unsaturated, like acrylic acid (CH2=CHCOOH), which has a double bond and a -COOH group. The formula for acrylic acid is C3H4O2. But our options are all C6, so maybe it's a dimer or something else.

Wait, but the options have six carbons. So perhaps the compound is a di-ester or something similar. Or maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's look at the molecular formulas and see which ones can have the functional groups indicated.

Option A: C6H12O2. This formula is similar to an ester, maybe. For example, an ester would have the formula RCOOR', with formula Cn+1+m H2n+2+2m O2. So for a six-carbon ester, say methyl pentanoate: C5H10O2. That's 5 carbons in the acid part, plus 1 in the ester. But our compound is C6H12O2. So methyl pentanoate is C6H12O2. That fits option A. So if it's an ester, then the NMR would show an ester group. But wait, the problem states that the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule must have a double bond.

Wait, so methyl pentanoate is a straight-chain ester without any double bonds. So that's a problem because the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the compound must have a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, such as methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3). Let's check the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH3 is C4H6O2. Wait, that's only four carbons. To get six, perhaps it's a longer chain. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. Hmm, which is option C.

Wait, so if the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C, then the ester group is present, and an alpha,beta-unsaturated double bond. So the IR would show the C=O at ~1700 and the conjugated C=C at ~1650. The broad peak at 3000 would be O-H, but wait, in an ester, there's no O-H group. Oh, that's a problem. Because esters don't have O-H groups. So their IR would not show a broad peak around 3000. So that suggests that the compound must have both an O-H group and a carbonyl group.

Hmm, so perhaps it's a carboxylic acid with an alkene. But then, the IR would have a broad O-H around 2500-3300, which fits the 3000 peak. And a C=O around 1700. The NMR would show the vinyl hydrogens. But the molecular formula would be something like C6H10O2. Because a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH. So for a six-carbon acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2 (since R would be C5H9 with a double bond, which would reduce the number of hydrogens). So, for example, pent-2-enoic acid: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. The formula would be C6H10O2. So that fits option C.

So in this scenario, the FTIR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) at 3000, a strong C=O at 1700, and perhaps another peak at 1650 which could be the C=C in conjugation. The NMR would show the vinyl protons as a triplet or multiplet. The mass spectrum would have a fragment at m/z 45. Let me see how that would happen.

In the case of the carboxylic acid, the molecular ion is at m/z 114 (for C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32; total 114). The fragment at 45 would come from losing some groups. For a carboxylic acid, perhaps the molecule breaks down to a smaller fragment. For example, the acid could lose CO2, but that would leave something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks between the double bond and the rest, releasing a fragment with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the esterification. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but that's not possible unless it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an ester group and an -OH group. But that's possible in some structures, like esters with hydroxyl groups elsewhere. But that would complicate the formula.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. The broad peak at 3000 could be an alcohol O-H. So maybe the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. But that would require the formula to include both an ester (O2) and an -OH (another O?), but in that case, the formula might have more oxygens. Or perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But then the IR would have a peak for the ketone (around 1700) and a broad peak for the -OH (alcohol) around 3300. But the NMR would need to have vinyl hydrogens, which would mean a double bond is present. So, the molecule would have a ketone, an alcohol group, and a double bond. The formula would need to account for that.

Let me consider the options again. Option C is C6H10O2. So that's two oxygen atoms. If the compound is a ketone with an ester group, that would require three oxygens (ketone O, ester O's), which isn't the case. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The presence of a -COOH group would require one O in the formula for the acid. But wait, the formula for a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which is R-O-OH, but that's R-O-OH, so the formula would be CnH2nO2. Wait, no. Let me think: For a carboxylic acid, the formula is CnH2nO2. If n is 6, then the formula would be C6H12O2. But wait, the compound in option A is C6H12O2, which would be a carboxylic acid with a formula like C6H12O2. But that would mean it's a saturated acid, no double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there must be a double bond. So that's a problem for option A.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. Let's see. C6H10O2 would have two oxygen atoms. A lactone is an ester, so it would have the formula CnH2nO2. For a six-membered ring (gamma-lactone), n would be 5, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a dihydroxy ketone, but that's getting a bit off track.

Wait, going back to the mass spectrum. If the fragment is at m/z 45, which is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, perhaps the compound has a diethyl group or similar. So, for example, if the compound is an ester with ethyl groups, the fragment might come from the ethyl group.

Wait, let me think of the possible structures again. The key points are:

- O-H group (broad IR at 3000)
- C=O group (IR at 1700)
- C=C (vinyl H in NMR)
- Fragment at m/z 45 in mass spec.

If the compound is a dihydroxy ester, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group and a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. For example, something like CH2=C(R)COH. But the formula would vary.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or acetal, but that usually doesn't have a strong O-H peak.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a conjugated dienol ester, but that's getting a bit too specific.

Let me try to get back to the options. If the correct formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which has two oxygens, then the structure could be an ester with a double bond and an -OH group. Wait, but that would require three oxygens (ester has two, -OH has one), unless there's a ring or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. A lactone has the formula CnH2nO2. If n=5, the formula would be C5H10O2. But our options have C6. So maybe a six-membered lactone, but that would require a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted acrylic acid. Let's say it's something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. But that would make it an ester. Wait, but then the O-H would come from where? Unless it's an alpha hydroxy ester, which can tautomerize or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the O-H could be part of a hemiacetal or acetal structure, but that would likely not show a strong O-H peak because it's more hydrogen-bonded and might appear as a broad peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol with a carbonyl group. But that would require more oxygens.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the mass spec again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32 = 72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. The fragment at 45 would be 114-45=69. So the molecule breaks into a 45 and a 69 fragment. Hmm, what could 45 be? Let's think about possible structures that would lose a 45 fragment.

Wait, for a molecule like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl hexenoate?), but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the ester group breaks off. Let me see: for ethyl acrylate, the formula is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which is C5H8O2. Its molecular weight is (5*12)+(8*1)+(2*16)=60+8+32=100. The fragment at 45 could be the ethyl group (CH2CH3) which is 29, but that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45. So if the molecule loses a (CH3)2O group, the remaining would be a fragment. But wait, (CH3)2O is 45. So if the compound is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OCH3, that's a more complex structure. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diethyl ester with a double bond, and the fragment is from the ester part. For example, diethyl something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure RC≡O, and the ion would be m/z = (R's molecular weight) + 28 (since ketene is C=O with adjacent double bond). Wait, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: the molecular formula. Let's calculate the possible degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

But the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (from IR), which are two DoU. So this option doesn't fit, unless there's a ring. For example, a ring plus a double bond. Let's say it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. Wait, but a cyclic ester (lactone) would have a ring (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), so that would require two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So that's not possible. Thus, option A is unlikely.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the compound has a carbonyl (double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), that uses up the two DoU. So the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group. But the formula is C6H10O. So it would have one O. That O could be part of a ketone and an -OH group. So the structure could be something like CH2=C(R)COH, but I'm not sure. Let me see: if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an -OH group. Wait, but that would require two O's. Because a ketone is O, and an -OH is another O. So that would be two O's, but option B has only one O. So that's a problem. Thus, option B is unlikely.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So two DoU, which can account for a carbonyl and a double bond. So the structure could be an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond and an -OH group. Wait, the formula has two O's. If it's an ester (which has two O's), then where is the -OH group? Unless it's a more complex structure, like a diester with an -OH group, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the structure could be a beta-keto ester. For example, something like CH2=C(R)COOR', which would have a carbonyl (ester) and a conjugated double bond. But then the formula would fit. But the IR would have a broad O-H peak, which an ester doesn't have. So perhaps it's a beta-keto acid or something else.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diacid ester. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, but that's getting too complicated.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So only one ring or double bond. But the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond from the vinyl, which is two DoU. So this can't fit. So option D is out.

So, based on the DoU, options A and D are out because they don't have enough DoU. Now, between B and C.

Option B: C6H10O. It has two DoU, which could fit a double bond and another (like a carbonyl). But the problem is the O count. Let's say the structure is a cyclic ketone with an -OH group. So, for example, cyclohexanone with an -OH. But that would require two O's: one for the ketone, one for the -OH. But option B has only one O. So that's impossible. So option B can't be correct.

That leaves option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So two DoU, which could be a double bond and a carbonyl. Plus, it has two O's, which could fit an ester and another O somewhere else.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A), but that can't have a double bond. So that's a problem.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2. But that's option A, which is a saturated acid. But our compound has a double bond (from NMR), so option A is out.

So perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond and an -OH group. Wait, but that would require three O's: ester has two, -OH has one. That's three O's, but the formula has only two. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diol with a carbonyl group. For example, a diol with a ketone. But that would have three O's, which again exceeds the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a hemiacetal or acetal, but that might not explain the O-H peak.

Wait, maybe the compound has an ether group and a carbonyl. So, for example, an ether and an ester. But that would require more O's.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec fragment again. If the fragment is at 45, which is (CH3)2O, perhaps the molecule has a (CH3)2O group. So maybe the compound is something like (CH3)2O connected to a carbonyl and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an acetal. For example, a compound with a structure like (CH3)2OCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. But that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the fragment (45) is C2H6O. So 45 is (CH3)2O. So if the molecule loses this group, it would leave a fragment of molecular weight 114-45=69. But I'm not sure what 69 corresponds to.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a part of the molecule that breaks off. For example, maybe the ester group breaks off as (CH3)2O, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an allyl ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C7H10O2, which is more than our options. Hmm.

I think I'm going around in circles here. Let me try to summarize:

- FTIR: broad peak at 3000 → O-H (carboxylic acid or alcohol)
- IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 → likely C=O (ester, ketone, acid) and conjugated C=C
- 1H NMR: vinyl H → double bond present
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 → possibly (CH3)2O or similar

Looking at the options, only option C (C6H10O2) has enough O's to account for a carbonyl group and possibly another functional group.

Wait, if the compound is a diethyl acetal, but that may not have O-H.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group. But how would the O count work? For example, if the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. That would have an ester (O2) and an -OH (O1), which would require three O's. But the formula is C6H10O2. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another thought: The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. If the compound is an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the IR would have the C=O around 1700 and the conjugated C=C around 1650. The O-H would have to come from somewhere. But an ester doesn't have an O-H. So perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol group elsewhere.

Wait, but if the ester is part of a cyclic structure, like a lactone, then that wouldn't have an O-H. Unless the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group, but the IR wouldn't have a broad peak for that. Phenols have broad O-H, but they usually appear around 3300, which the question says is the case. So maybe the compound has a phenol group and a carbonyl.

But then the molecular formula would have to include that. Let's see, a phenol (C6H5OH) has the formula C6H6O. But our options have C6H10O2, which is more hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a substituted cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is CH2=CHCOOH, which has the formula C9H8O2. But that doesn't match our options. But if it's a shorter chain substituted cinnamic acid, perhaps. Wait, no, our options are all C6.

Wait, maybe it's a six-membered ring with substituents. For example, a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an -OH group. But that would require more O's.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make a decision based on the data.

The IR suggests a carbonyl (1700) and a conjugated C=C (1650). The O-H is at 3000, which is broad. So it's likely a carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid with a double bond would have the formula C6H10O2.

So, if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be a part of the molecule. For a carboxylic acid, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of CO2, but that would leave a 114 -44=70, which doesn't fit 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a different cleavage.

Another thought: the fragment at 45 could be the methylene group (CH2) from the double bond, but that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the ethylene group (C2H4) is 28, but that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester with a (CH3)2O group. For example, if the structure is something like O=C-O-(CH3)2 connected via a double bond. But I'm not making progress here.

Given the time I've spent, I think the best fit is option C: C6H10O2. Because:

- It has two oxygens, which could be from an ester and another O elsewhere, but I'm not sure.
- The IR fits with a carbonyl and conjugated double bond.
- The NMR shows vinyl H.
- The degrees of unsaturation are two, matching the two double bonds (C=O and C=C).
- The fragment at 45 could be a part of the structure, maybe (CH3)2O.

So I'll go with option C.

The unknown compound's spectroscopic data provides the following key insights:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.  
   - Strong absorptions at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated C=C double bond, respectively.

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirm the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is observed. This is consistent with the molecular weight of (CH₃)₂O (45), suggesting the presence of a methoxy group or similar fragment.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula corresponds to a saturated molecule with one degree of unsaturation. However, the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond, requiring two degrees of unsaturation. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.  
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which could account for a carbonyl group and a double bond. However, it only contains one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the presence of both a carbonyl group and an O-H group. This option is also inconsistent.  
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which matches the presence of a carbonyl group and a double bond. The two oxygen atoms can account for both the carbonyl group and the O-H group. Additionally, the fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a methoxy group or similar fragment. This option aligns well with the data.  
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: This formula has one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond. This option is inconsistent with the data.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the spectroscopic data and the analysis of the molecular formulas, the compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the observed IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data, including the presence of a carbonyl group, a conjugated double bond, and the fragment at m/z = 45.
