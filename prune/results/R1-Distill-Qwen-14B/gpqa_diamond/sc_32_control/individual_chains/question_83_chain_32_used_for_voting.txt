Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titration concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D with various pH values.

Alright, first, I need to figure out what the diluted acetic acid's concentration is. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 mL, and we're adding 20 mL of water, so the total volume becomes 40 mL. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL. The final volume V2 is 40 mL (20 + 20). So, M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, that makes sense because when you double the volume, the concentration halves. So from 0.05 to 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is a neutralization reaction. The reaction would be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. So the solution would be the sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid). So, the pH at equivalence will be higher than 7.

Now, for the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence.

Let's first tackle the 25% titration point. That means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Wait, but how much volume of NaOH is added at 25% titration? Hmm, perhaps I can find the volume needed for equivalence first, then take 25% of that.

Calculating the equivalence point:

The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The diluted solution is 40 mL (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. The reaction is 1:1 (1 mole of acetic acid reacts with 1 mole of NaOH), so moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles. The volume of NaOH required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added.

At 25% titration, that's 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added or the moles reacted. Since the question says 25% titration, I think it refers to the moles of acid that have reacted. So in 25%, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So, at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's model the solution.

The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from the diluted solution). When 25% is titrated, 0.00025 moles have reacted, so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion produced is 0.00025.

The total volume of the solution now is the initial 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) plus the 2.5 mL NaOH added. So total volume is 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution, so using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be appropriate. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, log(1e-5) is -5, so pKa = 4.733 (since 1.85e-5 is 10^(-4.733)).

So pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Which is roughly 4.26. So that's one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the volume. Let me double-check.

Wait, the total volume when 2.5 mL of NaOH is added. The original solution is 40 mL, and adding 2.5 mL gives 42.5 mL. So yes, that part was correct.

Wait, another approach: Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the concentration using moles and the new volume.

But wait, I think I did that correctly. So perhaps the pH at 25% is around 4.26. Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions. The moles of acetate would be 0.001, and the volume is 40 mL plus 10 mL (since equivalence is at 10 mL NaOH), so 50 mL total volume.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base, so the solution will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The hydrolysis reaction can be set up as:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assume x is the [OH^-] produced.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be negligible compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ ?

Calculating log(3.288e-6): log(3.288) is about 0.517, so pOH = 5.483. So pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.

So approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Let's check the options again.

Option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that's one possibility. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence calculation.

Wait, another approach: Wait, when you have a sodium acetate solution, the pH can be found using the hydrolysis equation. Let me think again.

The acetate ion (A^-) in water:

A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-

The Kb is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration of A^- is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, [A^-] = 0.02 - x, [HA] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 → [OH^-] = 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let's compute that more accurately.

Log(3.288) is about 0.517. So log(3.288e-6) is 5.517? Wait wait, no. Wait, 3.288e-6 is 3.288 * 10^-6. So log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) = 0.517 + (-6) = -5.483. So pOH is 5.483. pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So about 8.52.

So the equivalence point is around 8.52, which matches option A. But wait, the options also have other equivalence points. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration part. Because when you're at 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is less than at equivalence. Let me recheck the 25% calculation.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the pH during the titration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly.

So, moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted, so moles of acetate formed is 0.00025. Remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

The total volume is 40 mL (original solution) + 2.5 mL (NaOH added) = 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733.

log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ) → 0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 → approximately 4.26.

So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So option A is the one that matches.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid with water, the concentration decreases, but the pH of the diluted solution would be higher than the original, because diluting a weak acid makes it less strong, so it's less dissociated.

Wait, but in our case, the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Let me calculate its pH before any titration, just to confirm.

For 0.025 M CH3COOH, Ka is 1.85e-5.

The dissociation is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

Using the approximation: [H+] = sqrt( Ka * C ) = sqrt(1.85e-5 * 0.025).

Calculate that: 1.85e-5 * 0.025 = 4.625e-7.

Square root: approx 6.8e-4.

pH = -log(6.8e-4) = approx 3.17.

Wait, so the initial pH of the diluted solution is around 3.17. So when we start titrating, the initial pH is 3.17, and as we add NaOH, the pH increases.

But in our 25% titration, the pH is about 4.26, which makes sense because it's higher than the initial pH.

So that seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 3.17 and 6.73. Hmm, that's the initial pH and something else, but the question is about 25% titration.

So, I think option A is correct.

But wait, another thing: sometimes, when you reach the equivalence point, the solution is not just the sodium acetate, but also considering any activity coefficients or other effects. But in a school problem, we can assume it's just the hydrolysis of acetate.

Wait, another thought: maybe I made a mistake in considering the total volume. Let me double-check.

At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 mL, so the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL.

Wait, but in the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach, I used the concentrations correctly. So I think that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added relative to the equivalence point volume. Since the equivalence point is 10 mL, 25% of that is 2.5 mL. So that's correct.

So, the pH at 25% is about 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. So why is that?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me recompute [A^-]/[HA].

Moles of A^-: 0.00025 mol.

Moles of HA: 0.00075 mol.

Concentration of A^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M.

Concentration of HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) = -0.477.

pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is about 4.26.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check for errors in other parts. What about the equivalence point pH?

Wait, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

Calculating Kb:

Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is [OH^-], then:

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02) → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → 5.483. So pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52.

So that's correct.

So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52. Therefore, the correct option is A: 4.26; 8.52.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L), and its concentration is 0.05 M. After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = M \cdot V = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid reacts with NaOH, requiring the same number of moles of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. This corresponds to 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. The moles of acetic acid reacted are:

\[
\text{Moles reacted} = 0.25 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles unreacted} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are equal to the moles of acetic acid reacted, which is 0.00025 moles. The total volume of the solution at 25% titration is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{\text{Moles unreacted}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ion. The moles of acetate ion are 0.001, and the total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.517 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. The correct option is:

**Answer: A**
