Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each part involves.

First, when you dilute a solution, you have to calculate the new concentration. So the initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then you add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). So the concentration after dilution would be half of the original, right? Because you're doubling the volume.

So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, because 0.05 divided by 2 is 0.025.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So the moles of acetic acid are Molarity * Volume, which is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then when you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. But since the question asks for pH at 25% titration and equivalence point, I think I need to handle each separately.

Let's first find the pH at 25% titration. So, 25% of the way to the equivalence point.

Wait, how much NaOH is added at 25%? Let me calculate the total volume of NaOH needed for equivalence first.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I already calculated that earlier. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, diluted solution is 0.025 M in acetic acid, and the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles of acetic acid are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So, yes, that's correct.

So the equivalence point requires adding 0.001 moles of NaOH, since the reaction is 1:1.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So, the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. Therefore, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, of the 0.001 moles of acetic acid, 0.00025 moles have reacted with NaOH.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the situation in terms of concentrations after adding that amount of NaOH.

Let me think. The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. When we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

So, that's 0.00025 moles of NaOH reacting with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. The reaction would produce 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, in the solution, we have:

Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 moles.

Moles reacted: 0.00025 → moles remaining: 0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025.

Now, the total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is the initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let's compute pKa.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73 (because log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733).

So, pH = 4.73 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Wait, that's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26, so that's close. But wait, let me be precise with calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 25e-6 / 42.5e-3 = 25e-6 / 4.25e-2 = (25 / 4.25) * 1e-4 = approx 5.882e-3 M.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 75e-6 / 4.25e-2 = 75/(425) * 1e-3 → 75/425 is 0.17647, so 0.17647e-3 → 0.00017647 M.

So, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (5.882e-3) / (0.017647) → wait no, wait, no, [A^-] is 5.882e-3 M, and [HA] is 0.017647 M? Wait no, wait that can't be right. Wait, 0.00075 moles is 0.00075 divided by 0.0425 L is 0.017647 M? No, 0.00075 is 7.5e-4, divided by 0.0425 (4.25e-2) → 7.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (7.5 /425) * 1e-2 → 0.017647 M. Yes. And [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 → which is 0.333333.

So log(0.3333) is exactly log(1/3) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, so approximately 4.25. So the pH at 25% titration is about 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26, which is very close. Option D is 4.57, which is higher, so that can't be the 25% point. So maybe option A is a candidate.

But wait, let me make sure. Another approach: perhaps the dilution affects the initial concentration.

Wait, another way to think about the 25% point. Alternatively, let's model the situation using the initial concentrations and the buffer equation correctly.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of moles.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After diluting with 20 cm³ H2O, volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.025 M.

Then, when 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added, moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025.

So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So, [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation:

pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → which is the same as before, 4.73 + log(0.333...) → 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So pH is approximately 4.25.

So, the first part (25% titration) gives pH ≈ 4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26.

Now, the second part: equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

So, moles of NaOH added would equal moles of acetic acid. So, 0.001 mol of NaOH added.

Which is 0.001 / 0.1 M = 0.01 L → 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, the solution at equivalence point contains 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- (acetate ions) in a total volume of 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), so in solution, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw = Ka * Kb → Kb = Kw / Ka.

Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, using the Kb to find the pH. Since Kb is very small, we can assume that the hydrolysis doesn't proceed much, so we can approximate [OH^-] using the formula:

Kb ≈ [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then:

Kb ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x) → since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

So, x^2 / 0.02 ≈ Kb → x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02).

Calculating:

5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486.

So, pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514.

Wait, but wait, option A has equivalence pH as 8.52, which is very close to this.

So, putting it together: 25% titration pH ≈4.25, equivalence pH≈8.51.

Which matches option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation or the subsequent steps.

Let me double-check the Kb:

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Then, Kb = 5.405e-10.

At equivalence point, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02) → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6. pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.5168, so log(3.288e-6) is 5.4832 → pOH ≈5.483, pH = 14-5.483=8.517.

So, pH at equivalence is about 8.52, matching option A's second value.

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other factors I may have missed? For instance, activity coefficients, but at this level, we probably ignore that and proceed with the basic approach.

So, putting it all together, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, and at equivalence, around 8.52. Looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → this matches.

But wait, another option is D: 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, that seems way off for the equivalence point. So A must be the correct choice.

But wait, wait—did I perhaps miscalculate the pH at equivalence point? Because sometimes in the case of acetate, the pH at equivalence is higher than 7, but I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, wait, but another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the acetate solution is 0.02 M, but perhaps I should consider the exact solution for the quadratic equation.

Wait, the Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Let me let x = [OH^-]. Then, [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x. But since Kb is so small, x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02. So, x²/(0.02) = 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = 3.288e-6, as before. So, same result.

Alternatively, another approach: since the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH should be basic, so around 8.5 sounds correct.

Wait, but let me think again about the 25% titration. I calculated the pH as approximately 4.25, which is very close to option A. But what about the other options?

Looking at the options, option D is 4.57; 6.92. I don't think so because 4.57 is higher than the initial pH after dilution, which was around 2.9 or something. Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the pH of the diluted solution before any titration.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. The pH of a 0.025 M acetic acid can be estimated using the formula for weak acids:

Ka = [H+][A^-]/[HA] → assuming [H+] = x, and [A^-] = x, [HA] ≈ 0.025.

So, Ka = x² / 0.025 → x² = 1.85e-5 * 0.025 → 4.625e-7 → x ≈ 6.8e-4 → pH = 3.17.

Ah, so the initial pH after dilution is about 3.17, which is one of the options (option B's first value is 3.17, but the second is 6.73, which doesn't match the equivalence point I found). So, the initial pH is 3.17, which is lower than the 25% titration pH of 4.25. That makes sense because adding base would increase the pH.

So, going back, the 25% point is pH ~4.25, and equivalence is ~8.52. Which corresponds to option A.

But wait, another thought—could the equivalence point's pH be calculated using another approach? Because sometimes when you have a weak acid and a strong base, the equivalence solution is a solution of the conjugate base, and so we use Kb as I did.

Yes, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are correct, and the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are 0.00025. The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. These values match **Option A**.

Answer: A
