Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring, considering relativistic effects. Oh right, it's a 1D problem, so that might simplify things a bit.

So the setup is a harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. But wait, since it's relativistic, I can't just use the classical formulas; I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, that's non-relativistic. The question is relativistic, so C can't be the answer.

Relativistically, energy considerations change. The total energy should include relativistic kinetic energy. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, and in the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)kx² perhaps? Or does that change?

Wait, the potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kx² even in relativity, I think. But the kinetic energy is different. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential, which would be (gamma -1)mc² + (1/2)kx². But at maximum displacement x = A, the velocity v is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA² = (gamma_max -1)mc² + (1/2)kA²? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when x is maximum, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero.

Wait, the total energy E must be at maximum when the oscillator is at x=0, because that's when the velocity is maximum. So when x=0, all energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma_max -1) mc². But also, E is the potential energy at x=A, which is (1/2)kA². So (gamma_max -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but gamma is a function of velocity. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when the velocity is maximum, that's when the kinetic energy is maximum, and that's when x=0. So E is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. Wait, no, at x=0, potential is zero, so kinetic is maximum. But the total energy E is the same throughout the cycle.

So the energy at x=A is purely potential: E = (1/2) k A².

At x=0, the energy is purely kinetic: E = (gamma -1) m c².

So setting them equal: (gamma -1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So gamma = [ (1/2 k A²) / (m c²) ) ] + 1.

Hmm, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can set up the equation:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me rearrange this. Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

Hmm, let's compute 1 - v²/c²:

1 - (v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^(-2).

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let me say (k A²)/(2 m c²) = s. So equation becomes:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + s)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + s)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + s)^2.

Factor that,

v²/c² = [ (1 + s)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + s)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2s + s² - 1 ) = 2s + s².

So,

v²/c² = (2s + s²) / (1 + s)^2.

Factor numerator:

s (2 + s) / (1 + s)^2.

But given s is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is probably small because in classical cases, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write v_max as c * sqrt( [2s + s²] ) / (1 + s)^2 )? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can express v_max as c multiplied by sqrt( (something) ).

Let me compute the numerator:

2s + s² = s (2 + s).

Denominator: (1 + s)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ s (2 + s) ] / (1 + s)^2.

Taking square root,

v/c = sqrt( s (2 + s) ) / (1 + s).

Wait, but s is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute back.

s = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me compute 2 + s:

2 + s = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) = (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute the expression we have for v²/c².

v²/c² = [ (2s + s²) ] / (1 + s)^2.

Which is [ s (2 + s) ] / (1 + s)^2.

Wait, but s = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So 2 + s = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for v_max in terms of gamma.

Wait, from the earlier equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

And gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ].

Take reciprocal,

v²/c² = [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Wait, that's the same as what I had before. So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + s)^2 -1 ] / (1 + s)^2,

where s = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2s + s²) -1 = 2s + s².

So,

v²/c² = (2s + s²)/(1 + s)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2s + s²) ) / (1 + s ).

But s is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug that in.

s = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

2s = (k A²)/(m c²).

s^2 = (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

2s + s^2 = (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Factor out (k A²)/(4 m² c^4):

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out (k A²)/(m c²):

But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of s.

Wait, perhaps factor (2s + s²) as s(2 + s).

Hmm, but that's what I had earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps this can be written as:

sqrt( (2s + s^2) ) = sqrt( s (2 + s) )

Hmm. Not sure. Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2s + s².

Denominator: (1 + s)^2 = 1 + 2s + s².

So,

v²/c² = (2s + s²)/(1 + 2s + s²) = [ s (2 + s) ] / (1 + s)^2.

But not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps the options can be manipulated to match this form. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, that's a bit different. Let me compute what's inside.

1 + [1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))]^2.

Hmm, that's 1 + [1/( (2m -kA²)/(2m) )]^2 = 1 + [2m/(2m -kA²)]^2.

Not sure if that's right.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c²))).

Wait, but inside the sqrt, it's 1 + 1/[ (1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) ].

Which is 1 + [1/(1 - s')], where s' is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, inside the sqrt, 1 - [1/(1 + s')^2 ].

Which is exactly the expression we have for v²/c².

Because earlier, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + s')^2 ].

So, v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + s')^2 )

Wait, yes! Because we have v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + s')².

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, so option D is the correct one. Let me double-check.

Yes, our derivation led us to v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + s')²], so v_max is c times the square root of that.

Looking at the options:

Option D is written as v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))² )

Which is exactly what we derived. So yes, option D is correct.

So the answer must be D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must consider relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

1. **Relating Total Energy**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic:  
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Equating these, we get:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we have:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal:  
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
