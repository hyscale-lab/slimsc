Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but the state given is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the expectation values won't necessarily be the same as the eigenvalues of P_z. I'll need to compute them using the state vector and the matrix for P_z.

Looking at the problem, the state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [a; b; c], where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

The matrix for P_z is given as:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is calculated as ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Let me compute ⟨P_z⟩:
⟨P_z⟩ = a*(ħ a) + b*(0 * b) + c*(-ħ c)
= ħ a² + 0 + (-ħ c²)
But wait, a is (-1/2), so a squared is (1/4). Similarly, c is (-1/2), so c squared is also 1/4.
So plugging in:
= ħ (1/4) + (-ħ) (1/4)
= (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) = 0.

Hmm, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting. Now I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩.

P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element because it's diagonal. So P_z² is:
[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ( -ħ )^2 ] ]
Which simplifies to:
[ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, ħ²] ]

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, since the matrix is diagonal, this is:
a² * ħ² + b² * 0 + c² * ħ²
= (a² + c²) * ħ²

Wait, a and c are both (-1/2), so a² and c² are each 1/4.
So (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches what I got. So I think the answer is B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the observable $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = a \cdot \hbar a + b \cdot 0 \cdot b + c \cdot (-\hbar) c,
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 0 + (-\hbar) \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \hbar \frac{1}{4} - \hbar \frac{1}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = a^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + b^2 \cdot 0 + c^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
