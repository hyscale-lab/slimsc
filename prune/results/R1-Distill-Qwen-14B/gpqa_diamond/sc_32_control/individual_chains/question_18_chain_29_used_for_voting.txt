Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Let me read the question carefully.

So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the mass matters for this particular question because it's about elemental abundances, which probably relates more to nucleosynthesis and not so much the star's structure unless it's about something like where the elements come from in their formation. But maybe I'm wrong, but for now, I'll proceed.

The given data is about elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. They've given me [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

And the photospheric composition of the Sun is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, so log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait, wait. Wait the question says: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 => log(nMg/nH)= -5. So nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Wait, wait. Let me just clarify the Sun's composition.

Sun's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, [nMg/H] is log(nMg/nH) =7 -12 =-5. So nMg/nH is 1e-5, and nFe/nH is 1e-4.5.

So, the task is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. The ratio is n_Si1 / n_Si2.

I need to find [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star, but how does that connect to the ratio of silicon?

Wait, [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Alternatively, [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) = log( (nX/nY) ) - log( nX_sun/nY_sun )

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means:

log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1 ) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

Similarly, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe1 / n_H1 ) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) = 0.

So, log(n_Fe1 / n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun )

Which implies that n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So, for Star_1, the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's. So, [Fe/H]=0 implies that the iron to hydrogen ratio is solar. So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0, so log(n_Mg2/n_H2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ), so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

So, for each star, their Fe and Mg are at solar abundance relative to H, but perhaps their Si and Mg are different.

Let me process Star_1 first.

Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So,

log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1 ) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

We know n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun is 10^{ [Si/Fe]_sun }, but what is [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, in the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) =0, so Fe is solar. Similarly, for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ). So, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? Wait, wait. Let's calculate.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun /n_Y_sun )

So, for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - [Si/Fe]_sun = 0.3.

But [Si/Fe]_sun is zero, so log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3.

So, n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Wait, 10^0.3 is about 2, right? 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, n_Si1 = 2 * n_Fe1.

But for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun )

Wait, no, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) =0.

So, log(n_Fe1/n_H1 )= log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ), so n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Similarly, for the Sun, n_Fe_sun = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H_sun. Wait, no, the Sun's n_Fe is just (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H_sun, which is (n_Fe_sun) = 1e-4.5 as I calculated earlier.

Wait, maybe I should express all the abundances in terms of the Sun's.

Let me outline the steps.

For each element X in each star, n_X = (n_X_sun / n_H_sun ) * [10^([X/H]_star ) ] * n_H.

Wait, no. Let me think differently.

In the Sun:

n_Fe_sun = (1e7.5 ) / 1e12? Wait, wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5.

So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5.

So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg in the Sun, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, in the Sun, the number densities are:

n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun

n_Mg_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun

n_Si_sun is not given. Hmm. Wait, but I might need to find [Si/Fe]_sun, but I don't think it's given. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] to find the ratio.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

So, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) * 10^{0.3} * n_Fe1.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the fractions in each star.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.

So, n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1 ) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) =0.3.

But log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) = [Si/Fe]_sun, which is zero. So:

log(n_Si1 /n_Fe1 ) = 0.3 → n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3} ≈ 2 * n_Fe1.

So, n_Si1 ≈ 2 n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

So, n_Si1 = 2 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

Similarly, for the Sun, n_Si_sun = (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * n_Fe_sun.

Wait, but what's the [Si/Fe]_sun? It's zero, right? Because [X/Y] is relative to the Sun. So, [Si/Fe]_sun = 0.

So, n_Si_sun = n_Fe_sun * 10^{0} = n_Fe_sun.

Wait, but that can't be right because in reality, the Sun has more Fe than Si, but perhaps in this problem, it's assumed that [Si/Fe]_sun is zero. Maybe we can just proceed with the given data.

Wait, but the ratio of [Si/Fe]_sun is not given, so perhaps I don't need it. Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of Si to Fe in each star, and then find the ratio of Si in each star, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at Star_2 as well.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2 ) =0.3 + [Mg/Si]_sun.

[Mg/Si]_sun is zero, so log(n_Mg2/n_Si2 )=0.3 → n_Mg2 = n_Si2 *10^{0.3} ≈2 n_Si2.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2.

So, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2.

Putting together:

n_Mg2 =n_Si2 *2 → n_Si2 = n_Mg2 /2 = [ (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2 ] / 2.

So, n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun / (2 n_H_sun )) *n_H2.

Hmm. So, now I have expressions for n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of their respective stars' hydrogen.

But how do I find the ratio n_Si1 /n_Si2?

Wait, maybe I can express both in terms of the Sun's parameters and the stars' hydrogen.

Let me write:

n_Si1 = 2 *n_Fe1 = 2 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun / (2 n_H_sun )) *n_H2.

Wait, because n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2, and n_Si2 = n_Mg2 /2.

So, n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun / (2 n_H_sun )) *n_H2.

Now, the ratio is (n_Si1 ) / (n_Si2 ) = [2*(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_Mg_sun/(2n_H_sun )) *n_H2 ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ 2*(n_Fe_sun ) *n_H1 /n_H_sun ] / [ (n_Mg_sun *n_H2 )/(2n_H_sun) ) ]

= [ 2 n_Fe_sun n_H1 /n_H_sun ] * [ 2n_H_sun / (n_Mg_sun n_H2 ) ]

= (4 n_Fe_sun n_H1 ) / (n_Mg_sun n_H2 )

But I don't have information about the hydrogen in each star (n_H1 and n_H2) compared to the Sun. Hmm.

Wait, but since the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, perhaps the hydrogen in each star is the same as the Sun's? Or maybe the total number of atoms is adjusted accordingly. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in each star, the abundance is relative to hydrogen, which is the same as the Sun's. But wait, no, because the stars have different masses, but that might not affect the composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of silicon in the stars is independent of the total hydrogen because the [X/H] is given, which is the log of (X/H) relative to the Sun. So, maybe the n_H in each star is the same as the Sun's? That doesn't make sense because the star's total hydrogen could vary.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the abundances.

In Star_1:

n_Si1 = 2 *n_Fe1.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

So, n_Si1 = 2 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

In Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg2 ) /2.

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2.

So, n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun / (2 n_H_sun )) *n_H2.

So, the ratio is (n_Si1) / (n_Si2 ) = [2 (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) n_H1 ] / [ (n_Mg_sun/(2 n_H_sun )) n_H2 ]

Simplify:

= [ 2 * n_Fe_sun *n_H1 /n_H_sun ] * [ 2 n_H_sun / (n_Mg_sun n_H2 ) ]

= (4 n_Fe_sun n_H1 ) / (n_Mg_sun n_H2 )

Hmm, but without knowing the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2, I can't proceed. Wait, but perhaps the question is about the ratio in terms of the Sun's composition, assuming that the stars have the same overall hydrogen abundance as the Sun. Or perhaps I can assume that n_H1 = n_H_sun and n_H2 =n_H_sun. That would make the ratio (4 n_Fe_sun ) / ( n_Mg_sun ) )

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the Sun's composition.

In the Sun, n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 (because [Fe/H]_sun is 7.5-12=-4.5).

n_Mg_sun =1e-5.

So, n_Fe_sun = 3.16e-5, n_Mg_sun =1e-5.

Wait, let me compute the ratio:

(4 * n_Fe_sun ) / (n_Mg_sun )

=4 * (3.16e-5) / (1e-5) ) =4 *3.16 ≈12.64.

Wait, that's option B, which is ~12.6.

But wait, why would n_H1 and n_H2 equal n_H_sun? Because in the stars, the hydrogen could be different. Oh, but perhaps in the stars, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, which implies that Fe and Mg are at solar abundance relative to H. But the total H could vary, but when considering the ratios, maybe the H cancels out.

Wait, in that case, perhaps the ratio of n_Si1 /n_Si2 is (4 n_Fe_sun ) / (n_Mg_sun ), because n_H1 and n_H2 cancel out. Because in the ratio:

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = [4 n_Fe_sun n_H1] / [n_Mg_sun n_H2 ].

But if the stars have the same H as the Sun, then n_H1 =n_H_sun and n_H2 =n_H_sun, so n_H1 /n_H2 =1, and the ratio becomes 4 n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun.

But wait, that would require that n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun are known.

In the Sun, n_Fe_sun = 10^(-4.5) ≈3.16e-5.

n_Mg_sun =1e-5.

So, 4 *3.16e-5 /1e-5 =4*3.16=12.64.

Which is option B (~12.6).

But wait, let me think again. Why would the ratio of H in the two stars affect this? Because the stars could have different H abundances, but the question doesn't state anything about that. So perhaps the assumption is that the star's H is the same as the Sun's. Or perhaps the H cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, another approach: since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun ), right? Because [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe/n_H ) - log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2= (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2.

So, the ratio of silicon is n_Si1 /n_Si2 = (2 n_Fe1 ) / (n_Mg2 /2 ) = 4 n_Fe1 /n_Mg2.

Substituting n_Fe1 and n_Mg2:

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 =4 [(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2 ].

=4 * (n_Fe_sun *n_H1 )/(n_Mg_sun *n_H2 )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, we can't compute this. Hmm, but that's a problem because the options are numbers.

Wait, perhaps the H in each star is the same as the Sun's. So, n_H1 =n_H_sun, n_H2 =n_H_sun → ratio becomes 4 *n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun.

With n_Fe_sun=1e-4.5, n_Mg_sun=1e-5.

1e-4.5 is 3.16e-5, so 4 *3.16e-5 /1e-5 =4*3.16=12.64, which is option B.

So I think the answer is B.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships provided.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex:  
     \[
     \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Fe1}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}\right)
     \]  
     Since [Si/Fe]_sun = 0, this simplifies to:  
     \[
     \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Fe1}}}\right) = 0.3 \implies \frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Fe1}}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
     \]  
     Thus, \( n_{\text{Si1}} = 2 \cdot n_{\text{Fe1}} \).

   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex:  
     \[
     \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Fe1}}}{n_{\text{H1}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right)
     \]  
     This implies \( n_{\text{Fe1}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{H1}} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex:  
     \[
     \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg2}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}}\right) = 0.3 + \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}\right)
     \]  
     Since [Mg/Si]_sun = 0, this simplifies to:  
     \[
     \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg2}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}}\right) = 0.3 \implies \frac{n_{\text{Mg2}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
     \]  
     Thus, \( n_{\text{Si2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg2}}}{2} \).

   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex:  
     \[
     \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg2}}}{n_{\text{H2}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right)
     \]  
     This implies \( n_{\text{Mg2}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{H2}} \).

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \implies n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \implies n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{2 \cdot n_{\text{Fe1}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Mg2}}}{2}} = \frac{4 \cdot n_{\text{Fe1}}}{n_{\text{Mg2}}}
\]

Substitute \( n_{\text{Fe1}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{H1}} \) and \( n_{\text{Mg2}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{H2}} \):  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{4 \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{H1}}}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot n_{\text{H2}}}
\]

Assuming \( n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{H, sun}} \), the ratio simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{4 \cdot n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}
\]

From the Sun's composition:  
- \( n_{\text{Fe, sun}} = 10^{-4.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \),
- \( n_{\text{Mg, sun}} = 10^{-5} \).

Substitute these values:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{4 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-5}}{10^{-5}} = 4 \cdot 3.16 = 12.64
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
