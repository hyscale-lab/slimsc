Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not entirely sure how to tackle it. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a given Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The problem also gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constants, right. They tell us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So, I'm thinking about the reaction here. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed when Ca²+ and EDTA (in its deprotonated form) combine. The reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10. 

Since the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex ion. The question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions. Oh right, because in a complex, the metal ion is tied up, so the free ion concentration is what we're after.

I remember the formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this problem, it's given that the pH is ideal. So, I think that under ideal pH, EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the total EDTA concentration minus the part that's complexed. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the total concentration of EDTA in solution is from the complex and any free EDTA. But wait, the problem might not give me the free EDTA concentration. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Then, because the complex dissociates a little bit, releasing Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, no, wait. The complex is stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. But we're to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution. So, using the formation constant equation.

Let me write the equation again. K = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10.

Given that, what are the concentrations of [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-]?

But wait, the total concentration of EDTA in solution is from the dissociation of the complex. Wait, no, the solution has 0.02 M of the complex, which is CaEDTA^2−. So, if the complex doesn't dissociate much, [CaEDTA^2−] is approximately 0.02 M.

Wait, but that's only an assumption. Let me think. The problem says it's a 0.02 M solution of the complex, and we're to find the concentration of calcium ions in solution.

But wait, the dissociation of the complex is: CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, because each mole of complex produces one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x.

But wait, the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2−], would be approximately 0.02 M - x. But since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation is very small, so x must be very small, and 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, [CaEDTA^2−] ≈ 0.02 M.

So, putting it into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So, solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 2/(5e13) = 4e-15.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, wait. 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, 4e-13 is 4*10^-13, so the square root is 2 *10^-6.5. Wait, 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So, 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

So, x is about 6.3e-7 M. Let me check the options. Option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I got all the steps right.

We assumed that the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M because K is so large, so the dissociation is minimal. So, [CaEDTA] is about 0.02 M.

Then, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So, K = (0.02)/(x²) = 5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12) = approx 4.47e-6. Wait, wait, no:

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x²=4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7.

Ah, I see. So x is 6.32e-7 M, which matches option C: 6.3e-7.

I think that's right. So the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \( x \). Since each mole of the complex dissociates into one mole of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and one mole of \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \), the concentration of \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) is also \( x \). The concentration of the complex \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \) is approximately 0.02 M, as the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
