Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my SMEFT, but let's think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1,2,3,4, and the choices are combinations of these.

First, let me remember what each symmetry means. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations, right? So if something respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, operators in SMEFT are usually considered in a theory that's Lorentz invariant but not necessarily Poincaré, because SMEFT is typically constructed in a fixed frame, maybe? Or does SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry? Hmm, wait no, because SMEFT is a effective theory valid below a certain scale, and the Poincaré symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes momentum conservation. But I'm not sure. Maybe SMEFT respects Lorentz but not necessarily Poincaré because operators can have different scaling with momenta? Or perhaps the operators are constructed in a way that they respect both Lorentz and Poincaré? I'm a bit confused here.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. SMEFT operators usually don't have to respect CP symmetry, right? Because in the Standard Model, CP is not exactly a symmetry (like in the CKM matrix), but in SMEFT, you can have operators that break CP. So I think operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP. So option 3 wouldn't be a required symmetry.

CPT symmetry is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. The theory must respect CPT symmetry because it's tied to the existence of antiparticles and other fundamental aspects. So any operator in a valid QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be respected.

Wait, so let's go back. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. SMEFT is an effective field theory that respects Lorentz symmetry, right? Because it's built from the Standard Model which is Lorentz invariant. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincaré?

Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. SMEFT is usually considered in a particular frame, perhaps, because it's an effective theory below the cutoff. So operators can have terms that violate Poincaré symmetry? Or do they respect it? Hmm, I remember that in SMEFT, you can have operators with different scaling dimensions, but all terms in the Lagrangian should respect Lorentz symmetry. But Poincaré symmetry would require, for instance, momentum conservation, which is tied to translation invariance. But effective theories are usually constructed in a way that respects translation symmetry, so the Lagrangian is local and translation invariant. So perhaps SMEFT respects Poincaré symmetry. Or maybe not, because the effective theory is valid up to a certain scale, and when considering higher scales, non-Poincaré aspects might come in. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations, so if the theory respects Lorentz and is local, then it must respect Poincaré. Wait, but perhaps SMEFT is formulated in a way that doesn't have to respect translations because it's non-renormalizable. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must. Poincaré includes Lorentz and translation. So if the theory is translation invariant, then Poincaré is respected. But I'm not sure if SMEFT requires translation symmetry. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's constructed in terms of local operators, so translation symmetry is probably included. So operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, hence Poincaré (2) is also a symmetry that must be respected. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but wait a minute. SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM plus higher-dimensional operators. The SM respects Poincaré symmetry, so the effective theory should too. Because the SM is a Poincaré-invariant theory, and the SMEFT is an extension of it. So all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

But earlier, I thought that Poincaré is automatically respected if Lorentz is, but that's not exactly right. Poincaré includes translations, so if the theory respects translations, then yes. SMEFT does respect translations because it's a local theory—so the operators are local, so Poincaré must be respected.

So 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, about CP symmetry. As I thought earlier, SMEFT allows for operators that break CP, so not all operators have to respect it. So 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry (4) must be respected because any quantum field theory must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

Wait, but wait. In SMEFT, I think the operators are constructed to be CPT-invariant. Because when you write down the operators, you have to make sure that they are Hermitian, which usually ensures that CPT is respected. But wait, CPT symmetry is a separate condition. For example, if the operator has a certain structure, like including a certain combination of fields that ensures CPT invariance. But is it possible to have operators that break CPT in SMEFT? No, because that would violate the principles of quantum field theory. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The point is, in any QFT, all terms in the Lagrangian must respect CPT symmetry. So in SMEFT, which is a QFT, all operators must respect CPT. Therefore, 4 is correct.

So let's recap:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected by all operators. Yes.

2. Poincaré symmetry: Which includes translation and Lorentz. So must be respected. Yes.

3. CP symmetry: Not necessarily, because some operators can break CP. No.

4. CPT symmetry: Must be respected. Yes.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I thought that in SMEFT, the operators are written as local operators, so they must be Poincaré invariant. Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense. So 2 is correct.

But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT.

Another angle: does the SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry? Because the Poincaré group includes translations. In the SMEFT framework, the theory is built in a way that is invariant under Lorentz transformations, but I'm not certain about translations. Wait, translations are part of the Poincaré group, so if the theory is translation-invariant, then yes. But is the SMEFT Lagrangian translation-invariant?

I think it is, because the SMEFT is a local effective field theory. So the Lagrangian is a function of the fields and their derivatives, without any explicit dependence on position, which ensures translation invariance. So Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.

Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 (Lorentz, Poincare, CPT). So option C.

Wait, but wait another point. Are all operators in SMEFT automatically CPT-invariant? Or do they have to be constructed to be so? Because in SMEFT, operators are usually written as Hermitian, which in many cases ensures CPT invariance, but maybe not always. Or perhaps in SMEFT, all dimension-6 operators are required to be CPT-invariant. For example, in the SM, all terms are CPT-invariant, so in SMEFT, which is an extension, the same holds.

So the correct answer would have 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

So the correct answer is C: 1,2,4.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine the correct answer, let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, as it is built from the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must therefore respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. SMEFT is a local effective field theory, meaning its Lagrangian is translation-invariant and does not depend explicitly on position. Thus, SMEFT respects Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a fundamental requirement for SMEFT operators. Some operators in SMEFT can explicitly break CP symmetry, as the SM itself does not respect CP symmetry in all cases (e.g., due to CP violation in the CKM matrix). Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory (QFT) and must be respected by any valid QFT, including SMEFT. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.
