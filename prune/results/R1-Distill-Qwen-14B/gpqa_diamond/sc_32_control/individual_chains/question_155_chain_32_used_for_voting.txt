Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in Pz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. The uncertainty is ΔPz, which I know is calculated using the formula ΔPz = sqrt(<Pz²> - <Pz>²). So I need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

First, let's understand the setup. The operators Px, Py, and Pz are given in matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state given is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of Px. Hmm, that's interesting because it's not aligned with the basis we're working in.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write this down. So the state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Since it's in the eigenbasis of Pz, each component corresponds directly to the eigenvalues of Pz. So the possible eigenvalues for Pz are ħ, 0, -ħ, because looking at Pz's matrix:

Pz has first row [ħ, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-ħ]. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the state ψ is a superposition of these eigenstates.

Wait, no. The state is given in the Pz eigenbasis, so the components are the coefficients for each eigenstate of Pz. So the state is a linear combination of |+> (eigenstate with +ħ), |0> (eigenstate 0), and |-> (eigenstate -ħ).

The components are: first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for |+>, second component 1/sqrt(2) for |0>, and third component -1/2 for |->.

So to find <Pz>, which is the expectation value, I just multiply each component by its corresponding eigenvalue and sum them up. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues.

So <Pz> = ( (-1/2) * ħ ) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 ) + ( (-1/2) * (-ħ) )

Let me compute that:

(-1/2)ħ + 0 + (1/2)ħ = [ (-1/2 + 1/2) ] ħ = 0. So <Pz> is zero.

Now I need to find <Pz²>. Since Pz squared is the operator Pz multiplied by itself, but in terms of expectation value, for eigenstates, when you square the operator, each eigenvalue is squared.

Wait, but let me think. The eigenvalues of Pz are ±ħ and 0. So when you square them, you get (ħ^2), 0, (ħ^2). So Pz squared acting on each eigenstate |+>, |0>, |-> will give (ħ²)|+>, 0|0>, (ħ²)|->.

So the expectation value <Pz²> is the same as the expectation value of Pz squared, which is the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities.

Wait no, more accurately, since each component is the amplitude, the expectation value is sum |amplitude|^2 * (eigenvalue)^2.

Because for each basis state, the probability is |c_i|^2, where c_i is the coefficient. So:

<Pz²> = |(-1/2)|² * (ħ)^2 + |(1/sqrt(2))|² * (0)^2 + |(-1/2)|² * (ħ)^2

Compute each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ²

Second term: (1/2) * 0 = 0

Third term: (1/4) * ħ²

Adding them: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So <Pz²> is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt( <Pz²> - (<Pz>)^2 ). We found <Pz> is zero, so this becomes sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ / sqrt(2)) ).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Another approach: when the state is a superposition of eigenstates of Pz, the expectation value <Pz> is zero. So the uncertainty would be sqrt( <Pz²> ), because <Pz> is zero.

So yeah, that's correct.

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

But wait, let me think again. Because the state is given as an eigenstate of Px, but the basis is Pz's eigenbasis. So when calculating expectation values, it's correct to use the components as given.

Wait, another way: perhaps the operator Pz is being measured in the basis of Px's eigenstate. But no, the state is given in the Pz basis. So the components are in the Pz basis.

So the way I calculated <Pz> and <Pz²> is correct.

So the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, which is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the three basis states. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are squared to compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (\hbar^2) + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 (0) + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
