Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure. Benzene is the base. Let's number the positions. So, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, looking like this: OEt is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. I should probably draw it out mentally. So, benzene ring with substituents in the 1, 2, 3 positions. Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. Because in a benzene ring, substituents at positions 1,2,3 would actually be adjacent if they're in meta positions. Wait, no—wait. Let me think. Benzene is a six-membered ring. If I have substituents at 1,2,3, that makes them all adjacent. But wait, 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, 3-nitro. So, in the ortho, meta, para setup, but all in adjacent positions. Wait, wait, no. Because in benzene, numbering starts at one point, so the substituents would be in positions 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent but not all adjacent in a way that any two are next to each other. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the synthesis steps.

The question is about which sequence of reactions leads to that compound. The options are A, B, C, D—each has a series of reagents. I need to figure out the correct order of reactions.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me think about the directing effects of each group. Nitro is a meta director. Ethoxy is an activating group, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it's also ortho/para director, but bulky, so maybe more para.

Wait, but the substitution pattern here is that all three are adjacent. So, how do we get them in that arrangement?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again: the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, positions 1, 2, and 3. So, substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, they are in positions where each is adjacent to the others. So, 1 is next to 2 and 3? Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row—like, 1 is connected to 2 and 6, 2 is connected to 1 and 3, etc. So, substituents at 1, 2, 3 would form a meta arrangement for some, but let me think about the synthesis steps.

Typically, when you add substituents to benzene, the order matters because each group directs the next substitution. So, the first substituent will determine where the next one goes.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. So, the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's consider their directing effects:

- Ethoxy is an activating (ortho/para) group.
- tert-butyl is an activating (but bulky, so maybe para is favored).
- Nitro is deactivating (meta) group.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director. So, once it's on the ring, the next substitution would go meta to it. Wait, but in this target, the nitro is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, t-Bu in 2. So, if I have the nitro group, where would the others go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last, since it's a deactivating group and may not be easy to add after activating groups.

Wait. Let's think about the synthesis steps. Each option lists a series of reactions. Let's consider what each reagent does.

First, the starting material is benzene.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation). Then ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration). iii) SO3/H2SO4 (maybe sulfonation). Then iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization). v) dilute H2SO4. vi) H3O+ H2O/heat (hydrolysis). vii) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxylation via SN2? Or perhaps using ethyl bromide with NaOH for substitution). viii) Fe/HCl (maybe another alkylation? Or reduction). ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration).

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me think about each step.

Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts to add t-Bu). ii) nitration. iii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction, but Fe/HCl usually is for dissolving metal reactions, maybe for something else). iv) nitration again. v) diazotization. vi) hydrolysis. vii) NaOH/EtBr—could be Williamson ether synthesis, but with benzene? Wait, no, perhaps it's nucleophilic substitution, but on benzene rings, that's not common. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups. Alternatively, maybe it's introducing an ethoxy group via an SN2 mechanism, but that's not common on benzene. Hmm.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3. ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation). iii) nitration. iv) Fe/HCl. v) diazotization. vi) nitration again. vii) hydrolysis. viii) dilute H2SO4. ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Option D: i) nitration. ii) Fe/HCl. iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3. iv) nitration again. v) diazotization. vi) SO3/H2SO4. vii) dilute H2SO4. viii) hydrolysis. ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, let me think of the correct order. So, benzene is the starting point. The target has three substituents.

I need to figure out the order of adding these groups.

Let me think about the substituents. Nitro is a strong deactivating group. So, once we add nitro, the ring becomes less reactive towards electrophilic substitution, so it's harder to add other groups. So, probably better to add nitro last, after the activating groups.

Alternatively, it depends on whether the substituents are para or meta. Let's think about the positions.

Wait, but the target has all three substituents. Let's consider how they would be added step-wise.

First, let's think about which groups can be added in which order. Since nitro is deactivating, it's better to add after activating groups.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-Bu at 2.

Assuming the first substituent is ethoxy. If I add ethoxy first, then the next substituent would be directed by the ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first substituent is t-Bu. Let me think.

Wait, let me think step by step.

Suppose we add the ethoxy group first. Then, the next substitution would be directed by ethoxy (ortho/para). Then, adding t-Bu could go ortho or para to ethoxy. But then, adding nitro would be influenced by the existing groups.

Alternatively, perhaps adding t-Bu first. Then, the next substituent (say ethoxy) would go ortho or para to t-Bu. Then, adding nitro would be in a position directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, ethoxy in 1, t-Bu in 2. So, if I first add t-Bu at position 2, then ethoxy could be added either at position 1 or 3. Wait, but the ethoxy is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is adding ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But let's think: benzene --> first ethoxy at position 1. Then, when adding t-Bu, the ethoxy directs to ortho and para. So, t-Bu could go at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy) or 4 (para). But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy. Then, adding nitro would need to go at position 3, which is meta to t-Bu and ortho to ethoxy.

Wait, but let's think—when adding the nitro group, the existing substituents are ethoxy (ortho/para) and t-Bu (ortho/para). So, where would the nitro group go?

Wait, ethoxy is activating, t-Bu is activating. So, the ring is activated, so nitration is possible. The directing would be influenced by both substituents. The ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. So, positions adjacent are 3 (next to 2) and 6 (next to 1).

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and also adjacent to ethoxy (position 1 is across from 4; no, wait, position 1 is one end, 2 is next, 3 is next, 4 is across from 1. So, position 3 is next to 2, and across from 6.

Wait, maybe the nitro group would be added at position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1). Hmm, but ethoxy is an activating group, so it would direct incoming electrophiles to positions ortho and para. So, if ethoxy is at 1, the next substituents could be at 2 (ortho), 4 (para) or perhaps 6 (if it's another ortho, but position 6 is adjacent to 1. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring: positions 1, 2, 3,4,5,6. So, 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So, position 2 is next to 1 and 3; position 3 is next to 2 and 4.

So, if ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu in 2, then the ring has substituents in 1 and 2. Now, adding nitro: the existing groups are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is a deactivating group, so it's harder to add, but since the ring is activated, it's possible.

But where would it go? The ethoxy directs to ortho (2 and 6) and para (4). The t-Bu directs to ortho (1 and 3) and para (5).

So, the possible positions are where these directing effects overlap. Position 3 is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and para to ethoxy (position 1's para is position 4, but ethoxy is activating and would direct to 2 and 6 as ortho, and 4 as para). So, position 3 is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. Hmm, but in that case, the ethoxy would direct incoming groups to ortho (2 and 6) and para (4). So, position 3 is meta to ethoxy.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each substituent's directing influence. Since both ethoxy and t-Bu are activating, the nitro group will be directed by the most influential substituent. Maybe the substituent that's more activating or in a position that provides more strong direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last, so in the final step, but the order of adding the substituents before that is important.

Wait, another approach: the target has substituents in positions 1,2,3. So, the nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1 is across from 4, so position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4, but not 1. Wait, actually, position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4, but not directly to 1. So, position 3 is across from position 6. Hmm, perhaps I should visualize this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the order of adding substituents: ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro. Or t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but the nitro is at position 3. Let me think about where each substituent would be placed in each scenario.

Scenario 1: Add ethoxy first.

Benzene → add ethoxy (let's say at position 1). Then, add t-Bu. Ethoxy directs to ortho (2 and 6) and para (4). So t-Bu could go into position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, it's in position 2. So, adding t-Bu as the second substituent would go to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). Then, adding nitro. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). The ethoxy is activating, t-Bu is activating. So, the ring is activated, and the nitro group is an electrophilic substitution.

The existing substituents are ethoxy (directing ortho and para) and t-Bu (directing ortho and para). The available positions for nitro could be:

Looking for positions where they are ortho or para to either group.

After ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2), the remaining positions are 3,4,5,6.

Ethoxy directs to 2,6 (ortho) and 4 (para). t-Bu directs to 1 (ortho),3 (ortho), and 5 (para).

So, the possible positions for nitro are 3 (ortho to t-Bu), 4 (para to ethoxy), 6 (ortho to ethoxy), and 5 (para to t-Bu).

But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So, it's ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1).

So, that's possible. So, in this order, ethoxy → t-Bu → nitro, the nitro would go to position 3.

But wait, the ring is activated, so nitration is possible. But nitro is a deactivating group, so after adding nitro, it's harder to add more groups, but in this case, all three are added.

Wait, but in the target, all three groups are present, so the order must be adding ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

So, the steps would be:

1. Ethoxylation: benzene → ethoxybenzene (para or ortho? Well, for first substitution, it can be at any position, but let's say we control it to be at position 1, perhaps via directing.)

Wait, but in practice, without any other substituents, benzene would undergo ethoxylation at any position, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps the order is more important.

So, the reactions needed for each step.

Ethoxy group: can be introduced via electrophilic substitution, using an ethyl halide with a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3, but wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so perhaps it's introduced via an ether formation. Wait, no, wait: to add an ethoxy group to benzene, typically you would perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's not common. Alternatively, you can use an electrophilic substitution, but ethoxy is not an electrophile. Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's typically for alkyl groups, not ether groups.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, using ethyl chloride in the presence of a strong base, but that's not usually how you add substituents to benzene. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, another approach is to use a meta-directing group to add substituents in a certain order. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after activating the ring, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reagents in the options.

Looking at the options, each step involves various reagents. For example, steps involving AlCl3 are likely Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Steps with HNO3 and H2SO4 are nitrations. Steps with SO3/H2SO4 are sulfonations. NaNO2/HCl is diazotization. H3O+ and heat is hydrolysis (maybe for diazonium salts). NaOH with EtBr is probably a Williamson ether synthesis, but for benzene rings, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but benzene doesn't usually undergo nucleophilic substitution easily. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution on a previously formed diazonium salt. Alternatively, perhaps it's added via a Friedel-Crafts etherification, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order in which the substituents are added in each option.

Looking at option D: First nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), then Fe/HCl. Wait, Fe/HCl is often used in the reduction of nitro groups, but without something else, perhaps it's for dissolving metal reactions. Hmm.

Option A: First t-BuCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation). Then nitration. Then sulfonation. Then diazotization. Then hydrolysis. Then NaOH/EtBr. Then Fe/HCl. Then nitration again.

Wait, that seems like a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if that's the right order.

Option B: t-Bu first, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, then nitration again. That seems like adding two nitro groups, which doesn't match the target.

Option C: t-Bu first, then sulfonation, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, etc.

Hmm. Maybe the correct order starts with t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. So, perhaps the order is ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro. So, looking for an option where the first steps are ethoxylation, then alkylation, then nitration.

Wait, but the options don't directly show that. Let me check each option.

Option A: Step i is t-Bu alkylation. So, first adds t-Bu, then nitration. Then sulfonate. Then diazotization. Then H+/H2O, NaOH/EtBr, Fe/HCl, nitration.

Not sure about that.

Option B: Step i is t-Bu, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, then nitration again. Maybe that's adding two nitro groups, which isn't what we want.

Option C: Step i is t-Bu, then sulfonate, nitration, then Fe/HCl, etc. Hmm.

Option D: Starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl, then t-Bu, then nitration again. Adding two nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the functional groups and their directing effects.

Wait, the target has an ethoxy group, a t-Bu group, and a nitro group. Since nitro is deactivating, it's best added last because after that, the ring is deactivated, making further substitution difficult. So, perhaps the nitro is added last.

So, the order would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-Bu.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy and t-Bu in the correct positions.

Wait, but when adding substituents, each new group is directed by the existing groups.

If ethoxy is first (position 1), then t-Bu is added in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and then nitro in position 3 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy).

So, the order is ethoxy → t-Bu → nitro.

So, looking for the options that have t-Bu added after ethoxy.

But looking at the options, none of them have ethoxylation as the first step. All start with t-Bu alkylation except option D, which starts with nitration.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, after a nitro group is added, which is a meta director, perhaps using a diazonium salt to substitute a nitro group.

Wait, but the target has the nitro group in position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu in position 2. So, maybe the nitro is added after t-Bu and ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after nitration.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's analyze each option to see which sequence could give the desired product.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation: benzene → t-Bu-benzene (say, at position 1).

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration: t-Bu directs ortho and para. Suppose nitro is added at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu).

Wait, t-Bu is an activating group; so nitro will be added ortho or para to t-Bu. So, if t-Bu is at position 1, nitro could be at 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, nitro is at position 3, not 2 or 4. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is at a different position. Let me think: if t-Bu is in position 1, then adding nitro would go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, the nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2). So, perhaps this isn't the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is t-Bu alkylation, then sulfonation (ii in option A is nitration, so no), wait option A's step ii is nitration.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-Bu and nitro, then adding ethoxy.

But that might not lead to the correct positions.

Alternatively, maybe the order is t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

So, let's see.

In option A:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitro added → ortho or para to t-Bu.

iii) sulfonate → adds a SO3 group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Then, iv) diazotization → forms a diazonium salt.

v) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis, perhaps introducing a hydroxyl group.

vi) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps SN2 substitution, but on benzene rings, that's unlikely. Maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups, which might not be present here.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the nitration step.

Wait, the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu in position 2 and ethoxy in position 1. So, perhaps the nitro is added last, directed by both ethoxy and t-Bu.

Wait, another approach: considering the substituents' activating or deactivating nature. Ethoxy and t-Bu are activating, making the ring more reactive. Nitro is deactivating, so it's harder to add after.

So, perhaps the nitro is added first. Wait, but if nitro is added first, the next groups would be directed by it, which is meta. Let me think.

Benzene → add nitro (position 1). Then, ethoxy would go meta to nitro (position 4), but in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, which is the same as nitro. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if nitro is added first, then the next substituent would be in meta to nitro. So, ethoxy would go to position 4, but that's not the target. So, that's probably not the case.

So, probably the nitro is added last.

So, the order is ethoxy, t-Bu, then nitro.

But looking at the options, none of them have ethoxylation as the first step. All start with t-Bu alkylation except option D, which starts with nitration.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me think about what each reagent does in the steps.

Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds an alkyl group (t-Bu in this case).

Nitration: adds nitro group.

Sulfonation: adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H).

Fe/HCl: used in various reactions, like Ullmann coupling, but more commonly, it's used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, or in the production of diazonium salts (with NaNO2).

NaNO2/HCl: diazotization step, typically converting an amine to a diazonium chloride.

H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salts to produce phenols (if H2O is used) or other groups.

NaOH and EtBr: possibly a Williamson ether synthesis, but in the context of aromatic rings, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, which is less common. Alternatively, it could be introducing an ethoxy group via an SN2 mechanism, but that's not typical for benzene rings.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For instance, if a leaving group is present on the benzene ring, like a nitro group, perhaps it can be replaced by an ethoxy group. But nitro groups are not good leaving groups. However, using a diazonium salt, which can be hydrolyzed to a phenol, which can then undergo nucleophilic substitution with a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a diazonium salt, which is then substituted with an ethoxy group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's typically for alkyl groups, not ethers. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds acyl groups, but not ethers.

Hmm. Okay, maybe I should try to think of each option's steps and see which one could lead to the desired product.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene. Let's say nitro is added in position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reducing nitro to amine? But then what?

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adds t-Bu group. Where would it go? The ring now has a nitro group, which is deactivating and meta-directing. So, the t-Bu would add meta to nitro, which would be position 4.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Now, the ring has nitro in 1 and t-Bu in 4. Nitration would be directed by the most influential group. Nitro is deactivating, so it's meta-directing. So, the next nitro would go to position 2 (meta to nitro) or position 6 (meta to nitro). Alternatively, the t-Bu is activating, so perhaps the nitration is directed by it to ortho or para.

Wait, but the ring now has two substituents: nitro (1) and t-Bu (4). Nitro is deactivating, t-Bu is activating. The activating groups (t-Bu) would direct the incoming electrophile to their ortho and para positions. So, para to t-Bu (position 4) is position 1 (already nitro) and position 8, which doesn't exist, so perhaps ortho to t-Bu, which is position 3 and 5.

So, the nitration could go to position 3 or 5. In the target, the nitro is at position 3, but in this option, step iv would be adding a second nitro group. That doesn't match the target, which only has one nitro group. So, option D is likely incorrect.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → benzene → t-Bu-benzene. Let's assume t-Bu is in position 1.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. t-Bu is activating, directs to ortho (2 and 6) and para (4). Suppose nitro is added at position 2 (ortho to t-Bu).

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine? But then what?

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. The ring now has t-Bu (1) and nitro (2). Nitro is deactivating, so it's a meta director. So, the next nitro would go to position 5 (meta to nitro at 2). But in the target, there's no second nitro group. So, this option seems to add two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Hmm, so option B is probably wrong.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta). The nitration would be directed by the more influential group, which is the sulfonic acid. So, nitro would go meta to sulfonic acid. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this option is probably incorrect.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. t-Bu is activating, so nitro is added at ortho (2) or para (4). Let's say it's added at 2.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Adds sulfonic acid group. Where? The ring now has t-Bu (1) and nitro (2). Sulfonation would be directed by these groups. Nitro is deactivating, meta-directing; t-Bu is activating, ortho/para. So, the sulfonic acid could go meta to nitro, which would be position 6. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So, this option adds a sulfonic acid, which is not part of the target. So, option A is incorrect.

Hmm, none of the options look correct so far. Did I make a mistake in evaluating?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of adding the ethoxy group via a substitution reaction after forming a diazonium salt. For example, after a nitro group is in place, perhaps a diazonium salt is formed, which is then substituted with an ethoxy group.

Wait, but the target doesn't have an amino group, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activating group. Since the ring has t-Bu and nitro, perhaps that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis, which typically involves an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide. But in the context of benzene, perhaps it's a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group could be added via an elimination reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a phenol group and then substituting it with an ethoxy group.

For example, using a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis gives a phenol. Then, the phenol could be treated with a base and an ethylating agent to form the ethoxy group.

Looking at option A, step vi is H3O+ and heat, which could be the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to form a phenol. Then, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which would be an ethylation of the phenol to form the ethoxy group.

So, if the steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) nitration → add nitro.

iii) sulfonation → add sulfonic acid (but target doesn't have this, so maybe this is a wrong path).

iv) diazotization → convert a group to diazonium.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis (maybe to form a phenol).

vi) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a ketone? Not sure.)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to go through each option's steps.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu group.

iv) nitration again → add another nitro.

But the target has only one nitro group, so this can't be right.

Wait, what if the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and t-Bu groups?

Looking again, perhaps the correct option is A, but let's think:

Option A steps:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitro added (ortho to t-Bu, say position 2).

iii) sulfonate added (position 4, perhaps).

iv) diazotization: maybe the nitro group is converted to a diazonium salt.

v) dilute H2SO4: hydrolysis to form a phenol.

vi) H3O+ and heat: perhaps another hydrolysis step, like converting a nitro to something else.

vii) NaOH and EtBr: perhaps ethylation of a phenol to form ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl: maybe reduction.

ix) nitration again.

Hmm, but this seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it leads to the desired product.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is adding t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any that directly do that. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after nitration.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

Benzene → add t-Bu → add ethoxy → add nitro.

But in the options, I don't see this exact sequence. Let me check each option again.

Option B: steps are t-Bu, nitro, Fe/HCl, nitro again. Doesn't fit.

Option C: t-Bu, sulfonate, nitro, Fe/HCl, etc. No.

Option A: t-Bu, nitro, sulfonate, then diazo, hydrolysis, ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr, Fe/HCl, nitro again. But that might lead to multiple nitro groups.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about each step's purpose.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group. For example, if we have a nitro group, it can be converted to a diazonium salt, which can then be hydrolyzed to a phenol, and then the phenol can be alkylated to form an ethoxy group.

So, the steps would involve:

1. Nitration → add nitro.

2. Diazotization → form diazonium.

3. Hydrolysis → form phenol.

4. Alkylation → form ethoxy.

But then, where would the t-Bu group fit in?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add nitro.

3. Convert nitro to diazonium.

4. Hydrolyze to phenol.

5. Alkylate to ethoxy.

So, let me see if any option follows this order.

Looking at option A:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitro added.

iii) sulfonate added (so not relevant).

iv) diazo → perhaps on nitro.

v) H+/H2O → hydrolysis to phenol.

vi) H3O+ and heat → maybe another hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxylation.

But this would require that the nitro group is converted to a phenol, then ethoxy is added. But in the target, the nitro is present, so this doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added last, after ethoxy and t-Bu. So, the ring has ethoxy and t-Bu, then nitro is added. But how to arrange that.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis starts with benzene, adds ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But none of the options start with ethoxylation. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is added in the last step via substitution.

Wait, looking at option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. This could be a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps substituting a leaving group with ethoxy. But in the ring, which group would be the leaving group?

If the ring has a nitro group, which is a meta director, perhaps after some steps, it's replaced with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps a nitro group is reduced to an amine, which is then alkylated to form an ethoxy group.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to outline each step for each option and see which one would give the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B. Let me think.

Option B steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro added (ortho to t-Bu, say position 2).

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro again. Now, the ring has t-Bu (1), amine (2), and nitro (say position 4 or 6).

But the target doesn't have two nitro groups, so this seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is something else. Fe/HCl could be for reducing the nitro group to an amine, but then step iv is another nitration, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct sequence of substituents and which option follows that.

The target has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

So, the synthesis must arrange for these substituents in that order.

Assuming the order is ethoxy → t-Bu → nitro.

So, the steps would be:

1. Benzene → ethoxybenzene (using an electrophilic substitution, but how? Maybe via a different method, like using a directing group.)

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be strongly activated. So, maybe after adding a nitro group, which is a meta director, and then adding ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's typically for alkyl halides, not ethers. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution on a bromine atom.

Wait, perhaps if a bromide is attached to the ring, it can be substituted by an ethoxide ion. But how to get bromide on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group, but that's not feasible.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider the options again, focusing on the presence of SO3 and other groups.

Wait, looking at the target, it doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So any option that includes a sulfonation step (like options A, C) would introduce an extra group, making the target unattainable. So, options A and C are probably incorrect.

That leaves options B and D. Let's re-examine them.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro again.

But this adds two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added.

iv) Nitration again → another nitro.

But the target has only one nitro, so this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add nitro first.

2. Then add ethoxy.

3. Then add t-Bu.

But when you add nitro first, the next substitution would be meta to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, but how would that work.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is adding t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu in 2 and ethoxy in 1. So, when adding nitro last, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Then, the nitro would be added ortho to t-Bu (position 3) and ortho to ethoxy (position 6), but in the target, it's at position 3.

So, the nitro would go to position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1). So, that's possible.

So, the order is t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But in the options, I'm looking for steps that:

i) Add t-Bu.

ii) Add ethoxy.

iii) Add nitro.

Looking at the options, option B's steps are:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl.

iv) nitro.

Which doesn't fit.

Option D's steps are:

i) nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl.

iii) t-Bu.

iv) nitro.

Which adds two nitro groups, which is wrong.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the nitro is added. Let me think.

If the nitro is added first, then the ethoxy group is added via substitution on the nitro group. But I'm not sure how that works.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Add ethoxy (directed by t-Bu).

3. Add nitro (directed by both t-Bu and ethoxy).

So, let's model this.

Benzene → add t-Bu (position 1) via Friedel-Crafts.

Then, add ethoxy. The t-Bu is an activating group, directing ortho and para. So, ethoxy could be added at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). In the target, it's added at position 1, which is where t-Bu is. So, that doesn't fit. Wait, no, the ethoxy is at position 1 in the target, but t-Bu is at position 2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added to position 1, then t-Bu to position 2, then nitro to position 3.

But in the options, the first step is t-Bu alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Option B steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro added. Let's say position 2 (ortho to t-Bu).

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitro group. Not desired.

So, this adds two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration → nitro added to position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added. Nitro is a meta director, so t-Bu would go to position 4 (meta to nitro). But in target, t-Bu is at position 2.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add t-Bu.

But I don't see any option that starts with ethoxylation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, using a diazonium salt. So:

Benzene → add nitro → then form diazonium salt → substitute with ethoxy.

But in that case, the nitro would be in position 1, and the ethoxy would be in position 4 (meta to nitro). But the target has ethoxy in position 1, which is not meta. So, that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for the option that has the nitro group added last.

Looking at option A:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitro added.

iii) sulfonate added.

iv) diazo.

v) H+/H2O.

vi) H3O+ and heat.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps ethoxy added.

So, the final steps would have t-Bu, nitro, then ethoxy.

But the target has ethoxy in position 1, which is adjacent to t-Bu in 2. So maybe after adding nitro, the steps convert something to ethoxy.

Wait, step vii in option A is NaOH and EtBr. That might be a nucleophilic substitution, where a leaving group is replaced with ethoxy. But in the ring, which group would leave? Maybe a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group under certain conditions.

So, after step iii, the ring has t-Bu (1), nitro (2), and sulfonate (4). Then, step iv is diazo, which would target the sulfonate group? No, diazonium is typically formed from amine groups.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the target has an ethoxy group, which is an activating group. So, it should be added after activating groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

But I'm not sure which option aligns with this.

Wait, looking at option B again:

i) t-Bu added.

ii) nitro added → ortho or para to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitro again → but that's not desired.

So, option B seems incorrect.

Hmm. I'm really not sure, but based on the analysis, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **Ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing (bulkier, making para substitution more favorable).
   - **Nitro**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Synthesis Strategy**:
   - The nitro group is deactivating and should ideally be added last to avoid deactivating the ring prematurely.
   - The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating and should be added earlier to facilitate subsequent substitutions.

3. **Critical Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**:
     - Steps: Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, ethoxylation, Fe/HCl, nitration.
     - Concerns: Introduces a sulfonic acid group (not part of the target) and appears to add a second nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target structure.
   - **Option B**:
     - Steps: Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), nitration, Fe/HCl, nitration.
     - Concerns: Adds two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target structure.
   - **Option C**:
     - Steps: Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl, diazotization, nitration.
     - Concerns: Introduces a sulfonic acid group (not part of the target) and does not align with the desired substitution pattern.
   - **Option D**:
     - Steps: Nitration, Fe/HCl, Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu), nitration.
     - Concerns: Adds two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none perfectly align with the desired substitution pattern. However, **Option A** comes closest, as it includes the Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-Bu addition), nitration, and ethoxylation steps, which could potentially lead to the target structure. Despite the introduction of a sulfonic acid group, it is the most plausible option among those provided.
