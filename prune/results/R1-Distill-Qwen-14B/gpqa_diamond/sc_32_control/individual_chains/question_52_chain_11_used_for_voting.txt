Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars with spots affecting the effective temperature and how that impacts the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Because spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature must decrease.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They say that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. And we need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and T is the temperature.

In this case, the ratio is n1/n2, where level 1 and level 2 are the two energy levels. The transition between them is at 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range, I think. So the energy difference between the levels can be calculated from the wavelength. Since energy E is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c the speed of light.

But wait, the problem says LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium) holds, so each region is in thermal equilibrium. Ah, but when there are spots, different parts of the photosphere are at different temperatures. Hmm, but the overall Teff is given as 5500 K. Does that affect the calculation? Or are we considering the average temperature in some way?

Wait, no. The problem states that when the surface is partially covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases. So the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. But for the ratio, each region's temperature would matter, but the spots are cooler, and the rest are at higher temperature.

Wait, but if the spots are 40% of the surface, then 60% is at 6000 K and 40% is at a lower temperature. But wait, what is the temperature of the spots? The problem doesn't directly give us that, but perhaps we can model it.

Wait, the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K when spots cover 40% of the surface. So perhaps the effective temperature is a sort of average. The effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity. Luminosity, L, is proportional to the integral over the surface of the flux from each element. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says flux F = σ T^4.

When there are spots, part of the surface is at a lower temperature. Let me model this. Let the fraction of the surface covered by spots be f (0.4), and the rest (1-f) is at the normal temperature T1 (6000 K). The spotted regions are at T2 (which I need to find). The total luminosity L is then L = 4πR² [ (1-f) σ T1^4 + f σ T2^4 ].

The effective temperature, T_eff, is such that L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. So,

(1-f) T1^4 + f T2^4 = T_eff^4.

We can plug in the values. f = 0.4, T1=6000 K, T_eff=5500 K.

So,

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T2)^4 = (5500)^4.

Let me compute each term. 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12. So 0.6 * 1296e12 = 777.6e12.

5500^4: 55^4 *1e4. 55^4 is (55^2)^2 = (3025)^2 ≈ 9,150,625. So 9.150625e6 * 1e4 = 9.150625e10. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 5.5e3 K is 5500 K, which is 5.5e3. So (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14. Hmm, wait, wait. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 5.5^4 is (5.5^2)^2. 5.5^2=30.25. 30.25 squared is 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 (because (1e3)^4 is 1e12) So 9.150625e14.

Wait, no. Wait, 5500 K is 5.5e3 K. So (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 915.0625 *1e12 = 9.150625e14.

So,

0.6*(6000)^4 = 0.6 * (6e3)^4 = 0.6 * 1296e12 = 777.6e12 = 7.776e14.

0.4*(T2)^4 = T_eff^4 - 0.6*(6000^4) = 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

So,

0.4*(T2^4) = 1.374625e14

T2^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root to find T2.

So,

T2 = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. Let's take logs.

ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14) ≈ 1.235 + 32.236 ≈ 33.471.

Divide by 4: 8.36775.

Exponential: e^8.36775 ≈ e^8 is about 2980, e^0.36775≈1.444. 2980 *1.444 ≈ 4295 K.

Wait, but that's approximate. Alternatively, perhaps using calculator-like steps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute T2^4 = 3.4365625e14.

We can write this as 3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 * 1e14 = 3.4365625 * (1e3^4) ) because 1e3^4 is 1e12, but wait 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, let's compute T2 = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = 1e3.5 = 3.162e3 ≈ 3162 K.

Wait, but 3.4365625e14 is 3.4365625 times 1e14. So the fourth root is (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4)= approx (3.4365625)^(0.25) ) * 3162 K.

3.4365625 is about 3.4366. Let's approximate the fourth root of 3.4366.

We know that 1.3^4 is (1.3^2)^2 = (1.69)^2 ≈ 2.856. 1.4^4 is (1.96)^2=3.8416. So 3.436 is between 1.3^4 and 1.4^4. Let's find x where x^4 ≈3.4366.

Let me compute 1.35^4: 1.35^2=1.8225; squared is 3.3207. 1.36^4: 1.36^2=1.8496; squared is ~3.420. Close to 3.4366.

So, 1.36^4 ≈ 3.420, and 1.365^4: let's compute 1.365^2= (1.36 +0.005)^2 ≈ 1.8609 + 0.0136= ~1.8745. Then square that for 1.365^4: 1.8745^2 ≈ 3.513. Hmm, but 3.513 is higher than 3.4366.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 1.36^4= (1.36^2)^2= (1.8496)^2. Compute 1.8496 * 1.8496.

1.8496 *1.8496:

Let's compute:

1.8 *1.8 =3.24
1.8 *0.0496=0.08928
0.0496 *1.8=0.08928
0.0496 *0.0496≈0.00246

So,

1.8496^2 = 3.24 + 0.08928 + 0.08928 + 0.00246 ≈ 3.4209 + 0.00246 ≈ 3.4234.

So 1.36^4 is approximately 3.4234.

But we have 3.4366, which is 3.4366-3.4234=0.0132 higher.

The derivative of x^4 is 4x^3. So for x=1.36, dx ≈ (0.0132)/(4*(1.36)^3).

(1.36)^3= 1.36 *1.8496≈2.515.

So dx≈ 0.0132/(4 *2.515) ≈ 0.0132/10.06 ≈ 0.00131.

So x≈1.36 +0.00131≈1.3613.

So the fourth root of 3.4366 is approximately 1.3613.

So T2 = 1.3613 * 3162 K ≈ 1.3613 *3.162e3 ≈ let's compute 3.162e3 *1.3613.

3.162e3 is 3162.

3162 * 1.3613 = let's compute 3162 *1.3 = 4110.6; 3162 *0.0613≈ 3162 *0.06=189.72 and 3162 *0.0013≈4.11; total≈189.72+4.11=193.83. So total is approx 4110.6 +193.83≈4304.4 K.

So T2≈4304 K.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check the calculations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, the equation is (1-f) T1^4 + f T2^4 = Teff^4.

We have f=0.4, T1=6000, Teff=5500.

So:

0.6*(6000)^4 +0.4*T2^4 =5500^4.

Compute 6000^4: 6^4 is 1296, and 1000^4 is 1e12, so 6000^4=1296e12.

Similarly, 5500^4= (5.5e3)^4= (5.5)^4 *1e12= 915.0625e12.

So,

0.6 * 1296e12 = 777.6e12.

0.4 * T2^4 = 915.0625e12 -777.6e12 = 137.4625e12.

So T2^4 = (137.4625e12) / 0.4 = 343.65625e12.

So T2^4= 3.4365625e14.

Wait, no, 343.65625e12 is 3.4365625e14, yes.

Wait, 343.65625e12 is 3.4365625e14? Wait, 343.65625e12 is 343.65625 *1e12 = 3.4365625e14. Yes.

So taking the fourth root: (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Which we can compute as (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4).

The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = (1e14)^(0.25) = 1e(14*0.25) =1e3.5= approx 3162.27766 K.

Now, (3.4365625)^(1/4). Let's compute that.

We can take logarithms. ln(3.4365625) ≈ 1.234. So 1.234 /4 = 0.3085.

e^0.3085 ≈ 1.36.

So, T2≈1.36 *3162.27766 ≈ 4304 K (as before).

So the spots are at about 4304 K.

Now, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let's denote the ratio as R = (n1)/(n2).

In LTE, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms, or 144.8 nm, which is ultraviolet. The energy difference between the levels is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.
c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.
λ = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ approx 1.372e-18 J.

But since we're dealing with energy differences, perhaps we can express E in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9950 K.

So E/(k) is about 9950 K. So the energy difference is about 9950 K in terms of k.

Wait, but that's the energy in units of k. So the exponent in the Boltzmann factor becomes (E2-E1)/(k T) = (E/k)/T ≈ 9950 K / T.

So, the ratio R = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - 9950 / T )

Wait, but the ratio is decreasing when the star has spots. Let's think: when the spots are present, the overall photosphere has a lower effective temperature. But wait, when spots are present, the photosphere isn't uniformly at 5500 K, because some parts are 6000 K and others 4304 K. Hmm, but I think the problem is considering the average effect. Or perhaps each region contributes to the line formation, but the problem says "the stellar photosphere is in LTE". So perhaps the Ti atoms in each region are in their own local thermal equilibrium, and the ratio would vary depending on the temperature.

Wait, but the observed ratio is that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher. So spotless R_spotless = (n1/n2)_spotless, and R_spotted = (n1/n2)_spotted. The factor is R_spotless / R_spotted.

But how does the presence of spots affect the overall observed ratio? Because some regions are cooler (spots) and others are hotter (unspotted). So perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem asks for the factor by which this ratio changes. So we need to compute the ratio in the two cases: when the star is spotless (T=6000 K) and when it has spots.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But how does that affect the average ratio of Ti in each region? The photosphere isn't at a uniform temperature. So the total ratio would be a combination of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K, and hence the ratio is calculated at that temperature. But that might not be accurate because the spots are cooler and the rest are hotter. So each region contributes differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be the case, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's considered that the effective temperature is 5500 K, and thus the average temperature is 5500 K. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach, but maybe we can proceed with that assumption.

Wait, another approach: the problem says that the spotted star has an overall Teff of 5500 K. So perhaps the ratio when the star has spots is calculated at 5500 K, and when it's spotless, it's at 6000 K.

So, the ratio R = (g1/g2) * exp( - 9950 / T )

So, for T_spotless = 6000 K, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -9950 /6000 )

When T_spotted =5500 K, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -9950 /5500 )

The factor is R1 / R2 = [ exp( -9950/6000 ) ] / [ exp( -9950/5500 ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ -9950/6000 + 9950/5500 ] )

Wait, no, because R1 is at 6000 K, and R2 is at 5500 K. So R1/R2 would be [exp( -9950/6000 ) ] / [ exp( -9950/5500 ) ]

Which is exp( ( -9950/6000 + 9950/5500 ) )

= exp( 9950 (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.6667e-4.

So, 1/5500 -1/6000 ≈ (1.818 -1.6667)*1e-4 = 0.1513e-4 =1.513e-5.

Then, 9950 * 1.513e-5 ≈ 9950 * 1.513e-5.

Let me compute that: 9950 * 1.513e-5 = 0.1507.

So, exp(0.1507) ≈ 1.162. So the factor R1/R2 ≈ 1.162. But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_spotted = R2 is lower than R1, so R1/R2 would be greater than 1. So which option is that?

Looking at the options, option A is ~1.1. Hmm, but wait, 1.16 is close to 1.1 but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 9950 is approximately 1e4. So 1e4 * (1.5e-5) =0.15.

So exp(0.15)≈1.1618, which is about 1.16. So the factor is approximately 1.16, which is about 1.16, so the closest option is A) ~1.1, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 9950 more accurately. Let me recalculate E = hc/lambda.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s
c=2.99792458e8 m/s
lambda=1448e-10 m.

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8) / (1448e-10)

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 *3e8 ≈ 1.987821e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.987821e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

So E/k = 1.372e-18 J / 1.380649e-23 J/K ≈ 9945 K.

So E/(k) is approximately 9945 K.

Now, the factor:

(9945) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] 

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000≈0.000166667.

Difference is 0.000015151.

Multiply by 9945: 9945 * 0.000015151 ≈ let's compute:

9945 * 0.00001 =0.09945

9945 * 0.000005151 = approx 9945 *5.151e-6 ≈ 0.05119.

So total is approximately 0.09945 + 0.05119=0.15064.

So the exponent is 0.15064.

So exp(0.15064) ≈ e^0.15064.

e^0.1=1.10517, e^0.15≈1.1618, e^0.15064≈ approximately 1.162.

So the factor is about 1.162. So R1/R2≈1.162.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1.1, option B is ~7.8, etc. So 1.16 is closer to option A (~1.1), but the options don't have 1.16. Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the spots are present, the ratio is lower than when there are no spots. So R_spotless is higher, R_spotted is lower. So the factor is R_spotless / R_spotted = 1.162.

But the options don't include 1.16. The closest option is A) ~1.1. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: the spots cause the average temperature to decrease, but the line formation is more influenced by the hotter regions. Or perhaps the ratio is a weighted average of the ratios from the two regions.

Wait, perhaps the real effect is that the presence of cooler spots means that some of the Ti is in the cooler regions, where the ratio is lower. So the overall observed ratio is a combination of the ratios from the hotter (unspotted) and cooler (spotted) regions.

So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average between the two regions. Because the spots are 40% of the surface, but their contribution to the flux is 0.4 * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) * (something?), but perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach should take into account that only 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 40% is at 4304 K. So the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions, weighted by their contribution to the observed line.

Wait, but how? Because the line is formed in each region, and the equivalent width or the line strength would be a sum of contributions from each region.

But the problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower, as per the observation.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is dominated by the hotter regions when the star is spotless, because higher temperature favors higher excitation, leading to lower ratio (n1/n2) if E2 > E1. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation says n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then higher T makes n2/n1 larger. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So exp(-x) decreases when x increases. So n1/n2 decreases with increasing T.

Wait, let me plug in some numbers.

Suppose E2-E1 = 10,000 K.

At T=6000 K, (10,000)/(6000) ≈ 1.6667. So exp(-1.6667)≈0.1889.

At T=5500 K, (10,000)/(5500)≈1.8182. exp(-1.8182)≈0.1623.

So the ratio n1/n2 is lower at higher T. So when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, so when the star is spotless (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is higher than when T=5500 K (spots present). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Which matches with our calculation: when T goes down, n1/n2 increases, but when T increases, it decreases.

Wait no, wait, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, when the star is spotless, T=6000 K, so n1/n2 is lower than when T=5500 K, because for T=6000, the exponent is 10000/6000=1.6667, exp(-1.6667)=0.1889. At T=5500, exponent is 10000/5500≈1.818, exp(-1.818)=0.1623. So n1/n2 is lower at higher T.

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. But according to the calculations, R (n1/n2) is lower at higher T. So when T is 6000, R is ~0.1889, when T is 5500, R is ~0.1623. So when the star has spots, R is lower, which matches the problem statement.

Wait, but no, wait. Let me clarify: when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, 5500 K. So T_eff is lower, but the ratio R = (n1/n2) would be higher or lower?

Wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)) decreases. So n1/n2 decreases.

So for higher T, lower R. For lower T, higher R.

So when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K), so R would be higher. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, this can't be. So perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Let's think again. The ratio observed is (n1/n2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T leads to lower (n1/n2). So if the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, so higher (n1/n2). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, i.e., (n1/n2) is lower. That would imply that the effective temperature is higher when the star has spots, which contradicts the given that Teff is 5500 K.

Hmm, this suggests I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the levels. Let me re-express the ratio.

The ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent becomes more negative, making exp(-x) smaller. So (n1/n2) decreases with increasing T.

So when T is higher, (n1/n2) is lower.

So when the star is spotless, T=6000 K, (n1/n2) is lower. When the star has spots, T_eff=5500 K, (n1/n2) is higher.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this suggests that the observed ratio is lower when the star has spots. But according to the equation, if T is lower, (n1/n2) should be higher. So this is a contradiction.

Hence, I must have made a mistake in applying the equation. Maybe I should think in terms of the ionization balance. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1) instead of (n1/n2). Let me double-check the question.

The question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. So it's (n1/n2), where level 1 and level 2 are both neutral Ti. So the ionization state isn't changing, only the excitation between two energy levels.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the ratio (n2/n1), which would be the opposite. Let's see.

If the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

In that case, higher T would lead to higher (n2/n1), so (n2/n1) increases with T. So when the star is spotless (higher T), (n2/n1) is higher, leading to (n1/n2) being lower.

But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So if (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1), then (n1/n2) would be lower when (n2/n1) is higher.

So, the problem states that when the star has spots, (n1/n2) decreases, which would happen if (n2/n1) increases. So higher T would cause (n2/n1) to increase, leading to lower (n1/n2). So spotless T=6000 K: (n2/n1) is higher, (n1/n2) is lower. When star has spots, T=5500 K: (n2/n1) is lower, so (n1/n2) is higher.

But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that (n1/n2) is lower when the star has spots. Which would require that (n2/n1) is higher when the star has spots.

Wait, that would only happen if the star with spots has a higher T, which contradicts the given Teff. So this suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), and the problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when spots are present, (n2/n1) is lower. So this would imply that when T is lower, (n2/n1) is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n2/n1) increases with T. So this would not make sense.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. So when spots are present, (n1/n2) is lower.

Wait, earlier I thought that higher T leads to lower (n1/n2). So if the star has spots, T_eff is lower, so (n1/n2) would be higher. But the problem states it's lower. So that suggests that my earlier assumption about the effect of T on the ratio is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps the energy difference E2-E1 is negative, meaning E1>E2. So (E2-E1) is negative, so when you plug into the Boltzmann equation, the exponent becomes positive.

Wait, if E2 < E1, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative, so the exp term becomes exp( positive number ), so (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( positive ), which increases with T.

But if E2 < E1, then the transition would correspond to a photon of longer wavelength (since E=hc/lambda, lower E means longer lambda). The given transition is 1448 Å, which is about 144 nm, which is UV. So E is higher than for visible light, implying E2>E1.

So E2 must be higher than E1. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive.

So, back to the problem. The ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is lower than when it doesn't.

But according to the equation, (n1/n2) is lower when T is higher, because exp(-x) decreases as x increases (since x is positive).

So for (n1/n2) to be lower when the star has spots, the T must be higher when the star has spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K). So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The problem says that when the surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So when there are spots, T_eff is lower.

But the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), (n1/n2) is lower.

But according to the equation, when T is lower, (n1/n2) is higher, which contradicts the observation.

So this suggests that perhaps the energy difference is such that E2 < E1. But that would mean that the transition emits a photon, which would correspond to a lower energy (longer wavelength). But the transition is given as 1448 Å, which is UV, implying higher energy, so E2>E1.

So I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of spots affects the average temperature, but each region (spot and non-spot) contributes to the observed ratio. So the observed ratio is a combination of the ratios from the two regions.

So, when 40% of the surface is at T_spot and 60% is at T_unspot.

The observed (n1/n2) would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions.

So, the flux from each region is sigma * T^4.

Wait, the line flux would depend on the number of atoms in each level, but perhaps it's more straightforward to consider the equivalent width or the ratio as a simple average, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the observed ratio is the average over the surface of (n1/n2) in each region, weighted by their contribution to the line.

But I'm not exactly sure how to model that. Let me think of it as the ratio being the average of the two ratios, weighted by the areas.

So,

R_avg = (f * R_spot + (1-f) * R_unspot) / (f + (1-f)) )

But R_unspot is at 6000 K, R_spot at T_spot=4304 K.

So,

R_avg = 0.4 * R_spot + 0.6 * R_unspot.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would mean R_avg < R_unspot.

Wait, but R_spot is the ratio when T is lower. According to Boltzmann, R = (n1/n2) is higher when T is lower. So R_spot > R_unspot. So R_avg would be higher than R_unspot only if R_spot is higher, but 0.4 R_spot + 0.6 R_unspot. Since R_spot > R_unspot, R_avg would be higher than R_unspot.

But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, implying R_avg < R_unspot. So this can't be, unless the assumption is that R_avg is dominated by the hotter regions.

Wait, perhaps the line formation is dominated by the hotter regions because they emit more flux. So perhaps the observed ratio is closer to the unspotted region's ratio.

But this is getting too vague, and perhaps I should proceed with the earlier approach, assuming that the ratio is calculated at the effective temperature.

Wait, but that led to a factor of ~1.16, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the presence of spots leads to a lower T, which would increase (n1/n2), but the ratio is observed to decrease. Thus, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which would invert the trend.

Wait, if the ratio is (n2/n1), then higher T would lead to higher ratio. So when the star has spots (lower T), (n2/n1) is lower, so (n1/n2) is higher.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that would not fit.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star's spectrum is dominated by the unspotted regions, which are hotter, so the observed ratio is approximately that of the unspotted regions. So when the star has spots, the ratio is similar to when T=6000 K, but the problem states that the ratio decreases. So perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio at 6000 K and 5500 K, and find the factor.

But earlier calculation gave a factor of ~1.16, which isn't among the options. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E/(k). Let me recalculate E/(k) accurately.

E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s
lambda = 1448e-10 m.

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8) / (1448e-10)

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = approximately 1.9864e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9864e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9864e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.371e-18 J.

E/k = 1.371e-18 J / 1.380649e-23 J/K ≈ 9939 K.

So 9939 K.

Now, the exponent is 9939 / T.

So for T_spotless =6000 K, exponent is 9939/6000 ≈1.6565.

So exp(-1.6565) ≈ e^-1.6565 ≈ 0.1914.

At T_spotted=5500 K, exponent is 9939/5500 ≈1.8071.

exp(-1.8071)=approx 0.1643.

So R1 = (g1/g2) * 0.1914.

R2 = (g1/g2) * 0.1643.

The factor is R1/R2 = 0.1914 / 0.1643 ≈1.165.

So approximately 1.165, which is about 1.16. The closest option is A) ~1.1, but this seems a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, and the transition is calculated at that temperature. Then, the factor would be (5500/6000)^(some power), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the inverse: the ratio is (n2/n1), which would invert the factor.

If the ratio is (n2/n1), then R1 = (g2/g1) exp(9939/6000) ≈ (g2/g1) * exp(1.6565) ≈ (g2/g1) *5.25.

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(1.8071) ≈ (g2/g1)*6.09.

So the factor R1/R2 = 5.25 /6.09 ≈0.861. So the factor would be ~0.86, which is less than 1. But the question says the ratio decreases, so if the ratio is (n2/n1), then R1/R2=0.86 would mean that when the star is spotless, (n2/n1) is lower, which does not fit the problem statement.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the factor is greater than 1, because R_spotless is higher than R_spotted.

Earlier calculation gives 1.16, which is approximately 1.1. So option A is ~1.1. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another angle: when the star has spots, the photosphere isn't at 5500 K everywhere. Some parts are at 6000 K, others at 4304 K. The observed ratio would be a weighted average. So perhaps the ratio is lower than spotless because the cooler regions contribute more to the ratio.

But how?

The observed ratio is a combination of the two regions. So R_avg = (f * R_spot + (1-f) * R_unspot).

R_unspot is at 6000 K: R_unspot = (g1/g2) exp(-9939/6000) ≈ 0.1914.

R_spot is at 4304 K. Let me compute R_spot.

E/(k T) = 9939 /4304 ≈2.309.

So exp(-2.309) ≈0.1.

So R_spot = (g1/g2)*0.1.

So R_avg = 0.4 *0.1 + 0.6 *0.1914 = 0.04 + 0.11484 =0.15484.

R_spotless = 0.1914.

The factor is R_spotless / R_avg = 0.1914 / 0.15484 ≈1.236.

So approximately 1.24, which is close to option A) ~1.1, but still not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio using the average temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the ratio due to the change in the effective temperature, but that seems inconsistent with the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, another approach: what if the temperature change affects the excitation of the lines, leading to a change in the ratio.

Wait, the problem says that the transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-UV. The star's Teff being 6000 K would have a certain continuum level, while 5500 K would have a lower continuum. But I'm not sure how that affects the line ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the ionization state, but the question specifies that it's about neutral Ti, so ionization isn't the issue.

I think I've gone as far as I can. Based on the earlier calculation, the factor is approximately 1.16, which is closest to option A) ~1.1. But the options don't have 1.16, so perhaps the intended answer is B) ~7.8, which is exp(2.1) ≈8. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the effective temperature. Let me think differently: when the star has spots, the overall luminosity is lower, but the ratio depends on the temperature where the spectral line is formed. If the line is formed deeper in the photosphere when spots are present, perhaps the effective temperature there is higher. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple ratio based on the temperatures. Let me think of the ratio as inversely proportional to the temperature. So factor = T_spotless / T_spotted = 6000 /5500 ≈1.09. Which is ~1.1, matching option A.

But that's a very rough approximation, and the correct approach should involve the Boltzmann factor. So perhaps the intended answer is 1.1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, so the energy difference is calculated as:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Expressing \(E\) in units of \(kT\), we find:

\[
\frac{E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9950 \, \text{K}.
\]

The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature \(T\). For the star without spots (\(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\)) and with spots (\(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\)), the factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spotless}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spotted}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{9950}{6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{9950}{5500}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{9950}{5500} - \frac{9950}{6000}\right).
\]

Simplifying the exponent:

\[
\frac{9950}{5500} - \frac{9950}{6000} = 9950 \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) \approx 9950 \times 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \approx 0.1506.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(0.1506) \approx 1.162.
\]

This factor indicates that the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two levels is approximately 1.16 times higher when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. Among the given options, the closest value is **A) ~1.1**.
