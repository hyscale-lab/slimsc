Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, two astronauts with different masses moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, first, I need to find the relative speed between them. But wait, in relativity, velocity addition isn't straightforward because of the Lorentz factor. Oh right, you can't just subtract the velocities normally.

So, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity—when two objects are moving along the same direction. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, let me get that right. If object A is moving at v1 and object B at v2 in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Or is it (v2 - v1) depending on the frame? Oh wait, in this case, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So, the astronaut moving faster would be ahead, so their relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²). Wait, let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3). So denominator is 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So the first part of the answer is either C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut has relativistic speeds, I need to calculate their relativistic energies and sum them. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, gamma is 1.25, so E1 = gamma * m * c², but the mass is 2m. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c²? Wait, maybe I messed up. Wait, no, the formula is E = gamma * m_rest * c². So the rest mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma * 2m c². Gamma is 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c²? Wait, no, 2m times 1.25 is 2.5 m c². Okay.

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * 3m c². Gamma is ~1.1547, so 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is less than our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity calculation. Let me compute it again. v1=0.6c, v2=0.5c, same direction. So relative speed u is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²).

v1 - v2 = 0.1c.

v1 v2 = 0.6 *0.5 c² = 0.3 c². So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.14286c, which is approximately 0.14c. So yes, that's correct.

So the only option with 0.14c for v_rel and ~5.96 mc² for E is option C.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14286c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\). For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

The energy of the first astronaut is:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

The energy of the second astronaut is:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the only one consistent with \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\) is **Option C**.
