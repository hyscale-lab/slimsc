Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, let me try to think through this. Okay, the question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. So, when you have these infinities, you need a way to make the math work, and regularization is one method to handle that.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right, because classical theories don't really deal with the same kind of infinities as quantum theories. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have renormalization because you're not quantizing the fields. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the divergences that quantum theories face. So maybe D is the answer.

But wait, what about the other options. Let's see. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum theory, so it must have some renormalization. I remember that QED requires regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. So you need to regularize them, maybe using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So C is not the correct answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force. It also is a quantum field theory and deals with things like asymptotic freedom. So QCD definitely has issues with divergences and needs regularization, right? So option B is out.

What about Superstring Theory? Superstring theory is a type of quantum theory as well, trying to unify all forces and particles into a single framework. But wait, strings are different from point particles. In string theory, maybe the infinities are handled differently. Oh, because in string theory, the interactions are between strings, not points, so perhaps the divergent loop integrals are tamed without needing the same kind of regularization. Or wait, I think that in superstring theory, the calculations are finite because the underlying structure of strings avoids some of the divergences. Or am I mixing that up with something else?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Regularization is a part of perturbative methods. In string theory, the perturbative expansion is in terms of genus (like the number of handles in the worldsheet), and each loop order (higher genus) might not have the same divergences as in QFT because the stringy nature modifies the divergences. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization as QED or QCD.

So the question is: which theory never requires regularization. So between D (classical E&M) and A (superstring theory). 

Wait, but the question specifies "at high energies." Hmm. So what happens at high energies in each theory. 

In QED, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the electric charge gets screened because of vacuum polarization. But that's about running coupling, not regularization. But the point is, does the theory require regularization techniques because of divergences regardless of the energy scale? Because even at lower energies, they have divergences that need to be handled.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which of these theories doesn't have to deal with divergences that need regularization, regardless of the energy.

Classical E&M doesn't have quantum divergences, so it doesn't need regularization. So D is correct.

Wait, but what about Superstring theory? Do they require any form of regularization? I'm getting a bit stuck here. From what I remember, in string theory, the perturbation series is different, but there are issues with divergences in certain limits, like when the string coupling is strong. Or maybe the perturbative approach in string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences because the interactions are different. But I think that when you compute loop corrections in string theory, they might not produce the same kind of divergences as in QFT, so maybe regularization isn't needed. Or maybe it's handled differently, like through the string's internal structure.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Is there a theory that doesn't require regularization ever?

Alternatively, maybe all the quantum theories (A, B, C) require regularization, while the classical one (D) doesn't. Because classical theories don't have the same infinities as quantum ones. So the answer would be D.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on whether they involve divergences that necessitate regularization techniques.

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring theory is a quantum theory that unifies fundamental forces and particles. While it deals with high energies and complex interactions, its perturbative framework involves strings rather than point particles. This fundamentally alters the nature of divergences, as string interactions avoid the traditional divergences seen in quantum field theories. However, there are still open questions about whether regularization is required in certain limits, such as when the string coupling is strong. Despite this, it is unclear if superstring theory completely avoids regularization.

### Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)  
QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, is a quantum field theory. Like other quantum field theories, it encounters divergences in loop calculations, particularly at high energies. These divergences require regularization techniques, such as dimensional regularization or cutoff methods. Therefore, QCD does require regularization.

### Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)  
QED is the quantum field theory describing electromagnetic interactions. It is well-known that QED involves divergent loop integrals, which necessitate regularization techniques. Even though QED is relatively simple compared to other quantum field theories, it still requires regularization to handle these divergences.

### Option D: Classical Electrodynamics  
Classical electrodynamics, based on Maxwell's equations, is a non-quantum theory. It does not involve the same type of divergences as quantum field theories because it lacks the quantization of fields and the associated infinities. As a result, classical electrodynamics does not require regularization at any energy scale, including high energies.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, only classical electrodynamics (D) never requires regularization, as it does not encounter the divergences that are typical of quantum field theories. The other theories—superstring theory, QCD, and QED—require regularization to handle divergences, even if superstring theory's divergences are handled differently.
