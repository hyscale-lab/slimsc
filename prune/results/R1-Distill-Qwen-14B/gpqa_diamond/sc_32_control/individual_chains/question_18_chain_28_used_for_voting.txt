Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let's start by understanding the given data. Both stars have masses larger than the Sun's. Star_1 has 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2. But wait, I don't think the mass plays a direct role in this calculation; maybe it's a distractor. The important part is the elemental abundances.

The given abundances are in terms of logarithmic ratios. Let's list what's provided:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, I think I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or is it the other way around? Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

So when [Fe/H] is 0, that means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun. Same for [Mg/H] being 0 for Star_2.

Let me process each star one by one.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → This means that the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe, sun / nH, sun.

What about [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3? That means [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Let me denote the Sun's ratios as follows:

Sun's nFe/nH = 10^(- (7.5 -12)) → Wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe,nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → which is 3.16e-5 approximately.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH_sun = 10^-5 = 1e-5.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the logarithmic ratios given.

So, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H ratio is same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → So, the ratio of Si/Fe in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex.

Wait, the formula is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So if [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, then:

log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

Hmm. So the ratio nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

Wait, but I need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen in each star.

Wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2).

Which is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) = (nSi1 * nH2) / (nH1 * nSi2).

But perhaps another approach is better. Let's compute nSi/nH for each star.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is same as Sun.

We can find [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → so Si/Fe is 10^0.3 times higher than Sun.

But wait, let's think about the Sun's ratios.

In the Sun:

nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

nSi/nFe in the Sun is... Wait, do we have the Sun's [Si/Fe]?

Wait, I don't have it directly. Wait, perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [X/H] is given for Fe and Mg. So for the Sun, [Fe/H] = 0, and [Mg/H] = 0.

Let me think about the Sun's composition:

log(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5 → nFe = nH * 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, log(nMg/nH)_sun = -5 → nMg = nH * 10^(-5).

But what about nSi? Oh, the Sun's nSi isn't directly given. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I can assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? Or not?

Wait, in the Sun, [X/Fe] is the log of the ratio of X to Fe, relative to the solar ratio. So for the Sun, [X/Fe] is zero for X=Fe, and for X=Si, it's [Si/Fe]_sun.

But without knowing [Si/Fe]_sun, perhaps I can't proceed? Or maybe the problem expects us to assume that [Si/Fe]_sun is zero, which would imply that the Sun's Si and Fe abundances are the same. That's probably not correct, but perhaps it's a simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nSi using the other given data.

Wait, looking at Star_2, perhaps I can find nSi there, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express nSi in terms of nFe and nMg.

Wait, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

We also have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

So nSi1/nFe1 = 10^{[Si/Fe]_1} × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But to find nSi1/nH1, I can write:

nSi1 = (nSi1/nFe1) × nFe1.

nFe1 is nFe_sun × (nH1 / nH_sun) * [Fe/H]_1 correction. Wait, no, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH1.

Hmm, but nH1 is the hydrogen abundance of Star_1. Similarly, for Star_2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of the Sun's hydrogen.

Let me denote:

nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) × nH_sun.

Similarly, nMg_sun = 10^(-5) × nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? I don't have that. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero. That would mean nSi_sun / nFe_sun = 1. So nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

But wait, in reality, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is about 0.07, I think. But perhaps for this problem, we can assume it's zero. Because the problem doesn't provide it, perhaps we're to assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, so Si and Fe are the same in the Sun.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to find nSi1 and nSi2 using other given ratios.

Wait, let's think again. The question is to find the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2).

We can express this ratio as (nSi1/nH1) × (nH2/nSi2) = (nSi1 × nH2) / (nH1 × nSi2).

We need expressions for nSi1, nH1, nSi2, nH2.

But we don't have all the data. Let's try to break it down.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 × 10^0.3.

But nFe1 is (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH1.

So nSi1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH1 × 10^0.3.

Similarly, nH1 is the hydrogen in Star_1. But how does that relate to the Sun's hydrogen?

Wait, perhaps the total number of elements (like H) is determined by the star's overall metallicity. But I'm not sure. Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning that the abundance of Fe compared to H is the same as the Sun. But that doesn't necessarily mean that H is the same as the Sun. Hmm, but wait, for stars, [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to hydrogen compared to solar. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Same for any other element. So, for Star_1, the abundances of all elements relative to H are the same as the Sun. Wait, no, because that's not the case. Because the star could have a different overall metallicity. Wait, no, [Fe/H] measures the abundance of Fe relative to H compared to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, Fe is as abundant relative to H as in the Sun. But that doesn't say anything about other elements unless they're compared to Fe.

Wait, perhaps the star has the same overall metallicity as the Sun, but maybe that's not the case. But wait, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so it's solar in Fe/H. So the star's metallicity is the same as the Sun's for Fe. But does that mean that other elements are also the same? Not necessarily, because the star could have different alpha elements (like Mg, Si) abundances.

Wait, but in this case, for Star_1, since [Fe/H] is 0, the Fe/H ratio is same as Sun. But [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so Si is more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

But to find nSi1/nH1: since nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, and nSi1 = nFe1 × 10^0.3, then:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) × nH1 × 10^0.3.

But I can't find nH1 because the problem doesn't give [H] abundance. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should express [Si/H] for Star_1, which would be [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe]. Because [X/H] = [Fe/H] + [X/Fe].

So [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3.

Which means that log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun / nH_sun) = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun / nH_sun).

So nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3.

So log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

Which implies that nMg/nSi in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

But [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so nMg/nSi is 10^0.3 times solar.

We can express nMg in Star_2 as nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) × 10^0.3 × nSi2.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, find [Si/H] for both stars.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3.

So, the abundance of Si relative to H in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. So:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^([Si/H]_1) × (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Wait, no, the correct formula is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) + 0.3.

So, nSi1/nH1 = 10^(0.3) × (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

We need [Si/H]_2. We know [Mg/H]_2 = 0, and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

So, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun /nH_sun).

And [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + 0.3.

But wait, how do we find [Si/H]_2?

Let me think: [Mg/H]_2 is 0, same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → which is log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )= 0.3.

So, nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 × (nMg_sun / nSi_sun).

But also, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

So, let's express nMg2 from the second equation.

nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) × nH2.

And from the [Mg/Si] equation:

nMg2 = 10^0.3 × (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) × nSi2.

Setting these equal:

(nMg_sun / nH_sun) × nH2 = 10^0.3 × (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) × nSi2.

We can cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

(1/nH_sun) × nH2 = 10^0.3 × (1/nSi_sun) × nSi2.

Rearranging:

nH2/nH_sun = 10^0.3 × (nSi2 / nSi_sun).

But I'm not sure if this directly helps. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

Let me think: [X/H] = [Y/H] + [X/Y].

Wait, no, because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

Wait, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Given [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Which means that in Star_2, the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen is 0.3 dex lower than the Sun.

So, log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) - 0.3.

So, nSi2/nH2 = 10^(-0.3) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

Now, I have:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

nSi2/nH2 = 10^(-0.3) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = [10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun)] / [10^(-0.3) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun)].

The (nSi_sun /nH_sun) terms cancel out.

So we're left with 10^(0.3 +0.3) = 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is ~3.9, which aligns with this.

But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recheck.

[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → nSi2/nH2 = 10^-0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So the ratio is (10^0.3 / 10^-0.3) = 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

So the ratio is ~3.9, which is option A.

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have it backwards. Because the question is asking for the ratio of the silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2.

Which is (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2).

Which is (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2 /nSi2).

Which is (nSi1/nH1) × (nH2/nSi2) = [nSi1 × nH2 ] / [nH1 × nSi2].

But wait, from the previous calculation, I found that the ratio of (nSi1/nH1) to (nSi2/nH2) is 10^0.6, which is about 4. So that would mean nSi1/nH1 is higher than nSi2/nH2 by about 4 times. So the ratio is 4.

So the answer should be A) ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between logarithmic ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H ratio is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.
   - Using the relationship [X/H] = [Fe/H] + [X/Fe], we find [Si/H]_1 = 0.3. This means:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_1 = 10^{0.3} \times \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}}.
     \]

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H ratio is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.
   - Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we find [Si/H]_2 = -0.3. This means:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_2 = 10^{-0.3} \times \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}}.
     \]

### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_1}{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_2} = \frac{10^{0.3} \times \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}}}{10^{-0.3} \times \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
\]
The \(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}}\) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_1}{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \(10^{0.6}\), we get:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \approx 3.9.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
