Okay, so I've got this question about a molecular biology experiment, and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. Let me break it down step by step.

So the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the question is about why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up when they looked under the microscope. The experiment involved creating a bicistronic vector with Cre-loxP cassettes, and then they tested it in mice.

First, let's go through the vector construction details. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in one transcript but using internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or something similar to allow translation of both. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so the ligand should be expressed wherever this construct is. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES elements allow for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA without the need for a second promoter. So the mRNA would be ligand followed by IRES then receptor.

But there's more: the ligand has a stop cassette with loxP. So between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think these cassettes are used for Cre-mediated recombination. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre, which is a recombinase enzyme that can excise the DNA between the loxP sites.

So in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, then after ligand, there's a stop cassette. So normally, the ligand would be expressed, and the stop would prevent the receptor from being expressed unless Cre is present to excise the stop.

Similarly, for the receptor, they have an IRES upstream, so the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand. But there's a stop cassette before the eGFP, but using a different lox site (lox2272).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. The vector is a bicistronic construct, so the idea is that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. But how does that work?

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed because the CBA promoter is driving it, but the stop cassette would prevent the expression of the downstream receptor. But in the presence of Cre, the loxP sites would be recognized, and the stop cassette would be excised, allowing the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but in the vector description, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So when Cre recombines, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But wait, the vector is part of a transgenic mouse model. They made a mouse that's homozygous for this construct. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, I think. So the Cre would be expressed under the control of the SOX10 promoter, meaning that Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells.

So the idea is that in the offspring, the Cre would recombine the loxP sites in the vector, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. Then, they look for eGFP expression using confocal microscopy because the receptor is fused to eGFP. But they didn't see any green signal.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But whether that's the case, I'm not sure how that affects the expression in the vector. Maybe if the ligand is secreted, but the vector's setup is about expression in the same cell, right? So maybe not relevant here.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor is not properly trafficked, it might not be on the cell surface. But that would affect the Western blot, perhaps. Wait, they did a Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the construct was expressed, you should see bands. But if the protein is stuck in Golgi, it might not be properly processed, but the Western would still pick up the protein unless there's a trafficking issue. But the question says the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, implying that the proteins were expressed. So maybe B isn't the issue.

Option C: enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter for the second gene. So if the enhancer is missing, expression would be low, but in the presence of Cre, both should be expressed. But the mouse is homozygous, so expression might be high enough. But maybe the CBA promoter isn't sufficient for the receptor? Not sure. Alternatively, if the enhancer is missing in the vector, but I think the CBA promoter is strong enough for constitutive expression. So maybe not the issue.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait, the vector for the receptor includes an IRES, which allows for the translation of the receptor regardless of the upstream stop. But the way the vector is constructed could affect the reading frame. If the stop cassette is between ligand and receptor, perhaps the receptor's ORF is in a different frame than the ligand, but that shouldn't matter if the IRES is correctly placed. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is in the same ORF as the receptor. Wait, no, the question says the receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor's coding sequence is followed by eGFP in frame? Or is the eGFP separate?

Wait, the vector is ligand (mCherry) first, then an IRES, then receptor (with eGFP at the C-terminus). But there's a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP. Oh wait, the question says between the receptor and eGFP is the lox2272 stop cassette. So the structure is:

5' - CBA promoter - ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP - 3'

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (with mCherry) because the CBA promoter drives it. The stop cassette would prevent the downstream IRES and receptor from being expressed. But when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassettes. So the Cre would cut the loxP sites around the stop cassettes. So ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and the IRES would allow the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the case of the mouse, they crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. So in neural crest cells, Cre is active. That should allow the stop cassettes to be excised, leading to expression of both ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP).

But when they looked, they saw no green signal. So why?

Looking at the options again, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop cassette was in between the receptor and eGFP, and when Cre excises the stop, perhaps the coding sequence isn't correctly spliced. If the eGFP is inserted into the same ORF as the receptor, but the stop cassette was in the way, maybe removing it would cause a frame shift, making the eGFP not in frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein or no expression.

Wait, but typically, when you have a stop cassette between the ORF and the tag, and then remove it, the ORF continues into the tag. So the lox2272 cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So the receptor's ORF is there, followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP. When Cre deletes the stop, the receptor's ORF is joined to eGFP. But if the eGFP is in frame, then you have a fusion protein: receptor followed by eGFP.

Wait, but sometimes, the stop cassette may contain a 'stop' codon, but when excised, the ORF would continue into the next part. So if the excision is done correctly, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame. But if it's not done correctly, maybe the reading frame is off, leading to a premature stop or no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF. But the vector description says the receptor is fused to eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP is appended to the C-terminus of the receptor, meaning it's in the same reading frame.

If the vector's construction caused the eGFP to be out of frame, then the receptor would be expressed but without eGFP, or the eGFP would not be expressed, or a truncated version.

But how does that affect the Western blot? They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the receptor-eGFP is expressed, the antibody should detect it. But if eGFP isn't in frame, maybe the epitope isn't there, but the receptor's protein would still be present. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is needed for detection, but the Western blot uses specific antibodies against the proteins, not the GFP.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So in the vector, each is a fusion. But when they do the Western blot, they're using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the proteins are expressed, the antibodies would detect them. So if the Western blot showed a signal, then the proteins are being expressed.

So the fact that the Western blot gives a signal proportional to actin loading suggests that the proteins (ligand and receptor) are successfully expressed. But in the live mouse, they didn't see any green fluorescence.

So the eGFP isn't being expressed, or the construct isn't being activated in the right cells.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous, and they crossed it with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre should be active in neural crest-derived cells, which would activate the construct. So why no green?

If the eGFP is not expressed, perhaps the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. Or perhaps the eGFP isn't being correctly expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. If the stop cassette was in between, and Cre didn't excise it correctly, perhaps the receptor is not being expressed. But the Western blot suggests that the proteins are expressed.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, meaning both ligand and receptor should be expressed if Cre is active. So if the Western blot shows the proteins, but the eGFP isn't visible under the microscope, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly processed. For example, if the vector is designed so that the eGFP is under a different promoter or something. Or perhaps the eGFP is not correctly inserted into the construct.

Wait, looking again at the vector structure: The ligand is under CBA, followed by the stop cassette, then IRES, then receptor, then another stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The ligand is under CBA, then there's a stop cassette with loxP, then mCherry. Then an IRES, then the receptor, then a stop cassette with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, that's possible. So the structure is:

CBA promoter → ligand ORF → loxP-stop-loxP → mCherry → IRES → receptor ORF → lox2272-stop-lox2272 → eGFP.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (CBA is active), and the stop after ligand prevents mCherry from being expressed? No, wait, no. The ligand is fused to mCherry. So the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF.

Wait, no, wait. The way it's described: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So the ligand's coding sequence is followed by mCherry, but with a stop cassette in between. So when Cre is not present, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, because the stop is not functional. But wait, no, let me think.

Wait, the loxP-stop-loxP cassette is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So without Cre, the stop is present, so mCherry isn't expressed. But if you have Cre, the stop is excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed along with the ligand. Oh, wait, I think I'm mixing up. Because the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF. Or are they separate?

Wait, the ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry. So maybe the ligand is in frame with mCherry, so the same ORF. So in the absence of Cre, the stop is between ligand and mCherry, so the ligand is expressed (with mCherry), but if the stop is in between, perhaps they're not. Hmm, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the ligand is in its own ORF, and mCherry is in another, but the stop cassette prevents the expression of mCherry unless Cre excises it.

Wait, perhaps the vector is such that the ligand is under a promoter, and mCherry is in another cassette. But the description says the ligand is fused to mCherry. So perhaps in the vector, the ligand is cloned so that upon expression, the ligand is produced as a fusion protein with mCherry. So when Cre is present, the stop cassette is removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand.

Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the eGFP to be expressed as part of the receptor.

But if the eGFP isn't in frame, perhaps the protein isn't expressed correctly. So option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, causing no eGFP expression.

If that's the case, then the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't, so in the Western blot, you'd see the receptor, but not eGFP. However, the question states that the Western blot showed a signal proportional to actin loading, which I think suggests that the proteins were expressed. But it's possible that the eGFP wasn't part of the blot. Wait, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which probably includes both ligand and receptor. So the Western would detect both, if expressed.

But in the mouse, when they use SOX10-Cre, the Cre should activate the vector, allowing the expression of both the ligand (with mCherry) and the receptor (with eGFP). If the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP would not be expressed, so the receptor would be expressed, but not eGFP.

So when they look under the microscope for eGFP, they see nothing. Because the eGFP isn't expressed. That's why no green signal.

So the reason is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so it's not expressed. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but why would the presence of the stop cassette affect the frame? If the stop cassette is in between, and Cre excises it, then the frame would be maintained. Unless the loxP sites are in the middle of an exon, causing a frame shift upon excision. Oh wait, that's possible.

So suppose the stop cassette is within the coding sequence. When Cre excises it, the remaining exons would have to be in frame. If the loxP sites are within the ORF, excising them could disrupt the reading frame. For example, if the loxP sites are in the middle of a codon, removing them would delete some nucleotides and cause a frameshift, leading to a completely different reading frame downstream. So the eGFP would be inserted in a different frame, leading to no functional eGFP.

But in the vector design, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So perhaps the stop is designed in such a way that when Cre excises it, the receptor's ORF continues into the eGFP in the same frame. If the vector wasn't correctly designed, the eGFP could be in a different frame, making the eGFP not expressed or making a nonfunctional protein.

In that case, the Western blot would detect the receptor (since the receptor's ORF is intact and expressed), but the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so the confocal wouldn't show any green.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working, but the question states that the vector has an IRES regulatory element upstream of the receptor. IRES elements are known to drive the expression of a second ORF without a promoter, so that shouldn't be the issue if Cre is active.

So the most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, meaning D is the correct answer.

The question involves a bicistronic vector designed to express a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The vector includes a CBA promoter driving the ligand ORF, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, mCherry, an IRES element, the receptor ORF, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, and eGFP. The experiment involves crossing a mouse homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre recombinase, which excises the stop cassettes and allows expression of both the ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP). However, no green signal from eGFP was observed under confocal microscopy, despite Western blot confirming protein expression proportional to actin loading.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option is irrelevant to the issue at hand. The question focuses on the expression of the eGFP-tagged receptor, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor.

2. **Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would likely still be detected in the Western blot. The absence of a green signal under the microscope does not necessarily indicate a trafficking issue, as the Western blot suggests proper expression of the proteins.

3. **Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under an IRES element, which does not require additional enhancers. The absence of an enhancer is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The vector design places the eGFP after the receptor ORF, with a stop cassette (lox2272) in between. If the stop cassette is not properly excised or if the excision disrupts the reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This would result in the receptor being expressed but not fused to eGFP, explaining the absence of a green signal under the microscope while still allowing detection of the receptor in the Western blot.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to improper expression of the eGFP-tagged receptor. This aligns with the observation of no green signal under the microscope despite protein expression confirmed by Western blot.
