Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X=8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right! The formula for the mean decay distance is c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (beta*c) of the particle. So, mean decay distance L = c * tau * beta.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh yeah, the mean path length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Or wait, is it just beta * gamma * c * tau? Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for time dilation. So the mean lifetime from the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0). So L is beta * gamma * c * tau_0, which is the same as gamma * beta * c * tau_0. But in this case, tau is the lifetime, which already incorporates gamma? Or is tau the proper lifetime? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think the mean decay length is given by L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau, where tau is the mean proper lifetime. But wait, in particle physics, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Specifically, Γ = ħ / tau, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, no. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime tau by the relation Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. But let me make sure about the units. Gamma is in MeV, and the Planck constant has units of MeV·s if I'm not mistaken. So when I compute tau, it'll be in seconds.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Compute the lifetime tau using tau = ħ / Γ.
2. Compute the velocity beta and gamma of the meson.
3. Then compute the decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but wait. The meson is produced with energy E. So E = gamma m c^2. Oh, right! Because the total energy of a relativistic particle is gamma m c². So gamma can be found from E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, energy E is given in GeV, mass m in GeV/c², so when I compute gamma, the c² will cancel out.

Let me plug in the numbers. E_X is 8 GeV. Mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 /1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Approximately 6.6667.

But wait, hold on. Units are a bit tricky. Let's make sure. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So, E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since E and m are in units where c² is 1 (like GeV and GeV/c²), this would mean gamma is E/(m) = 8 /1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the velocity beta. Beta is v/c. To find beta, we can use gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So 1/gamma² = 1 - beta². So beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Let me compute that. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666667. So gamma squared is (6.666666667)^2 ≈ 44.44444444. So 1/gamma² ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Beta squared is 0.9775, so beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Let me compute that more accurately.

Calculating sqrt(0.9775): well, 0.9887^2 = approximately 0.9775. So beta ≈ 0.9887. So about 0.9887c.

Now, the proper lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. Let's compute that. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact value. Let me think: ħ is about 197.33 MeV·fm (femto meters), but I'm more familiar with ħ in GeV·s. Wait, no, I'm confusing it with the value in other units. Let me get this straight.

Wait, I think ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and 1 eV·s is about 6.582e-16 eV·s (as Planck's constant divided by 2pi is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s, so in eV·s, it's approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the value of ħ in GeV·seconds.

Yes, ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So, tau = ħ / Γ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, units: Γ is in MeV, so we need to convert it to GeV. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s. Let's compute 6.582 / 0.32.

6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s. Or 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 = approx 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So tau is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau. Let me compute each part.

Gamma is 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6666667.

Beta is approximately 0.9887.

c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So let's compute each term:

gamma * beta ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute that:

6.6666667 * 0.9887.

Hmm, 6.6666667 * 1 is 6.6666667, so subtract 6.6666667 * 0.0113 (since 1-0.9887=0.0113).

0.0113 *6.6666667 ≈ 0.0755555.

So 6.6666667 -0.0755555 ≈ 6.59111.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.59111.

Then, multiply by c and tau.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Now, multiply by gamma*beta: 6.59111 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.59111 *6.170625e-16.

Let me compute 6 *6=36, but more accurately:

6.59111 *6.170625 = let's compute 6.59111 *6=39.54666, 6.59111 *0.170625≈ about 1.1244. So total ≈ 40.671.

So 40.671e-16 m = 4.0671e-15 m.

Wait, wait, no. Wait the product is 6.59111 *6.170625e-16. So 6.59111 *6.170625 is approximately 40.671, so 40.671e-16 m is 4.0671e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, wait, but my calculation got ≈4.067e-15 m. So which option is closer?

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close. So the likely answer is B.

But wait, perhaps I made an approximation in beta. Let me double-check the exact value of beta.

I approximated beta as 0.9887, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Gamma = 8/(1.2) = 6.666666667.

So gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.44444444.

So beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - 9/400 = (400-9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

0.9775 is between 0.9801 (0.99^2) and 0.9604 (0.98^2). Wait, no, 0.98^2=0.9604. 0.99^2=0.9801. 0.9887^2= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2= 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017148 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97762369. Oh wait, that's very close to 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, as I thought earlier.

So beta is 0.9887.

So gamma * beta is 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.59111.

Hmm, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Let me compute 6.666666667 * 0.9887:

6.666666667 * 0.9887.

Compute 6.666666667 *0.9 = 6.0

6.666666667 *0.08 = 0.533333333

6.666666667 *0.0087 = 0.058000000002

Add them together: 6.0 + 0.533333333 =6.533333333, plus 0.058 → 6.591333333.

So gamma*beta ≈ 6.591333333.

Now, let's compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, multiply by gamma*beta: 6.591333333 * 6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.591333333 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6 *6 = 36, but more accurately:

6 *6.170625 = 37.02375.

0.591333333 *6.170625 ≈ Let's compute that.

6.170625 * 0.5 =3.0853125.

6.170625 *0.091333333 ≈ approx 0.56333333.

So 3.0853125 +0.56333333 ≈3.64864583.

Adding to 37.02375: 37.02375 +3.64864583 ≈40.67239583.

So 40.67239583e-16 m = 4.067239583e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0672e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, could it be that I missed a factor somewhere? Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the decay length using L = (E * c * tau)/(m). Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). So L = gamma * beta * c * tau = (E/(m c²)) * beta * c * tau.

Which is (E beta c tau)/(m c²) ) = (E beta tau)/(m c).

But tau is ħ / Γ, so:

L = (E beta ħ )/( m c Γ )

Wait, let me see. Alternatively, perhaps using more precise constants.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact Planck constant value. Let me double-check ħ.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Alternatively, in other units, but this value is correct. So tau is ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the product gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, let me write it all in terms of numbers.

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 9/(400)) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = ħ/Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

So:

gamma * beta = 6.666666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.59133.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = 6.59133 * 6.170625e-16 = ?

Wait, 6.59133 *6.170625e-16 = (6.59133 *6.170625) e-16.

Compute 6.59133 *6.170625:

6 *6.170625 =37.02375

0.59133 *6.170625 ≈ let's compute that.

0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.09133 *6.170625 ≈0.562919 (since 6.170625 *0.09 is 0.555356, 0.00133 *6.170625 ≈0.008219, total ≈0.555356 +0.008219=0.563575.)

So total 3.0853125 +0.563575 ≈3.6488875.

So total 37.02375 +3.6488875≈40.6726375.

So 40.6726375e-16 m =4.06726375e-15 m ≈4.0673e-15 m.

Looking at the options again:

Option B is 4.0655 *1e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm. My calculated value is about 4.0673e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15). The small difference might be due to more precise beta or other constants.

Wait, perhaps in calculating beta, I should use more precise numbers. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Compute beta = sqrt(0.9775).

0.9775 is 0.9775.

So, sqrt(0.9775) can be calculated using the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me approximate it.

Let me take x0 = 0.9887. x0² = 0.97752569 ≈0.97752569.

Which is a bit more than 0.9775 (0.00002569 over). So to find x where x²=0.9775.

x1 = (x0 + (0.9775 - x0²)/(2 x0)).

So x0² =0.9887^2= let's compute 0.9887 *0.9887:

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.008526.

0.0087 *0.98= 0.008526.

0.0087 *0.0087= ~0.00007569.

So 0.98^2 =0.9604.

(0.98+0.0087)^2 =0.98² + 2 *0.98 *0.0087 +0.0087² = 0.9604 +0.017148 +0.00007569= 0.97762369.

So x0^2=0.97762369, but we need 0.9775, which is less. The difference is 0.97752369 -0.9775=0.00002369. Wait, wait, no: 0.97762369 is larger than 0.9775, so x0 is a bit too high.

So newton raphson step:

f(x) =x² -0.9775=0.

f'(x)=2x.

x1 = x0 - (x0^2 -0.9775)/(2 x0).

x0=0.9887.

x0²=0.97762369.

f(x0)=0.97762369 -0.9775=0.00012369.

x1=0.9887 - (0.00012369)/(2 * 0.9887) = 0.9887 - (0.00012369)/(1.9774).

Compute denominator: 1.9774.

0.00012369 /1.9774 ≈ 6.26e-5.

So x1=0.9887 -0.0000626= 0.9886374.

Check x1^2.

x1 =0.9886374.

x1^2: let's compute.

0.9886 *0.9886 = ?

(0.9886)^2 = (approx) (0.98)^2 + 2*0.98*0.0086 + (0.0086)^2.

0.98²=0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0086=0.017272.

(0.0086)^2=0.00007396.

Sum: 0.9604 +0.017272=0.977672 +0.00007396=0.97774596.

Wait, but that's higher than 0.9775. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait x1 is 0.9886374.

Compute x1 squared: let's calculate 0.9886374 * 0.9886374.

Using calculator steps:

0.9886374 × 0.9886374.

Well, 0.9886 *0.9886 = approx 0.9773 as before, but perhaps more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that beta is approximately 0.9886374, and use that. Let me compute gamma * beta again with this more precise beta.

gamma is 6.666666667.

beta is 0.9886374.

gamma * beta = 6.666666667 * 0.9886374 ≈6.666666667 *0.9886374.

Compute 6 *0.9886374=5.9318244.

0.666666667 *0.9886374≈0.666666667 *0.9886374.

Compute 0.666666667 *0.9886374.

0.6 *0.9886374=0.59318244.

0.066666667 *0.9886374≈0.06589.

Adding up: 0.59318244 +0.06589≈0.65907.

So total gamma * beta =5.9318244 +0.65907≈6.5908944.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5908944.

Now, c * tau =3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s=6.170625e-16 m.

So L =6.5908944 *6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.5908944 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6.5908944 *6.170625.

6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.5908944 *6.170625 = ?

0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.0908944 *6.170625≈ let's compute.

0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625.

0.0008944 *6.170625≈0.005514.

So 0.55535625 +0.005514≈0.56087025.

Adding 3.0853125 +0.56087025=3.64618275.

Total 37.02375 +3.64618275=40.66993275.

So 40.66993275e-16 m =4.066993275e-15 m.

So approximately 4.067e-15 m. The options are:

B)4.0655e-15 m.

C)5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, my calculation is about 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15). The difference is about 1.5e-16 m, which is negligible considering the approximations.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau \) (proper lifetime)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) (Lorentz factor)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \),

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \) (velocity as a fraction of \( c \))
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \) (mean decay distance)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting:
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

\[
L = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Next, compute \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = (6.5913)(6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated value of \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding during intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
