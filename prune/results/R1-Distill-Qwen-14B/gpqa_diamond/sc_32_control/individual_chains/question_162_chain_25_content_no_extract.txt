Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I'm trying to recall what kind of geometry this represents. Oh right, when a metric is conformally flat like this, it's usually a 2-dimensional space embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere or a pseudosphere.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? So it's kind of like a saddle shape. But I'm not sure how that ties into the metric given here.

I remember that in general, the metric can be written in terms of a conformal factor. The general form is ds² = e^(2f) (dx² + dy²), where f is some function. In this case, the conformal factor is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)), but wait, actually the given metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] multiplied by (dx² + dy²), so the conformal factor squared is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the function in the exponent would be (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)), or something like that. But maybe I don't need the exact function unless I'm calculating curvature.

So the question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. I'm a bit confused about what the area of a pseudosphere is. From what I remember, for a regular sphere, the area is 4πr². But pseudospheres are different since they have negative curvature.

Wait, but wait a second. How is this metric related to a pseudosphere? Let me think. The term 'pseudosphere' sometimes can refer to a specific surface in geometry, but in the context of general relativity or differential geometry, it might be a 2-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature. So maybe the metric given here is describing such a surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric describes a hyperbolic plane, which is a 2D space with constant negative curvature. But a pseudosphere is more like a finite area surface, right? Wait, no, hyperbolic space is infinite. So maybe the pseudosphere in this question refers to a compactified or finite version, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the denominator in the metric is (4 - x² - y²). So the domain of this metric is where 4 - x² - y² is positive, because otherwise you'd have a negative or zero denominator, which would make the metric undefined or singular. So x² + y² <4, meaning that the coordinates x and y are constrained within a circle of radius 2 in the plane. So the radius here is 2, matching the question's radius r=2.

So the surface described by this metric is a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in some higher-dimensional space, possibly like a sphere. But wait, in 3D, a sphere has positive curvature, but a pseudosphere has negative. Alternatively, maybe this metric is of a sphere with radius 2?

Wait, no, because the denominator 4 - x² - y². If I think of x and y as coordinates in a plane, the condition x² + y² <4 would make the domain a disk of radius 2. So perhaps this is a representation of a sphere with radius 2. Wait, but if the denominator is 4, that's (2)^2, so maybe it's a sphere of radius 2.

But the question is about a pseudosphere. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe this is a metric for a hyperbolic plane, but I'm not sure. Wait, hyperbolic space would have a different form. The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)^2, where R is the curvature radius. Let me compare that to the given metric. The given metric has [32/(4 - x² - y²)] as the factor. Let me factor that denominator: 4 - (x² + y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the denominator is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) )= 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4).

So the metric becomes ds² = [8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] (dx² + dy²). Comparing to the standard hyperbolic metric, which is 1/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)^2 times (dx² + dy²), but here we have 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the standard hyperbolic metric is ds² = [1/( (1 - (x² + y²)/R²) )^2 ] (dx² + dy²). So our given metric is [8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] (dx² + dy²), which is 8 times [1/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)].

Wait, so the standard hyperbolic metric has a denominator (1 - (x² + y²)/R²) squared. So in our case, we have 1/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) to the first power, multiplied by 8. So that suggests that this is not the standard hyperbolic metric because the exponent is different. Hmm, so perhaps this is not hyperbolic but something else.

Alternatively, maybe this is a conformally flat metric, and the Gaussian curvature can be found from the conformal factor. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think for a metric like ds² = e^{2f} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by -e^{-2f} ( (e^{2f})_xx + (e^{2f})_yy ), or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, the Gaussian curvature K is related to the function f. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is K = - (1/2) e^{-2f} [ (∂²f/∂x²) + (∂²f/∂y²) ) ].

But maybe I can compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric to see if it's constant, which would indicate a pseudosphere.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in terms of e^{2f}, e^{2f} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So f = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Compute the second derivatives of f with respect to x and y.

Let me compute f = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - x² - y²).

So the first derivative of f with respect to x is [ (0) - (1/2) * ( -2x ) / (4 - x² - y²) ) ] = (x)/(4 - x² - y²).

Similarly, the second derivative f_xx would be [ (4 - x² - y²) * 1 - x * (-2x) ] / (4 -x² - y²)^2.

Wait, applying the quotient rule: d/dx [x/(4 - x² - y²)] = [ (1)(4 - x² - y²) - x*(-2x) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So numerator is (4 -x² -y²) + 2x² = 4 + x² - y².

Similarly, f_yy would be the same as f_xx, since y appears similarly. So f_yy = [ (4 -x² - y²) + 2 y² ] / (4 -x² - y²)^2 = (4 -x² + y²) / denominator.

So then, the sum f_xx + f_yy is [ (4 + x² - y²) + (4 -x² + y²) ] / (4 -x² - y²)^2.

Simplify numerator: 4 +x² - y² +4 -x² + y² = 8.

So f_xx + f_yy = 8/(4 - x² - y²)^2.

Now, Gaussian curvature K = - (1/2) e^{-2f} (f_xx + f_yy).

But e^{2f} is 32/(4 -x² - y²), so e^{-2f} is (4 -x² - y²)/32.

So K = - (1/2) * (4 -x² - y²)/(32) * [8/(4 -x² - y²)^2) ].

Simplify this:

K = - (1/2) * (4 - x² - y²) * 8 / (32 * (4 -x² - y²)^2 )

Simplify the constants: 8/(32) = 1/4; (4 -x² - y²) in the numerator cancels with one in the denominator, leaving (4 -x² - y²) in the denominator as squared.

Wait, let me compute that again:

(4 -x² - y²) in the numerator, and denominator is (4 -x² - y²)^2, so  (4 -x² - y²) / (4 -x² - y²)^2) = 1/(4 -x² - y²).

So K = - (1/2) * (1/4) * [8/(4 -x² - y²)^2) ] * (4 -x² - y²) ?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recast:

K = - (1/2) * e^{-2f} * (f_xx + f_yy)
= - (1/2) * [ (4 -x² -y²)/32 ] * [ 8/(4 -x² -y²)^2 ) ]

Multiply these terms:

(4 -x² -y²) * 8 = 8(4 - x² - y²)
Denominator: 32 * (4 -x² - y²)^2.

So K = - (1/2) * [8(4 -x² - y²) ] / [32 (4 -x² - y²)^2 ) ]

Simplify the 8/32 = 1/4.

And (4 -x² -y²) in numerator and (4 -x² -y²)^2 in denominator gives 1/(4 -x² - y²).

So K = - (1/2) * (1/4) * [ 1/(4 -x² - y²) ) ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute again.

After factoring everything:

K = - (1/2) * [ (4 -x² -y²) * 8 ] / [32 (4 -x² - y²)^2 ) ]

Factor of 8/32 = 1/4.

The (4 -x² -y²) in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving 1/(4 -x² - y²) in denominator.

Wait, actually:

The numerator is (4 -x² -y²) * 8.
Denominator is 32 * (4 -x² -y²)^2.

So 8/32 = 1/4.

The (4 -x² -y²) in numerator cancels with one (4 -x² -y²) in denominator, leaving (4 -x² -y²) in denominator.

So K = - (1/2) * (1/4) * [1/(4 -x² -y²) ]

So K = - (1/(8)) * [1/(4 -x² -y²) ]

Hmm, but that's variable-dependent. So the curvature isn't constant, which suggests this isn't a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature), but maybe a surface with varying curvature.

Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of K.

Wait, the formula for Gaussian curvature K is:

K = -e^{-2f} [ (∂²f/∂x²) + (∂²f/∂y²) ) ]

Wait, no, I think I might have confused the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = -e^{-2f} [ (f_x)^2 + (f_y)^2 ] ? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, I think the correct formula is K = -e^{-2f} [ (f_{xx} + f_{yy}) ) ].

Wait, let me look it up mentally. For a metric in conformal coordinates, ds² = e^{2f} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - e^{-2f} [ ( (e^{2f})_{xx} + (e^{2f})_{yy} ) ) / 2 ]

Wait, maybe that's a better way to compute it. Because e^{2f} is our conformal factor, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32 (4 - x² - y²)^{-1}.

So compute (e^{2f})_{xx} and (e^{2f})_{yy}.

Compute (e^{2f})_{xx} = d/dx [ d/dx (32/(4 -x² - y²) ) ]

First derivative with respect to x: 32 * d/dx [ (4 -x² - y²)^{-1} ) ] = 32 * (-1) * (-2x) (4 -x² - y²)^{-2} ) = 64x (4 -x² - y²)^{-2}.

Second derivative: d/dx [64x (4 - x² - y²)^{-2} ].

Apply product rule: 64 (4 -x² - y²)^{-2} + 64x * (-2) * (-2x) (4 -x² - y²)^{-3} )

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Let me denote u = 4 - x² - y².

So first derivative: 64x / u².

Second derivative: d/dx [64x u^{-2} ] = 64 u^{-2} + 64x * (-2) u^{-3} (-2x).

Wait, no, let's compute it properly. The derivative is:

d/dx [64x u^{-2} ] = 64 u^{-2} + 64x * d/dx(u^{-2}) )

d/dx(u^{-2}) = (-2) u^{-3} * du/dx = (-2) u^{-3} * (-2x) )= 4x u^{-3}.

So putting it together: 64 u^{-2} + 64x * (4x u^{-3} ) = 64 u^{-2} + 256 x² u^{-3}.

Similarly, the same applies for the y-derivative.

So (e^{2f})_{xx} = 64 u^{-2} + 256 x² u^{-3}.

Similarly, (e^{2f})_{yy} = 64 u^{-2} + 256 y² u^{-3}.

So the sum (e^{2f})_{xx} + (e^{2f})_{yy} is:

[64 u^{-2} + 256 x² u^{-3}] + [64 u^{-2} +256 y² u^{-3} ]

= 128 u^{-2} + 256 (x² + y²) u^{-3}.

So the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = -(1/2) e^{-2f} [ (e^{2f})_{xx} + (e^{2f})_{yy} ) / 2 ].

Wait, no, the formula is K = - e^{-2f} [ ( (e^{2f})_{xx} + (e^{2f})_{yy} ) / 2 ]

So,

K = - e^{-2f} [ (128 u^{-2} + 256 (x² + y²) u^{-3}) ) / 2 ]

= - e^{-2f} [64 u^{-2} + 128 (x² + y²) u^{-3} ]

But e^{-2f} is u/32, because e^{2f} = 32 u^{-1}, so e^{-2f} = u/(32).

So substituting:

K = - [ (u/32) * [64 u^{-2} + 128 (x² + y²) u^{-3} ] ]

= - [ (u/32) [64 / u² + 128 (x² + y²)/u^3 ] ]

= - [ (u/32) * (64 + 128 (x² + y²)/u ) / u^2 ]

Wait, perhaps I should just compute each term:

First term: (u/32) * 64 u^{-2} = 64 u / (32 u²) )= (64 /32 ) * (1/u) )= 2 * (1/u).

Second term: (u/32) * 128 (x² + y²) u^{-3} )= 128 (x² + y²) u / (32 u^3 ) )= (128/32 ) * (x² + y²) / u² )= 4 (x² + y²) / u².

So K = - [2/u + 4 (x² + y²)/u² ]

But u =4 - x² - y².

So,

K = - [ 2/(4 -x² -y²) + 4 (x² + y^2)/(4 -x² -y^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, this isn't a constant. So the Gaussian curvature K varies with x and y, which suggests that this isn't a pseudosphere, which should have constant negative curvature. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. I'm a bit confused about whether the given metric represents a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sphere. Let me think about the area of a pseudosphere.

Wait, in general, for a pseudosphere, I think the area is finite. Wait, but wait, the surface area of a pseudosphere is actually infinite? No, I thought it was finite, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the regular sphere has a finite area. But a pseudosphere, which is a surface of negative curvature, perhaps it's like an infinite horn, so its area could be infinite. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: in 2D, the area of a surface with metric ds² can be computed by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. In this case, the metric is diagonal with both components equal to sqrt(32/(4 -x² - y²)), so the determinant is [32/(4 -x² - y²)] * [32/(4 -x² - y²)] - 0 = [32/(4 -x² - y²)]^2. Wait, no, wait. The metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 -x² - y²)) * (32/(4 -x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2/(4 -x² -y²)^2. So the square root of the determinant is 32/(4 -x² - y²).

So the area element is (32/(4 -x² -y²)) dx dy.

So the area would be the double integral over the region x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 -x² -y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral. Let me see if I can compute it. Let's switch to polar coordinates, since the integrand and the domain are circularly symmetric.

x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So dx dy = r dr dθ.

The integrand becomes 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

So the area is ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr.

Compute the integral:

First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So area = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r^2) ) = 32 ∫ [ (r dr)/u ] 
= 32 ∫ ( - du/2 ) / u 
= -16 ∫ (du/u )
= -16 ln|u| + C.

Now evaluate from r=0 to r=2.

At r=2, u=4 -4=0. At r=0, u=4.

So the integral is [ -16 ln|u| ] from 0 to 2:

= [ -16 ln(0) ) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. If the area is infinite, then the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Or maybe I'm mixing them up with other surfaces. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere but a different surface.

Wait, but in my calculation, the area integral diverges because near r=2, the denominator approaches zero. The integrand behaves like (32 r)/(4 - r^2) ≈ (32 r)/(4) =8r as r approaches 2 from below. So integrating 8r dr from 0 to2 would give a finite result, but wait in our substitution, the integral becomes -16 ln(u), which at u=0 is ln(0) → -infty. So the integral is divergent.

So the area would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 0
B)4π(x² + y²)
C)4π(x² - y²)
D)+infty.

So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, why is the area infinite? Because the metric's domain is a disk of radius 2, but the area element blows up at the boundary. So the surface described by this metric has infinite area. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere (if this is indeed a pseudosphere) would be infinite, so answer D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to determine the area of the pseudosphere with radius \(r = 2\). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Domain of the Metric**: The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the coordinates \((x, y)\) are restricted to the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the plane.

2. **Conformal Factor**: The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor being \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). This suggests that the geometry is related to a surface with variable curvature.

3. **Gaussian Curvature**: To determine the nature of the surface, the Gaussian curvature \(K\) was computed. The curvature was found to depend on \(x\) and \(y\), indicating that the surface does not have constant curvature. This rules out the possibility of the surface being a pseudosphere, which requires constant negative curvature.

4. **Area Calculation**: The area element for the metric is \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

   Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:

   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

   The total area is then:

   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

   Substituting \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral simplifies to:

   \[
   A = 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 2\pi \cdot \left[-16 \ln|4 - r^2|\right]_0^2.
   \]

   Evaluating the limits, as \(r \to 2\), \(\ln|4 - r^2| \to \ln(0) \to -\infty\), leading to a divergent integral. Thus, the area is infinite.

### Conclusion:
The area of the surface described by the given metric is infinite. This aligns with the fact that the area element diverges near the boundary \(r = 2\), where the denominator \(4 - r^2\) approaches zero.

### Answer:
D) \(+\infty\)
