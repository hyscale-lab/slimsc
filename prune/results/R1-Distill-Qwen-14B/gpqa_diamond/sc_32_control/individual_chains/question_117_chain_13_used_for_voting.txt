Okay, so I've got this question about isomers, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question gives four compounds and asks which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four.

First, I remember that optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So, if a compound has at least one such carbon, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers would rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, hence optical isomerism.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. Wait, the substituents are on the 6 and 2 positions. But more importantly, do any of the carbons here have four different groups attached? The central biphenyl structure—maybe the carbons attached to the ester groups? Let me think. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So each of those carbons (the ones attached to the ester groups) are connected to the OMe group, the carbonyl, and two other substituents. Wait, but in a biphenyl, the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is probably connected to two phenyl groups. No, wait, the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'. So each of those is a single bond between the two benzene rings. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, maybe the ester groups are at positions 2 and 2'. So the molecule is symmetrical in some way. But wait, that might not matter. Let's consider the central carbon. If the two rings are connected by a single bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are in certain positions. But wait, the substituents are 6 and 6' (same positions on each ring) and 2 and 2' on each as well. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So each of the rings is substituted in similar positions. So the molecule as a whole might be symmetrical. But wait, the question is about whether any carbon in the molecule has four different groups attached.

Another possibility is the ester groups. Each ester is OMe connected to a carbonyl. Let's think about the carbons attached to the ester groups. The ester is O-CO-OCH3. The carbonyl carbon is connected to two oxygens (from the ester groups) and perhaps other substituents. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, the biphenyl system itself—could the single bond between the two benzene rings allow for rotation, leading to cis and trans isomerism? But that's geometric isomerism, not optical. Oh, but wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. So for optical isomerism, the molecule should lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Alternatively, any chiral centers would lead to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the 6,6'-dinitro groups are in such positions that they create asymmetry. Let me visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. The 2 position is next to the point where the two rings are connected (position 1). So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Since the rings are connected at 1 and 1', perhaps the overall structure is symmetrical. But that might depend on how the substituents are arranged.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so it's not chiral. So maybe compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. Because if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So maybe 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Moving on.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(CH3)OH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the propanoate has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO–. So if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is HOCH2COO–, but as an ester, it's OMe attached to the carbonyl. So the molecule is MeO-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's structure it correctly.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO–. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-COO–. So as an ester, it's MeO-CO-CH2-OH? Wait, no, wait. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

The central carbon is the one attached to the ester group. Let me see: the propanoate part is CH2CH2COO–. So the two carbons are:

The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is attached to OMe, and the adjacent CH2 group has a hydroxyl group. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no—the propanoate is CH2CH2COO–. So the carboxylate is attached to the end, so the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
|
O-C-OCH3 (ester group)
|
CH2-CHOH-CH3? No, wait. Maybe it's:

The structure is:

The propanoate is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2-CH2-OH group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the structure is:

The ester is OMe connected to a carbonyl, which is connected to a CH2-CH(OH)- group. So the carbon next to the carbonyl is CH2, and the next is CH(OH). So the carbon attached directly to the carbonyl is CH2, and that's connected to another CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is (HOCH2)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (connected to the carbonyl) is CH2, and the adjacent is CH2-OH. Wait, no, maybe the structure is:

The propanoate is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon (the middle one). So the carbon chain is COOCH3-CH2-CH(OH)-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is the ester group. Then the next carbon is CH2- and then another CH(OH) group attached. Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The molecule is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the chain is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- CH2 (to the previous carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH2? No, wait, the structure is:

The ester is OMe attached to a carbonyl (COO). The carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to another CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would have the structure: the ester is OCH3 connected to a carbonyl, which is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to another CH3? Or perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is connected to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 group. Wait, no—that would make it a 3-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is at the end, and the adjacent carbon (the alpha carbon) is CH2, which is connected to a CH(OH) group. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbonyl is on the third carbon (the end), and the hydroxyl is on the first (alpha) carbon.

Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the second carbon, so the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Because propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the first carbon, then the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3? No, that would make the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbonyl is on the third carbon, the middle is CH2, and the end is CH2(OH). No, wait, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO–. So in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl group is on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2COOCH3, but wait, where's the hydroxyl? Oh, wait. The correct structure is:

The propanoate is:

COOCH3 is the first carbon. The second carbon is CH(OH), and the third is CH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no—that's three carbons. So COOCH3 is the first, then the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is attached to an oxygen (the ester), and then the next carbon is CH(OH), and then another CH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. That would make the hydroxyl on the second carbon (the middle one). So the molecule is:

COOCH3 is connected to CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. The formula would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So each CH2 group is connected in a chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The important point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group is the alpha carbon (the one next to the carbonyl). Let's see: the carbonyl is C=O, connected to the ester oxygen. The next carbon is CH(OH), and then another CH3 or CH2 group.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate has three carbons: COOCH3 is the first, then the second is CH(OH), and the third is CH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the carbon attached to the hydroxyl is the second carbon. Let's see what's attached to that carbon. It's connected to:

- The carbonyl carbon (COOCH3)
- A hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Two methyl groups? No, wait, the structure would be:

COOCH3 is connected to CH(OH) which is connected to CH3. So the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

1. COOCH3 (the first carbon)
2. OH
3. CH3 (the third carbon)
4. And another hydrogen? Because each carbon forms four bonds. So the second carbon has four substituents: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H.

Wait, no, wait. The second carbon is CH(OH), which is connected to COOCH3, CH3, OH, and a hydrogen. So it's CH(OH) connected to COOCH3 (on one side), CH3 (on the other), and OH and H. So four different groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, H. So that carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is the benzene ring. The structure is a ketone with two benzene rings attached to the carbonyl group. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two benzene rings. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Wait, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two oxygen atoms (one double bond, one single bond, but wait, the carbonyl is C=O, so the carbonyl carbon is only connected to O via a double bond. So the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and a double bond O. Wait, no, the carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbon is double-bonded to O, and has two phenyl groups attached. So the substituents are: two phenyl groups, an O (double bond), and what else? Wait, the carbonyl carbon only has three substituents: two phenyl and one O. Oh wait, no, in benzophenone, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double bond O. No, wait, each carbon can only have four bonds. So the carbonyl is a double bond to O, and the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a single bond to another O (as in O). No, wait, no. The structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the carbonyl group is C=O, and the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a double bond O. Wait, but that's only three bonds. So I must be missing something. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, and has two single bonds to the phenyl groups. So the four bonds are: two to phenyl, one double to O, and no, that's only three. Wait, no—wait, perhaps it's better to think that the carbonyl group is O=C–, so the C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

In that case, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a double bond O. So that's only three substituents. But carbon needs four bonds. So where is that? Oh wait, the carbonyl group is O=C-Ph-Ph.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. No, benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO, so the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a double bond O, and what else? There's no other substituent. Wait, that's only three bonds. So I must be misunderstanding. Perhaps the structure is Ph–CO–Ph, where the CO is a ketone. So the carbonyl is a double bond O and two single bonds to phenyl groups. So the central carbon is C=O with two phenyls. But that would only be three bonds. So perhaps the structure is Ph–C(O)–Ph, where the C is connected to two phenyl groups and has a double bond O and a single bond O. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, which is Ph–C(O)–Ph. So the carbonyl is O=C–, so the C is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to Ph groups. So that's three substituents. But carbon needs four bonds. So that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's (Ph)2CO where the central C is connected to two phenyl groups and the O is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–C–(O)–Ph, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is a ketone, so the C is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to the phenyl groups. So the central C has two Ph groups, a double bond O, and a lone pair? No, that can't be. Oh, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me move on and come back.

Alternatively, perhaps benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers because all the substituents are symmetrical. The molecule is symmetrical because both substituents on the carbonyl are identical (phenyl groups). So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, with both acid groups esterified with methanol. The structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. Wait, no—fumarate is the (E) isomer of the two carboxylic acid groups on a double bond. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Or more accurately, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3 connected to C=C, and the other O-CO-OCH3 is on the other C of the double bond.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is:

COOCH3–CH2–CH2–COOCH3? No, that's not right. Fumarate is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that's incorrect. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. So the structure is:

COOCH3—CH2—CH2—COOCH3, but wait, no—fumarate is the (E) isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||           O
O-CO-OCH3   O-CO-OCH3
    \       /
     C=C
    /       \
   CH3      CH3

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, no, wait—no, that's succinic acid. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the diacid has a double bond between the two middle carbons. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, both -OH groups are replaced by OCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3? No, wait, more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2 (but with double bond)
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

The double bond is between the two middle carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2 (double bond)
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

Wait, but that's not possible because the double bond can't have two substituents on each end. Let me correct that. The correct structure is:

The two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, so the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

But that's not correct because that would imply a single bond. Wait, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of the diacid. So the structure is:

The two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But this would only be possible if the substituents on each C of the double bond are the same. Wait, no, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Let me think in terms of the double bond. The structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the (E) isomer, so the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct because that would imply a single bond. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed by considering whether it has a chiral center or not.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with ester groups on each end. The double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Which would be the (E) isomer. In this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it not chiral. Wait, but in that case, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (each has a COOCH3 group), so the molecule would be symmetrical. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on each side of the double bond are identical. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it can't have optical isomerism. So compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. Dimethyl fumarate is the diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Fumarate is the trans (E) isomer, and maleate is the cis (Z) isomer. But neither of them has a chiral center because the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same. So both are achiral, and thus do not show optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Wait, wait—no, because each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So there's no chiral center. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I might be making a mistake here. Let me think again. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, wait, no. Because fumarate is (E), so each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me look up fumarate structure mentally. Fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, it becomes (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each of the two carboxylic acid groups becomes an ester. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 on both ends of the double bond.

So, the structure is (OCH2COOCH3)–CH2–CH2–(OCH2COOCH3). No, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (Z) and (E) isomers. Fumarate is the (E) isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But that would imply the same groups on both ends, which would make the molecule symmetrical, hence achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Let me think about another possibility. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but each is attached to a carbon that's part of the double bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical in such a way that it doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on this. Let me consider another approach. Do any of the compounds have a chiral center?

1. Earlier thought: no chiral center because of symmetry.

2. Yes, chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So the compounds that show optical isomerism are numbers 2 and 4? No, wait, earlier analysis said 4 doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 4 doesn't have a chiral center because the substituents on each double bond are the same, leading to symmetry.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting confused. Let me think about the actual structure of dimethyl fumarate again. It's the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, each -OH becomes -OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

Wait, but that's incorrect. The correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but with the groups on opposite sides (E configuration). So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group (from the double bond).

Wait, no, the structure is:

The molecule is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But that would imply that each C in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. Alternatively, the structure is where each C in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps I should recall that dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, but without a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: an example of a molecule with a double bond but no chiral center. Maleic anhydride is another example. It has a double bond but isn't chiral. So dimethyl fumarate is similar. So, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, only number 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that number 1 might not have a chiral center because of symmetry, but maybe I was wrong. Let me re-examine compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The question is whether any carbon in the molecule has four different substituents.

Looking at the biphenyl structure, the connecting carbon (the one at position 1 and 1') is connected to two benzene rings, so it's a single point; but that's not a carbon in the rings—it's the point where the rings are connected. So the carbons in the rings are at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, the ester groups are attached at position 2 of each ring. So the carbon at position 2 on each ring is attached to the ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and also connected to the benzene ring. So, what are the substituents on that carbon?

Each of these carbons is part of the benzene ring, so it's a sp2 hybridized carbon. Sp2 carbons can't be chiral centers because they have only three substituents (the two adjacent ring carbons and the ester group). So, they can't have four different groups attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring, making it a substituent. But since the carbon is part of the ring, it's sp2 hybridized and can't have four substituents.

So, in this case, no chiral center exists in the molecule, so compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, among the four compounds, only number 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But none of the options say that. Looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is A and D.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. So the options don't have an option that says only 2. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me go back.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate.

The structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that can't be right. Let me think of it as:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

But that would mean that each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group. So each of those carbons would have:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two other substituents from the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure is more accurately:

Each double-bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group, but that's not correct. Let me think again.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH3O)2C–CH=CH–C(O)OCH3? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the structure is:

The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of the structure as:

The molecule is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

But that's not correct because that would be a single bond. Wait, perhaps it's:

Each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, no. The correct structure is:

Each of the double-bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But that can't be because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and two other groups. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (E)-CH2-COOCH3–C=CH–COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that's not possible. I'm getting stuck again. Let me try a different approach.

Dimethyl fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid has a double bond between the second and third carbons, with carboxylic acid groups on the first and fourth carbons. When esterified, those acid groups become esters.

So the structure is:

COOCH3–CH2–CH2–COOCH3

But that's a single bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH. Esterifying with methanol gives (CH3O)2C–CH=CH–C(O)OCH3? No, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

But that's a single bond. I'm clearly getting this wrong. Let me think of the actual structure. Dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond, with ester groups on each end. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C

COOCH3

But that would require each carbon in the double bond to have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. Alternatively, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group, but that would require four substituents per carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So:

CH2–C(COOCH3)=C(COOCH3)–CH2

But that can't be right. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that would mean each double-bond carbon has a CH2 group and two COOCH3 groups. No, that's impossible. Each carbon can only have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Each double-bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)–CH2–COOCH3.

No, that's not correct either. I'm clearly not getting the structure right, so perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck and think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have a chiral center. If it's not symmetrical, it might.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the (E) isomer. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does that make the molecule symmetrical? Yes, because the substituents on each carbon are the same (each has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group), making the molecule symmetrical across the double bond. Therefore, it can't have a chiral center and thus no optical isomerism.

So, back to the original analysis: only compound 2 has a chiral center, so only that one exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Let me check the options again:

Options:
A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Wait, if I'm right and only 2 has optical isomerism, then none of the options fit. But that can't be right because the options must include the correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: maybe compound 4 has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the ester groups are attached in such a way that another carbon has four different substituents. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6. The 2 position is adjacent to the 1 position (where the rings are connected). So, the carbon at position 2 on each ring is attached to the ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and is part of the benzene ring.

Since that carbon is part of the ring, it's sp2 hybridized, meaning it has three substituents: the two adjacent ring carbons and the ester group. So, it's not a chiral center.

But wait, what about the connecting carbon (the one at position 1 and 1')? It's connected to two benzene rings, but that's a single point. The actual carbons are in the rings.

So, no chiral centers in compound 1. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only one that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). Since 4 doesn't have a chiral center, maybe I was wrong about 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, let's imagine the structure of dimethyl fumarate as:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that's a single bond, which can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2–CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central double bond with ester groups on each end. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Now, each of the double-bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. But that would imply each carbon has two identical substituents, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, no chiral centers.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center at the ester groups. No, the ester carbons are connected to OCH3, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon in the chain. For example, the carbonyl carbon in the ester is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the central double bond is flanked by two ester groups, but those groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical and thus achiral.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Given the options, and the analysis that only 2 is correct, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I missed that compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think: perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the ester groups are attached in such a way that another carbon has four different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, and its diester (dimethyl fumarate) is a diastereomer of maleate diester. But neither has a chiral center because the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, making the molecule symmetrical.

So, back to the initial conclusion: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2 and 4. But why would 1 and 4 show optical isomerism?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let's reevaluate.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Is there a chiral center in this structure? The only possibility is the central connecting point. But that's a single point, not a carbon. The carbons are in the rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two rings are mirror images across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

In this compound, each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, considering the positions, the molecule could be symmetrical. For instance, if the ester groups are on the same side relative to the connecting bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

So, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center.

In that case, only compound 2 has a chiral center. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again. Another possibility: dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, with that, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only one that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4), D (1 and 2), and option A includes 4, which I thought doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center because the substituents on the double bond are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

Each of the double-bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group, but arranged in a way that creates asymmetry.

Wait, perhaps each double-bond carbon has a COOCH3, a CH2, and two more substituents. No, that's not possible. I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central carbon with four different substituents. But I can't see how that would happen in dimethyl fumarate.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2 and 4. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. For example, maybe compound 4 has a plane of symmetry and thus no optical isomerism.

In that case, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4. So which compounds show optical isomerism?

Wait, perhaps compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism. How?

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a central carbon that's a chiral center. But I don't see that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the two ester groups are on the same side, creating a chiral center. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4. So I'll have to say that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, which is necessary for a compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The carbons at position 2 on each ring are part of the benzene ring (sp² hybridized) and have three substituents: the benzene ring, the ester group, and a hydrogen. Since these carbons are sp² hybridized, they cannot be chiral centers. The molecule as a whole is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on both rings, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (the second carbon in the chain) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH₃), and the ester group (COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Since the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, it cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂ in the (E)-configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups: a methyl ester group (COOCH₃) and a hydrogen atom. Since the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical, the molecule is symmetrical and does not have a chiral center. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (compound 2) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. None of the other compounds have chiral centers and thus do not exhibit optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options match this conclusion exactly. Based on the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, though compound 1 and 4 were determined not to exhibit optical isomerism.

Answer: A
