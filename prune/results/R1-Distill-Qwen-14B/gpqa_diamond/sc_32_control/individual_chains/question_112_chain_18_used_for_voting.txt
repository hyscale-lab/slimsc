Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, alright, the state is described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator's matrix elements are given, right? Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Oh wait, so what does that matrix look like? Let me think. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because there are two states, up and down), the matrix would have zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. So it's [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Oh wait, wait, no, Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j? So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but what operator has this matrix representation? Oh, I think that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the given matrix is (hbar/2) times X. Right.

So the eigenstates of this operator (let's call it A) are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. What are those? I remember that the eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). 

Wait, but no, maybe I should double-check. The eigenstates of X are indeed (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), but in our case, |up> is like |0> and |down> is |1>, so yeah, that's correct.

So the problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates (|+x> and |-x>), and then the average value of operator A.

But wait, the initial state is |alpha>, which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Oh, and we need to normalize it first, right? Because it's proportional, but not necessarily normalized.

Let me write down |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

Wait, but to find probabilities, I need the state to be normalized. So first, compute the norm of this vector.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 -i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of operator A (the given matrix) are |+x> and |-x>.

I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can compute the probability amplitudes by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Let me write the eigenstates:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, the amplitude for |+x> is < +x | alpha >.

Let me compute that inner product.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So, compute this:

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ <up|up> (1+i) + <up|down> (2 -i) + <down|up> (1+i) + <down|down> (2 -i) ]

But the inner products <up|down> and <down|up> are zero because they are orthonormal.

So it simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Wait, wait no, wait. Let me write it correctly.

The terms are:

<up|up> is 1, multiplied by (1+i) from |alpha>, so (1+i)
<up|down> is 0, so the second term is 0
<down|up> is 0, so the third term is 0
<down|down> is 1, multiplied by (2 -i)

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2*7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Combine terms:

(1+i +2 -i) = 3. So the amplitude is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, because 2*7 is 14, right? Hmm, wait:

Wait, sqrt(2 *7) = sqrt(14). So yes.

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. So that's the probability of getting |+x>.

Then the probability for |-x> would be | < -x | alpha > |^2.

Compute < -x | alpha >:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Because:

<up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)
<down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
Multiply by the coefficients in the inner product: 1 for <up| and -1 for <down|.

So the amplitude is (1+i - (2 -i)) / sqrt(14).

Simplify numerator: (1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i)

So amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) for |+x> and 5/14 (~0.36) for |-x>.

Wait, wait, 9/14 is about 0.6428, yes, and 5/14 is about 0.3571, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So looking at the options, which one has these probabilities?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Option B) 0.54, 0.46 ... no.

Option C) 0.28, 0.72... no.

Option D) 0.61, 0.29... no.

So A's probabilities match. But what about the average value?

The average value of operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues + hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14 respectively.

Wait, because when you measure A, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which are (for the given matrix) the eigenvalues of the operator.

Wait, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So A = (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is (hbar/2) σ_x.

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), i.e., ±hbar/2.

So the average value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So average value = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) 

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ] (hbar/2 )

= (4/14) * (hbar/2 )

= (2/7) * (hbar/2 )

= (2 * hbar )/(14) ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at option A, yes, average is hbar/7. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the average. Another approach would be to compute <A> directly.

Another way to compute <A> is to write |alpha> in the z-basis, compute A|alpha>, then take the inner product.

But perhaps that's more work. Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and |alpha> is a state in the z-basis, perhaps the expectation value <A> = (hbar/2) <sigma_x>.

Sigma_x is the Pauli X operator. The expectation value of sigma_x is given by <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Which is equal to 2 * Re( <up|sigma_x|alpha> ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can compute it using the components.

Alternatively, since sigma_x has matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], then <sigma_x> is:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (a*, b*) ] [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [a; b] 

Wait, wait, |alpha> is a column vector [a; b], where a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2-i)/sqrt(7).

So a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

So sigma_x applied to |alpha> would be [ b; a ]

Then the inner product <alpha | sigma_x | alpha> is a* b + b* a.

Wait, no, because the inner product is [ a*   b* ] [ 0  1; 1 0 ] [ a; b ] = a* b + b* a.

So compute a* b + b* a.

Compute a* b:

a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)
a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i²
i squared is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7

Similarly, b* a is (2 +i)(1 +i)/7

(2)(1) + (2)(i) +i(1) +i(i) = 2 +2i +i +i²

i squared is -1. So 2 +3i -1 =1+3i.

So b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

So a* b + b* a = (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7. Which matches what I found earlier.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is hbar/7. So option A is correct.

The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of a given operator \( A \), as well as calculating the average value of \( A \). The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are orthonormal eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation with zeros on the diagonal and \( \hbar/2 \) on the off-diagonal, corresponding to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \) matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The norm of \( |\alpha\rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring \( |\pm x\rangle \)
The probabilities are determined by projecting \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):
\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2, \quad P(-x) = |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2.
\]
Compute \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| + \langle \downarrow| \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]
Similarly, compute \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| - \langle \downarrow| \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]
Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha| \sigma_x |\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \), compute:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |\pm x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
