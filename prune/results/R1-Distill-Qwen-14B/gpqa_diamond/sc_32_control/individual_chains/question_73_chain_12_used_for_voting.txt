Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, it's about relativistic speeds and energy. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, the question has two parts: relative speed and total energy. Let me think about each part step by step.

First, the relative speed. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. So when you have two objects moving at speeds v1 and v2 in the same direction, their relative speed isn't simply v1 - v2. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, wait. Actually, I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, I'm not sure if it's v1 minus v2 or the other way around. Since they're moving in the positive x-direction, the astronaut with higher speed is ahead, right? So the relative speed would be the difference. Wait, no, the relative speed is how fast one is moving from the other's frame. So if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

So, let me note down the velocities. Let me denote astronaut A as the one with mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B as the one with mass 3m moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Using the formula: v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction. Let me think. Suppose in the lab frame, object 1 is moving at u1, object 2 at u2. Then, from object 1's frame, the speed of object 2 is (u2 - u1)/(1 - (u1 u2)/(c²)).

So in this case, u1 is 0.6c, u2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is (-0.1c). The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (-0.1c) / 0.7 → which is approximately -0.1428c. But speed is a positive quantity, so the magnitude is about 0.1428c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D both have 0.14c. So that's part of the answer.

Wait, but wait. The direction? Since u2 is less than u1, the relative speed is negative, meaning B is moving slower than A from A's frame. But when we talk about relative speed, we usually take the magnitude, so 0.14c.

So the relative speed is 0.14c. That narrows it down to options C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. Each contributes gamma*m*c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Energy_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, is the total energy calculated as the sum of their energies in the center of momentum frame? No, the question says the 'total energy of the system', which in relativity usually refers to the sum of their energies in the same frame, unless specified otherwise. So I think adding their energies in the lab frame is correct. Or wait, is there another way?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, 'the total energy of the system'. In relativity, the total energy would be the sum of the energies in the center of momentum frame, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps they're considering the sum from the lab frame. Let me think about the frame.

Assuming the lab frame is the rest frame where both are moving. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut in that frame.

So yes, that's what I did. So 2.5 + 3.464 is about 5.964 mc², which rounds to 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says E=5 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculation. Let me recompute the gammas.

For A: v=0.6c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Energy of A: 2m * gamma * c² = 2 *1.25 m c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

For B: v=0.5c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) → sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

Energy of B: 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3 * 1.1547 m c² = 3.464 m c².

Total energy: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

So option C is E=5.96 mc², which is correct.

So the options have:

C) v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc^2

Which matches our results.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\). Thus, the relative speed is \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\) is unphysical, and \(E = mc^2\) is too low.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\) is incorrect, though \(E = 4.96m c^2\) is close.
- **Option C**: Correct, as \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and \(E = 5.96m c^2\) match the calculations.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) is correct, but \(E = 5m c^2\) is too low.
