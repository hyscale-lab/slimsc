Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, and D, each listing different fermions.

First, I remember that the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions. For a decay to be possible, the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion, because each fermion would carry away some energy, and you need enough to create both particles and their antiparticles.

So, the Lagrangian is given, but I don't think I need to look too much into that. The interaction term is between X and some fermions, but the problem probably just wants me to know which fermions are possible decay products based on mass limits.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's list the fermion masses. I should probably remember the approximate masses of the known fermions.

The known fermions (quarks and leptons) have the following masses (in GeV/c², but I can approximate without worrying about the c² since we're comparing masses):

- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (so about 3 MeV)
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV (a bit more than u)
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV (about 95 MeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e-): ~0.0005 GeV (0.5 MeV)
- Muon (μ-): ~0.105 GeV (105 MeV)
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible, almost massless.

Wait, but wait—tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2 * tau mass is about 3.56 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, that's more than enough. So tau can be a decay product.

But wait, the top quark is 173 GeV, which is way bigger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 6 GeV is much less than 2*173 GeV. So any decay involving top quarks is impossible, so any option with t tbar is out. So looking at the options:

Option C includes t tbar. So C is not possible. So we can eliminate option C.

So now, the possible decay products are fermions with mass less than 3 GeV each.

Wait, wait, wait. X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV because the maximum each can take is half the mass (if the other particle is negligible). But in reality, since both particles have mass, the limit is a bit stricter, but for the purpose of this question, I think we can just say that each fermion must be less than half the X mass.

So 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV. So fermion mass must be less than 3 GeV. Let's see which fermions fit.

Looking at the quarks:

u: ~0.003 GeV → yes.
d: ~0.004 GeV → yes.
s: ~0.095 GeV → yes.
c: ~1.5 GeV → yes (since 1.5 <3)
b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → no. So X can't decay into b quarks.

So possible quarks: u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait—c is 1.5 GeV, so 2*c is 3 GeV. So X can just about decay into c cbar, since 6 GeV is exactly twice 3 GeV. So the threshold is met. So c cbar is allowed.

What about the leptons?

e: 0.0005 GeV → yes.
mu: 0.105 GeV → yes.
tau: 1.78 GeV → 2*tau is ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, tau can be a decay product.

But wait, 6 GeV is more than 3.56 GeV, so tau is allowed.

But wait, another thing: the X boson's decay must produce a pair of particles (fermion and anti-fermion), so the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to the X mass.

So for tau, each is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is 3.56, which is less than 6. So yes, allowed.

Now, what about the bottom quark? Each is 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 = 9 GeV, which is way more than 6. So X can't decay into b quarks. So any option that includes b quarks is out.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. Since X is 6 GeV, which is more than 2*b (4.5*2=9 GeV), so b can't be a decay product. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct because c is 1.5 GeV, which is allowed. So X can decay into c cbar, s sbar, etc. So option B is a candidate.

Option D: Includes b, so that's out.

So the correct options are B and D? Wait, no. Because in the options, option D includes b, which is not allowed. So only option B doesn't include b and c is included.

Wait, let me recheck the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

But wait, tau is allowed. But in option A, it includes b, which is not allowed because 2*m(b) is 9 GeV, which is higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

All these fermions have masses less than 3 GeV. So that's allowed.

Option C includes t tbar, which is impossible, so C is out.

Option D includes b, so it's also wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait another thought: the interaction term in the Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the interaction term is something like a Yukawa coupling. The term seems like it's for a Yukawa interaction where the scalar field X is coupled to fermions. The fermion masses are given by v, which is the vacuum expectation value.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The interaction term is given, but for the purpose of this question, it's probably just about which fermions are allowed kinematically. So I think the Lagrangian just tells us that X can decay into any of the fermions it's coupled to. But in any case, the problem is about which decay channels are allowed based on mass.

So given that, the allowed decay products are any fermions with mass less than 3 GeV, considering that X is 6 GeV. So the possible fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So in the options, option B includes all of these except for the b and t quarks.

Wait, but wait, the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair decay is allowed.

So the possible decay channels are for fermions with mass less than 3 GeV.

So the allowed decays are: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So looking back at the options:

Option B lists exactly these: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So option B is correct.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so it's incorrect.

So the answer should be option B.

The decay of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV depends on the masses of the fermions it can decay into. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (or pair of fermions). The fermion masses are approximately:

- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau lepton (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)

The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV, so the maximum mass for a fermion pair is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (half of 6 GeV). This allows the following fermions to be decay products:

- \( u, d, s, c \) quarks (all have masses less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( \tau, \mu, e \) leptons (all have masses less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

The bottom quark (\( b \)) has a mass of \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m(b) = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds the mass of \( X \). Therefore, \( X \) cannot decay into \( b\bar{b} \). Similarly, the top quark (\( t \)) is far too heavy (\( m(t) \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) and cannot be a decay product.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**.
