Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me try to think through how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, first, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

The speed v is given as 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. Instead, we have to consider the relativistic energy formula.

Wait, the formula for relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m c². Or is it the total energy that's gamma * m c²? Oh right, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (mc²). So E = gamma * mc². And the kinetic energy would be E - mc², which is (gamma - 1) mc².

But the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC, which I think refers to the total energy, so we'll probably use E = gamma * mc².

So I need to compute gamma here. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me compute that. Since v is 0.96c, v² is (0.96)^2 c². So (v²/c²) is 0.9216. Subtract that from 1: 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Take the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/sqrt(0.0784) is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 can be calculated. Let's see, what's 0.28 squared? 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. Oh, perfect, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now I need to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus X. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the atomic mass unit (u) and convert it to energy. But I'm not sure off the top of my head of the exact mass of Li-6. Maybe I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the mass is approximately the same as the sum of the individual nucleons. Let me think. A proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, we have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939) = Let's compute that.

3 * 938 = 2814, 3 * 939 = 2817. Sum is 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, but that's the mass in MeV/c². But wait, for a nucleus, sometimes there's a mass defect due to binding energy, but I think in this case, unless given the exact mass, we can approximate using the sum of the individual nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem just gives the atomic mass as 6 u, which is about 6 * 931 MeV/c² (since 1 u is about 931 MeV/c²). Let me confirm: 1 atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV/c².

Wait, but the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 u because of the binding energy. Let me check, but maybe the problem expects us to use the approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number in terms of the nucleus and the rest mass energy as A * u * c².

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by using the relativistic energy formula with the rest mass energy as m c², where m is the rest mass of the nucleus.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The nucleus X is Li-6. The molar mass of Li is about 7 g/mol (since Li has an atomic weight of approximately 7), but wait, Li-6 is an isotope, so maybe the exact mass isn't critical here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, but that might not be accurate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass of Li-6 in terms of u. Let me look it up mentally. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u. (I remember that Li-7 is about 7.016 u, so Li-6 is a bit less than 6.016 u. Let's say 6.015 u.)

So, the mass m of Li-6 is 6.015 u. 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so m c² is 6.015 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, but let's calculate that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589. Then 0.015 * 931.5 = approximately 13.9725. So total m c² is 5589 + 13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5602.9725 MeV = 5.6029725 GeV ≈5.603 GeV.

So, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Another approach is to use the molar mass. Li has an atomic weight of about 7, but Li-6 is about 6.941 u? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to just calculate with A * u, where A is 6, and u is 931 MeV/c².

So A =6, so mass is 6 * 931.5 MeV/c² = 5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Hmm, but perhaps the exact mass isn't required because the problem expects us to use the given options, and perhaps the calculation would proceed with that approximation.

So, moving forward, E = gamma * m c².

We have gamma ≈3.5714, m c² = 5.589 GeV (if we approximate it as 6u), or 5.603 GeV (if using 6.015 u). Let's proceed with 5.603 GeV as m c².

So E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5 =17.857 GeV.

3.5714 *0.603 = Let's compute that.

0.6 *3.5714 ≈ 2.1428

0.003 *3.5714 ≈0.0107

So total 2.1428 + 0.0107=2.1535

So 3.5714 *5.603 = 17.857 + 2.1535 ≈20.0105 GeV.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, 3.5714 *5.603:

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857

3.5714 *0.603 = ?

Compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 *0.003=0.0107142

So sum is 2.14284 +0.0107142 =2.1535542.

Total E ≈17.857 +2.1535542 =20.0105542 GeV.

So approximately 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

So my calculation gives around 20.01 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Now, the rest energy m c².

If I take m as 6 u, then m c²=6 * 931.5 MeV=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.589 = ?

Compute 3.5714 *0.5=1.7857.

3.5714 *0.089 = approximately 0.3180.

So sum is 1.7857 +0.3180=2.1037.

So total E=17.857 + 2.1037 =19.9607 GeV.

Approximately 19.96 GeV, which is about 19.96. So looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value is higher. Maybe because I used m=6 u, but actual m is a bit higher, like 6.015 u.

So let's do that.

m c²=6.015 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.015 *931.5=13.9725 MeV.

Total m c²=5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.5714 *5.6029725.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6029725.

Wait, 0.6029725 is about 0.6 +0.0029725.

3.5714 *0.6=2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0029725= approximately 0.0106.

So sum is 2.14284 +0.0106=2.15344.

So total E=17.857 +2.15344=20.01044 GeV.

So about 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than our calculation. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the gamma calculation?

Wait, let me double-check gamma. 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857... correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that I considered m as 6.015 u, but perhaps the actual mass is higher, leading to a higher energy.

Wait, let me think about the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015123 u. So let's use that.

So m c²=6.015123 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

So 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.015123 u *931.5 MeV/u = 0.015123 *931.5.

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005123 *931.5= approx 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, plus 0.000123*931.5≈0.1142. So total 4.6575+0.1142=4.7717.

So sum is 9.315 +4.7717=14.0867 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +14.0867=5603.0867 MeV=5.6030867 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6030867.

Let me compute that accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6030867.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0030867.

0.003 *3.57142857=0.0107142857.

0.0000867 *3.57142857≈0.0003103.

So sum is 0.0107142857 +0.0003103≈0.0110245857.

So 3.57142857 *0.6030867≈2.14285714 +0.0110245857≈2.15388172.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.15388172≈19.95102457 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.951 GeV. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6030867 more accurately.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 3.57142857 *5.6030867.

Let me write it as:

3.57142857 * 5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6030867.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6030867.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0030867.

0.0030867 is approximately 0.003 +0.0000867.

3.57142857 *0.003 =0.0107142857.

3.57142857 *0.0000867.

Compute 3 *0.0000867=0.0002601.

0.57142857 *0.0000867≈0.00004953.

Wait, 0.57142857 *0.0000867 = ?

Well, 0.5 *0.0000867=0.00004335.

0.07142857 *0.0000867≈0.00000619.

So sum is approximately 0.00004335 +0.00000619=0.00004954.

So total for 0.0000867 is about 0.0002601 +0.00004954≈0.00030964.

So 3.57142857 *0.0030867≈0.0107142857 +0.00030964≈0.0110239257.

So 3.57142857 *0.6030867 ≈2.142857142 +0.0110239257≈2.153881068.

So total E = 17.85714285 +2.153881068 =19.95102391 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 19.951 GeV. So none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is about 0.18 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the mass. Let me check the actual mass of Li-6.

Looking up in my memory, I think Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.015134 u. So that's correct.

So m c²=6.015134 *931.5 MeV.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.015134 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005134 *931.5 = let's compute:

931.5 *0.005 =4.6575.

931.5 *0.000134= approx 931.5 *0.0001=0.09315, so 0.000134 is 0.09315 *1.34≈0.1248.

So 4.6575 +0.1248=4.7823.

So 0.005134 *931.5≈4.7823.

So total is 9.315 +4.7823=14.0973 MeV.

So m c²=5589 +14.0973=5603.0973 MeV=5.6030973 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6030973 GeV.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.6030973.

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6030973.

I can think of this as 3.57142857 * (5 +0.6030973) =3.57142857 *5 +3.57142857 *0.6030973.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6030973.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0030973.

Compute 0.003 *3.57142857=0.0107142857.

0.0000973 *3.57142857 ≈approx 3.57142857 *9.73e-5.

3.57142857 *9.73e-5 ≈0.0003475.

So sum is 0.0107142857 +0.0003475≈0.0110617857.

So 3.57142857 *0.6030973=2.142857142 +0.0110617857≈2.153918928.

So E=17.85714285 +2.153918928≈20.0110618 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6030973 more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.6030973 as:

3.57142857 ×5.6030973.

I'll use a calculator approach.

5 ×3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6030973 ×3.57142857:

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.0030973 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.003 =0.0107142857.

3.57142857 ×0.0000973= let's compute this.

0.0000973 is 9.73e-5.

3.57142857 ×9.73e-5 = approx 3.57142857 *0.0000973.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 0.0000973:

3.57142857 * 0.00009 =0.0003214285713.

3.57142857 *0.0000073= approx 0.000026009765.

Sum is approximately 0.0003214285713 +0.000026009765 =0.000347438336.

So sum for 0.0030973 is 0.0107142857 +0.000347438336 ≈0.011061724.

So 0.6030973 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142 +0.011061724=2.153918866.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153918866=20.0110617 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.011 GeV.

So the options are:

C) 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher. So maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the mass is 6 u, so m c²=5.589 GeV.

Let's compute it with m c²=5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.589.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.5=1.785714285.

3.57142857 ×0.089= approximately 0.3180.

So sum is 1.785714285 +0.3180=2.103714285.

So E=17.85714285 +2.103714285=19.96085714 GeV.

So E≈19.96 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in another area. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, the problem says the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy would be the total energy, which is gamma m c².

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is per nucleon? No, I don't think so. RHIC's energy is per ion.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon, not the entire nucleus. Wait, but the nucleus is Li-6, which has 6 nucleons. So perhaps I should have used the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by 6, but perhaps the problem expects the use of the atomic mass, including electrons.

Wait, no. In particle physics, when considering heavy ions, the mass used is the rest mass of the entire nucleus, not per nucleon. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula but with the rest mass of the entire nucleus. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using beta=0.96, so gamma is higher.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute (1 - (0.96)^2 )=1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Yes, so gamma is 3.57142857.

So I can't find a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me check that. If the question is about the kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c².

In that case, E = (gamma -1) m c².

So, with gamma=3.57142857, gamma-1=2.57142857.

If m c²=5.603 GeV, then E_kinetic=2.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

2.57142857 *5 =12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.603= let's compute:

2.57142857 *0.6=1.542857142.

2.57142857 *0.003=0.0077142857.

So sum is 1.542857142 +0.0077142857=1.550571428.

So E_kinetic=12.85714285 +1.550571428=14.40771428 GeV.

That's about 14.408 GeV, which isn't matching any of the options.

Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the total energy, the initial calculation was about 20 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic momentum formula, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has 6 nucleons. So if each nucleon has energy E, the total energy would be 6E.

But wait, the total energy is E_total = gamma * m_total c², where m_total is the sum of the masses of all nucleons. Hmm, that's the same as what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the kinetic energy per nucleon. But again, the question states the energy of the RHIC, which would be the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single proton or neutron, but that doesn't make sense for the nucleus.

Another thought: maybe the problem is considering only the kinetic energy per nucleon, but again, the question is about the nucleus's energy.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is correct and the options are approximated. So with the calculated E≈20.01 GeV, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check the exact value.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015123 u. So m c²=6.015123 *931.5 MeV.

6.015123 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.015123 *931.5= let's calculate.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005123 *931.5= ?

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.000123 *931.5=0.1142.

So 4.6575 +0.1142=4.7717.

So total m c²=5589 +9.315 +4.7717=5589 +14.0867=5603.0867 MeV=5.6030867 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6030867 GeV.

Let me compute this with higher precision.

3.57142857 *5.6030867.

We can break it down as:

5.6030867 =5 +0.6 +0.0030867.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0030867= let's compute.

0.0030867 *3.57142857.

= (0.003 +0.0000867) *3.57142857.

= 0.003 *3.57142857 +0.0000867 *3.57142857.

=0.0107142857 +0.000310397.

=0.0110246827.

So summing up:

17.85714285 (from 5)

+2.142857142 (from 0.6)

+0.0110246827 (from 0.0030867)

=17.85714285 +2.142857142 =19.999999992 +0.0110246827≈20.01102467 GeV.

So E≈20.011 GeV.

Looking back at the options, none exactly match this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the mass, or perhaps the problem expects a certain number of significant figures.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the mass is 6.015123 u, and compute the exact E.

E =3.57142857 *5.6030867 GeV.

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6030867.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030867.

(3 +0.57142857) * (5 +0.6 +0.0030867)

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 ×5.6030867.

Let me do it step by step.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0030867=0.0110246827.

Adding them together: 17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0 (exactly 20.0 because 17.85714285 +2.142857142 =19.999999992 ≈20.0).

Then add 0.0110246827: 20.0 +0.0110246827=20.0110246827 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, this is about 0.12 GeV higher than our calculation. Could there be a miscalculation? Or perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise terms.

Let me compute gamma with more precision.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2).

0.96^2=0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784 is exactly (0.28)^2, so sqrt is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the kinetic energy, but as I saw earlier, that would be around 14.4 GeV, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

The relativistic energy is E=gamma m c².

If X is the nucleus, which is Li-6, and the speed is 0.96c, then yes.

But perhaps the problem is referring to the ion's kinetic energy. So E_kinetic=(gamma -1) m c².

With gamma=3.57142857, E_kinetic=2.57142857 *5.6030867≈14.407 GeV.

But again, that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the total energy per nucleon. So each nucleon has (gamma * m_n c² ), where m_n is the mass of a neutron or proton.

Wait, but the nucleus is a combination of protons and neutrons. Let me think: the mass of the nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons, but each nucleon's energy would be gamma * m_i c², depending on whether it's a proton or neutron.

But this seems complicated, and the problem probably expects a simpler approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the speed of each nucleon as 0.96c, but that's not correct because the entire nucleus is moving at 0.96c, not individual nucleons.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is calculated using the average of protons and neutrons. Like, each nucleon contributes about 931.5 MeV/c², so 6 nucleons give 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

But that would make m c²=5.589 GeV, leading to E=3.57142857 *5.589≈20.0 GeV.

But again, none of the options exactly match.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher than our calculation. Maybe the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) more accurately.

Compute 1 -0.96^2 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly, so gamma=3.57142857.

No mistake there.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the deuteron or another nucleus. But I'm pretty sure Li-6 is the correct nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the lightest nucleus, like protons. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the entire ion, including electrons, but that would complicate things. For a nucleus, the mass includes electrons only if it's an atom, but in this case, it's a nucleus, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of Li-6 as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass) /2, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic number and neutron number to calculate the mass. Let me think.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron is about 939.5656 MeV/c².

So total mass would be 3*(938.272) +3*(939.5656) = compute that.

3 *938.272=2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.5656=2818.6968 MeV.

Sum is 2814.816 +2818.6968=5633.5128 MeV=5.6335128 GeV.

So m c²=5.6335128 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6335128.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6335128.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0335128= let's compute.

0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.0035128 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.012522.

So sum is 0.107142857 +0.012522≈0.119664857.

So 3.57142857 *0.6335128≈2.142857142 +0.119664857≈2.262521999.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.262521999≈20.11966485 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Ah, so perhaps that's the correct approach. The mass is computed as the sum of individual proton and neutron masses, leading to a higher m c², and thus a higher energy.

So with m c²=5.6335 GeV, E=3.57142857 *5.6335=20.1197 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV, matching option C:20.132 GeV.

But why would the problem expect us to use the sum of individual nucleon masses? Because the binding energy is usually negligible for such calculations, but perhaps in this case, the problem expects that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the actual exact mass of Li-6, which includes binding energy, leading to a lower m c², but I'm not sure.

But in this case, using the sum of nucleon masses, the energy comes closer to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass including electrons. For example, Li-6 as an atom would have 3 electrons, each with mass about 0.511 MeV/c². So adding 3 *0.511=1.533 MeV.

So m c²=5.6335128 GeV +0.001533 GeV=5.6350458 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.6350458.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6350458.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0350458= approx 0.12522.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.12522=2.268077.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.268077=20.12521985 GeV.

Which is about 20.1252 GeV.

Closer to option C:20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses plus the electrons, leading to about 20.125 GeV, which rounds to option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a Li-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate masses of a proton (\( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( 939.5656 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m c^2 = 3(938.272) + 3(939.5656) = 2814.816 + 2818.6968 = 5633.5128 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Substitute \( \gamma \) and \( m c^2 \) into the energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \approx 20.12 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
