Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. There are stability constants given for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. So, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The formula for the stability constant is β = [CoL_n]/([Co][L]^n), where L is the ligand here, which is SCN-.

Wait, so the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2+ for n=1,2,3,4. Each β corresponds to the formation of that complex. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^0, β3 for Co(SCN)_3^-2, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^-3? Not entirely sure about the charges, but maybe it's not critical for this calculation.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean n=2, so the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 maybe? I think the blue one is the one with two SCN ligands, so that's the second complex with β2=40.

So the goal is to find the fraction of Co in the form of Co(SCN)_2^(charge?), compared to all possible Co species.

I think I need to calculate the distribution of Co among the different complexes based on their stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

The approach might be to use the formation constants to determine the fraction of each complex. Since the problem gives the total cobalt concentration and the SCN- concentration, I can probably model the distribution.

Let me think about the general method. The distribution depends on the stability constants and the ligand concentration. The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula for each step, but considering all possible species.

Wait, another approach is to consider the stepwise formation of complexes. Each β is the formation constant for adding one more ligand. So, for example, β1 is for CoL → CoL^+ (if that's how it forms). Then β2 would be for CoL^+ + L → CoL2^2+ (or some other charge).

But wait, maybe I should think of the complexes in terms of their stepwise formation. The overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise constants. For example, the overall K for [CoL_2] is β1 * β2. Or wait, no. Each β is for the overall formation of that complex. Or perhaps each β is the stepwise constant for adding one ligand. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^0, etc. So each β is the overall stability constant for that particular complex.

So the four possible complexes are:

1. Co^2+ (n=0)
2. CoSCN^+ (n=1)
3. Co(SCN)_2^0 (n=2)
4. Co(SCN)_3^-2 (n=3)
5. Co(SCN)_4^-3 (n=4)

Wait, no. For Co^2+ and four SCN- ligands, each adding a negative charge, the complex would have a charge of 2 -4*(−1) = 2 +4 = +6? Wait, no. Wait, each SCN- is a ligand with charge -1. So Co^2+ plus n SCN- would have a charge of 2 - n*(−1) ? Wait, no. Wait, Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. When it binds, it's neutral or something. Hmm, maybe it's better not to get stuck on the charges and focus on the formation constants.

The problem is about the fraction of the Co in the dithiocyanato form, which is n=2. So what is the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution?

I think the way to approach this is using the concept of log K or the formation constants and the ligand concentration to determine the distribution of the complexes.

The approach is to calculate the conditional formation constant, which accounts for the ligand concentration. The distribution of each complex can be found by considering the relative stabilities and the ligand concentration.

Wait, another approach is the use of the distribution equation. The fraction of each complex can be determined by the ratio of their formation constants, adjusted by the ligand concentration.

I remember that the fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (β_0 [L]^0 + β_1 [L]^1 + β_2 [L]^2 + ... + β_n [L]^n )

But wait, β_0 is 1, because the complex [Co]^0 (n=0) has a stability constant of 1 (since [Co^2+]/([Co^2+][L]^0) =1). So the denominator becomes sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [L]^k.

Wait, but wait. The initial concentration is [Co^2+] = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all Co species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-2] + [Co(SCN)_4^-3] ] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So the problem is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2^0] over the total Co concentration.

So, to calculate this, we can model it using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction f of each complex is f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (sum_{k=0 to 4} β_k [L]^k )

Wait, but wait. Because the formation constants are given for each step, perhaps I should think in terms of the stepwise formation. Alternatively, perhaps each β represents the overall formation constant for that complex.

Hmm. So for each complex, the formation constant is β_n = [CoL_n]/([Co][L]^n).

So, the concentration of each complex is [CoL_n] = β_n [Co][L]^n.

But the total Co is the sum of all [CoL_n], so:

c(Co) = [Co] + [CoL] + [CoL2] + [CoL3] + [CoL4] 

Which can be written as:

c(Co) = [Co] ( 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4 )

So,

[Co] = c(Co) / (1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4 )

Then, the concentration of each complex [CoL_n] is β_n [L]^n [Co]

So, the fraction for each complex is [CoL_n]/c(Co) = (β_n [L]^n [Co]) / c(Co) 

Substituting [Co] from above, [Co] = c(Co) / denominator, where denominator = 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

So,

[CoL_n]/c(Co) = (β_n [L]^n [Co]) / c(Co) = (β_n [L]^n * c(Co) / denominator ) / c(Co) ) = β_n [L]^n / denominator.

So, the fraction for each complex is f_n = β_n [L]^n / denominator.

Ah, so the denominator is the sum of β_k [L]^k for k=0 to 4. Wait, because for k=0, β_0 is 1, and [L]^0 is 1. So denominator = 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

So, I can compute the denominator as 1 + β1*[SCN] + β2*[SCN]^2 + β3*[SCN]^3 + β4*[SCN]^4.

Given [SCN] is 0.1 M. Let's compute each term:

β1*[SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*[SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2 =40*0.01=0.4

β3*[SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

β4*[SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

So denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

Let me calculate that step by step.

1 + 0.9 is 1.9.

1.9 + 0.4 is 2.3.

2.3 + 0.063 is 2.363.

2.363 + 0.0016 is approximately 2.3646.

So denominator ≈2.3646.

Now, the fraction f_n for each complex is β_n*(SCN)^n / denominator.

So, for n=2 (the dithiocyanato complex), f_2 = β2*(SCN)^2 / denominator = 40*(0.1)^2 / 2.3646.

Compute numerator: 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So 0.169 is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Denominator:

beta1*[SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9.

beta2*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

beta3*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

beta4*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1 + 0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So f_2= 0.4 /2.3646 = approximately 0.169, or 16.9%. So option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm assuming that's the n=2 complex. So the calculation seems right.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me think again. Could there be a miscalculation in the denominator?

Wait, wait, no. Because for the denominator, each term is beta_k multiplied by [L]^k, summed from k=0 to 4. And for k=0, it's 1.

So, for n=2, the f_2 is (beta2 * [L]^2) / denominator.

I think that's correct.

So, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the ligand concentration to calculate the distribution of cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration is given as \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \). The goal is to find the fraction of the cobalt in the form of the dithiocyanato complex, \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 \), which corresponds to \( n = 2 \).

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\text{denominator}}
\]

where the denominator is:

\[
\text{denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
\]
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
\]
\[
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063
\]
\[
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
\]

\[
\text{denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

For \( n = 2 \), the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is:

\[
0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

The correct answer is:
