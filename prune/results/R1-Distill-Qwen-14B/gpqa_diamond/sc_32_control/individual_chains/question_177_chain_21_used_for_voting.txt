Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. From spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. 

The main point is that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, and we need to find that factor. They assume the stars radiate as black bodies, which probably means I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law here.

Wait, Stefan-Boltzmann law says that luminosity L is proportional to radius squared times temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πσR²T⁴, but since the constants are the same, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

So I need to find the ratio of their luminosities. But I don't have their temperatures directly. Hmm.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

So T1 = T2. Therefore, the temperatures are equal. So when I calculate L1/L2, the T terms will be (T1/T2)^4 = 1. So the luminosity ratio depends only on the radius squared. 

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 700 km/s. How does that factor in? Oh, perhaps it's related to the Doppler effect. Because when a star moves, it shifts the observed wavelength due to the Doppler shift. But in this case, the peak wavelength observed is the same for both stars. Wait, no, the problem states that they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. But that might not mean their intrinsic temperatures are the same. Because if one is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would shift.

Wait, but Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 is moving away or towards us at 700 km/s. But how does that affect their intrinsic temperatures?

Let me think. The observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving away, then v_r is positive, so the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). If Star_1 has v_r = 0, its observed wavelength is λ1 = λ1_intrinsic. Similarly, Star_2 has λ2_observed = λ1_observed (since the wavelengths are the same). So λ2_observed = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r2 / c) = λ1_observed = λ1_intrinsic.

But wait, since λ1_observed equals λ2_observed, and λ1_observed is λ1_intrinsic (because v_r1=0), and λ2_observed is λ2_intrinsic*(1 + v_r2/c) ), then:

λ1_intrinsic = λ2_intrinsic * (1 + v_r2/c)

We can rearrange this to find the ratio of their intrinsic emission peak wavelengths.

But from Wien's law, λ_max_intrinsic = b / T. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

Wait, but if the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, let's call that λ_obs. So for Star 1: λ_obs = λ1 = b/T1.

For Star 2: λ_obs = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

So set them equal:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

We can cancel the b's:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

Rearranging:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, but v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me check the units. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So v_r2 / c is 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

Since 700 is much smaller than 3e5, I can approximate 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x when x is small. So 1/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.997666.

So T1 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.997666.

Hmm, but wait, that's a small difference. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio T1 / T2 as 1 / (1 + v_r2/c). So T1 = T2 * [1/(1 + v_r2/c)].

But in any case, the point is that the temperatures are not exactly the same because Star_2 is moving. So the previous assumption that T1 = T2 is incorrect. So the initial approach where I thought the luminosity ratio is just (R1/R2)^2 is not correct either because T1 and T2 are different.

So I need to account for the Doppler shift in the temperature.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Both stars have same observed λ_max, which is λ_obs.

2. For Star 1: λ_obs = λ1 (since v_r1=0). So λ1 = b/T1.

3. For Star 2: λ_obs = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c)

And λ2_emit = b/T2.

So, from Star 2: λ_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Set equal to Star 1's λ_obs = b/T1.

So, b/T1 = (b/T2) (1 + v_r2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c)

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Alternatively, T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2/c) ]

Now, the velocities are v_r2 = 700 km/s, and c = 3e5 km/s.

v_r2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait, wait, 700 / 3e5 is 700 / 300000 = 0.002333333.

Ah, I see, I miscalculated earlier. So 700 / 3e5 is 700/300000 = 0.00233333.

So (1 + v_r2/c) = 1.00233333.

Thus,

T1 = T2 / 1.00233333 ≈ T2 * 0.99766667.

So T1 ≈ 0.99766667 * T2.

But perhaps I should be precise and not approximate. Let me write it as (1 + 700/3e5 ) is 1 + 7/3000 = 1 + 0.002333333.

So, the ratio of T1 to T2 is 1/(1.00233333) ≈ 0.997666.

Now, moving on to luminosity.

L = 4πσ R² T⁴.

So, the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And (T1/T2)^4 = (T1/(T2))^4.

But from earlier, T1 = T2 / (1.00233333). So T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1.00233333) ].

So, (T1/T2) = 1/(1.00233333) ≈ 0.99766667.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99766667)^4.

Let me compute that. Let me compute 0.99766667^4.

Wait, to compute (0.99766667)^4, perhaps it's easier to compute ln(x) and then exponentiate.

But perhaps a better way is to calculate it step by step:

x = 0.99766667

x squared: 0.99766667 * 0.99766667.

Let me compute that:

0.99766667 * 0.99766667.

Compute 1 - 0.00233333.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

So a=0.00233333.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 0.00466666 + (0.00233333)^2.

Which is approximately 0.99533334 + (0.0000054444) ≈ 0.99533878.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

Compute 0.99766667 * 0.99766667:

997666.67 * 997666.67 = ?

But perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.99766667^4 as (0.99766667^2)^2.

So first compute 0.99766667^2.

0.99766667 * 0.99766667.

Let me compute 1000000 * 1000000 = 1e12. But perhaps that's too big. Alternatively, 0.99 * 0.99 = 0.9801, but wait, our number is 0.99766667, which is 1 - 0.00233333.

Wait, perhaps I can use binomial expansion.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

a = 0.00233333.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 0.00466666 + (0.00233333)^2.

(0.00233333)^2 ≈ 5.44444e-6.

So 1 - 0.00466666 = 0.99533334, plus 0.0000054444 gives approx 0.99533878.

So (0.99766667)^2 ≈ 0.99533878.

Now, we need to square that to get to the 4th power.

So (0.99533878)^2 = ?

Again, using binomial expansion, (1 - b)^2 where b = 0.00466122.

Wait, 1 - 0.99533878 is 0.00466122.

So (1 - b)^2 = 1 - 2b + b².

So 2b = 0.00932244.

b² is (0.00466122)^2 ≈ 2.172e-5.

So 1 - 0.00932244 = 0.99067756, plus 2.172e-5 is 0.99069928.

So approximately 0.9907.

Wait, but let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it directly:

0.99533878 * 0.99533878.

Hmm.

Let me compute 99533878 × 99533878, but that's a big number, perhaps I'll approximate:

(0.99533878)² ≈ (0.995)^2 = 0.990025, but more accurately.

Alternatively, I'll think in terms of decimal places.

0.99533878 × 0.99533878.

Let me compute 0.99533878 × 0.99533878:

Let me compute it as (1 - 0.00466122) squared.

Wait, because 0.99533878 is 1 minus 0.00466122.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

a = 0.00466122.

2a = 0.00932244.

a² = (0.00466122)^2 = approx 0.000021727.

So 1 - 0.00932244 = 0.99067756.

Plus 0.000021727 gives 0.99069928.

So approximately 0.990699.

So (0.99766667)^4 ≈ 0.990699.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

Now, putting it all together.

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

What's 2.25 times 0.9907?

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

Wait, but 0.9907 is 0.99 + 0.0007, so 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275 and 2.25 * 0.0007 is 0.001575. So adding, it's 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

But wait, let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907 more accurately.

2.25 * 0.9907:

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814.

0.25 * 0.9907 = 0.247675.

Adding them: 1.9814 + 0.247675 = 2.229075.

Yes, same as before.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is approximately 2.23. So the closest option is D) ~2.23.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of (T1/T2)^4?

Because I assumed that T1 is T2 multiplied by 0.99766667, but perhaps I should compute (0.99766667)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 0.99766667^4 using more precise steps.

Compute 0.99766667^1 = 0.99766667

^2 = ?

0.99766667 * 0.99766667.

Let me compute this as:

(1 - 0.00233333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233333 + (0.00233333)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.00466666 + 0.0000054444.

So 1 - 0.00466666 = 0.99533334.

Adding 0.0000054444 gives 0.99533878.

So 0.99766667^2 = 0.99533878.

Now, 0.99533878^2.

Again, (1 - 0.00466122)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00466122 + (0.00466122)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.00932244 + 0.000021727.

1 - 0.00932244 = 0.99067756.

Adding 0.000021727 gives 0.99067756 + 0.000021727 = 0.990699287.

So 0.99766667^4 ≈ 0.990699287.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = (0.99766667)^4 ≈ 0.990699.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.990699 ≈ 2.229.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So the correct answer would be option D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, meaning their observed peak wavelengths are equal. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, the intrinsic peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. For Star_1, \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \) since its radial velocity is zero. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Equating the observed wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Using \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T} \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

Substituting \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.997667)^4
\]

Using the binomial expansion or direct computation:

\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 4: Combine Results
Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 5: Match to Options
The closest option to \( 2.229 \) is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
