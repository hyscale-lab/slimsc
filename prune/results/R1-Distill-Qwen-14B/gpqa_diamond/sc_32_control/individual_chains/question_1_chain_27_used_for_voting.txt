Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2, with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two states. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle and lifetimes affecting the energy resolution. Oh right! The energy uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by twice the lifetime. Let me write that down. For E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * τ1) where τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * τ2) with τ2 being 1e-8 seconds.

Wait a second, but I'm supposed to find the energy difference between E2 and E1. So ΔE_total = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference ΔE_total should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe each of their uncertainties?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh, right! When you have two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for either state to be resolvable. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart—they blur together.

So maybe the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let me calculate both uncertainties.

First, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me compute ΔE1:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * τ1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / 2e-9 = approximately 5.27e-26 J.

Wait, but eV is in the options. Let me convert that to eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So,

ΔE1 (eV) = 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly for ΔE2:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * τ2) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = ~5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 /1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainties are about 3.29e-7 eV for E1 and 3.29e-8 eV for E2.

The energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the larger uncertainty to be distinguishable. Which uncertainty is larger? ΔE1 is larger, 3.29e-7 eV.

So, the required ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → way smaller than 3.29e-7. Not enough.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. But wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 10,000 times larger than 3.29e-7. So 1e-4 eV is larger than 3.29e-7 eV. So this would be resolvable.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. Wait, 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 0.000000329. So ΔE in option D is less than the uncertainty in E1, which is the larger uncertainty. So D wouldn't work.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.29e-7 eV. Among the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So the correct answer is option C.

To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the energy uncertainty associated with the states. The energy uncertainty is determined by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: 

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2}.
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we calculate the uncertainties:

1. For \( \Delta E_1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \Delta E_2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). To resolve the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than this value. Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} < 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} < 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} < 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
