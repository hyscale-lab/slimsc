Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's movement towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass (similar to the Sun) each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. They found the RV shifts for each star's spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I vaguely remember is K = (V) which depends on the planet's mass and the period. Or maybe it's K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )^(1/1), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/P)^(1/3) ) / (something else?), but maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the planet's orbital period.

Wait, the key point is that the same star mass and same planet mass (since both are Neptune-like and stars are Sun-like), the only varying factors between the two planets are the semi-amplitude shifts. So the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something?) Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula, but since I can't, I'll try to recall.

I remember that the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (something)) )

Wait, perhaps I should think about Kepler's third law. The RV method relates to the mass function, which is (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ), but perhaps in this case, since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the mass function simplifies.

But wait, the question gives the same masses for the stars and similar planet masses, so M_p is same for both, M_star same for both. So the only difference is the velocity semi-amplitude. So, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period? Or wait, let's think about the formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something?) Hmm, maybe I'm getting this part wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The orbital velocity of the star (causing the Doppler shift) is related to the planet's orbital period. The formula for K is K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me get this right. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ] * [ (1/(P)) ]^(1/3) ) / ( (2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should write it in a more simplified way. Since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and sin i is approximately 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal). So the formula simplifies to K ≈ (G M_p / M_star^(2/3) )^(1/ something) * (1/P)^(1/3) ) / (2π)^(1/something...). Hmm, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward relation.

Wait, another approach: For a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because in the formula, P is in the denominator inside a cube root. So if K is proportional to 1/(P)^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

Wait, let's think in terms of proportionality. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Since both stars and planets have the same mass, M_p is same, M_star same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3).

So, if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. K is proportional to 1/(P)^(1/3). So K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, so if K1 is smaller than K2, that would mean P2 is larger than P1. Because the ratio (K1/K2) is (P2/P1)^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then (K1/K2) is less than 1. So (P2/P1)^(1/3) is less than 1, which implies that P2 < P1. Wait, that can't be right. Because if the RV shift is larger, that suggests a shorter period or something else.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the proportionality. Let me re-express K in terms of P. Since K is proportional to 1/(P)^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So, P ∝ (1/K)^3 → P = C * (1/K)^3, where C is a constant for fixed M_p and M_star.

So, for Planet #1 and #2:

P1 = C * (1/K1)^3

P2 = C * (1/K2)^3

So, the ratio P2/P1 = ( (1/K2)^3 ) / ( (1/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Given that K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7 milliangstrom. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (K1/K2)^3 ≈ (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364 → which is about 0.36.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So, P2 is longer than P1 by a factor of P2/P1.

Wait, no. Wait, if P2/P1 is 0.364, that means P2 is shorter than P1. Because 0.364 is less than 1. So planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1. But the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in which planet corresponds to which shift. Let me recheck.

The problem says: Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 has a 7 milliangstrom shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So, K1 is smaller than K2. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a smaller K implies a longer period. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

So, the periods are P1 and P2. So, P2 is shorter than P1. The question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, it's shorter, so the factor is 0.36. So, P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is P2 = 0.36 * P1. So, P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter than P1, the factor is less than 1. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So, the orbital period of P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36. So the answer is 0.36 times longer. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, which means it's 0.36 times longer. So the factor is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the math. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K1 = 5, K2=7. So, since K2 > K1, P2 < P1. So P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1. So, (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 = 0.364 * P1. So, the orbital period of P2 is approximately 0.36 times that of P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, which is about 0.36 times longer. So the factor is 0.36, which is option A: ~0.36.

So the answer should be option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for stars with similar masses. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the two stars and their planets have similar masses, the RV semi-amplitude \( K \) depends only on the orbital period \( P \). For Planet #1, the RV semi-amplitude is \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \), and for Planet #2, it is \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). The ratio of the orbital periods can be determined using the relationship:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values of \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times the orbital period of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is \( \sim 0.36 \).
