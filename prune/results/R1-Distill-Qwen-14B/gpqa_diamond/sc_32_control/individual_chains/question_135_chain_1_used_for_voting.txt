Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about boson decay. Hmm, I need to figure out the possible decay channels for this boson X based on the given Lagrangian and its mass. Let me think this through step by step.

First, the problem gives the Lagrangian interaction term as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the variables here. Oh, right, λf probably refers to the coupling strength for fermion f. The boson X interacts with these fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, for X to decay, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the decay products' rest masses can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle if they're produced at rest (non-relativistically). But wait, since these are fermion-antifermion pairs, I should consider the combined mass. Oh, wait, each fermion has a rest mass, and when they're produced as a pair, each takes half the energy, but their rest masses add up to the X mass.

Wait no, actually, for a boson at rest decaying into two particles, their rest masses must be less than the boson's mass. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved. So each pair's rest mass must be less than or equal to the X mass.

But wait, X is a boson, and the interaction term shows it's coupling to fermions. So the decay would be X → f f̄, right? So the possible decay products are a fermion and its antiparticle.

So I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs have a combined rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

But wait, each fermion has its own mass. Let me list all the possible fermions and their masses.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But top quark is super heavy, about 173 GeV. So for X=6 GeV, the top quark can't be part of the decay since two top quarks would require 346 GeV, way more than 6. So top is out.

Leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ), and their antiparticles. Let me remember their masses.

Electron: about 0.0005 GeV (but sometimes approximated as 0 for many calculations, but in reality, it's small). However, maybe in this problem, the masses are considered. So, e+ e- would each be about 0.0005 GeV, which is way under 6. Similarly, muon is about 0.1 GeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV.

So for each possible fermion pair, I need their combined mass to be ≤6 GeV.

Let me list all fermions and their masses (approximate):

- u quark: around 2-5 MeV (so 0.002-0.005 GeV)
- d quark: similar to u, maybe around 3-6 MeV
- s quark: around 95-100 MeV
- c quark: about 1.2-1.5 GeV
- b quark: about 4.5-5 GeV
- e lepton: ~0.0005 GeV
- μ lepton: ~0.105 GeV
- τ lepton: ~1.777 GeV
- t quark: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

So when X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their masses must be ≤6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The decay X→ff̄ requires that each f has a mass m such that 2m ≤ M_X. Because when the boson is at rest, the fermion and antifermion would each have energy ≥m, but in the center of mass frame, each would have energy E ≥m. So the minimum energy needed is when they are at rest, which would mean M_X ≥ 2m. So the condition is 2m ≤ M_X.

So for each fermion f, is 2m_f ≤6 GeV?

So let's check each possible fermion.

Quarks:
u: 2*0.005 GeV = 0.01 GeV → yes, allowed.
d: same as u, about 0.01 GeV → yes.
s: 2*0.1 GeV (approx) → 0.2 GeV, so yes.
c: 2*1.5 → 3 GeV → yes.
b: 2*4.5 →9 GeV → no, because 9 >6. So b quark is out.
t: 2*173 → way over, so no.

Leptons:
e: 2*0.0005 → negligible, yes.
μ: 2*0.105 → 0.21 GeV → yes.
τ: 2*1.777 → ~3.55 GeV → yes.

So the allowed fermion pairs are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait: the problem is about the interaction term. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should think about which fermions are being coupled here.

Wait, looking at the Lagrangian again, it's written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like an interaction term where the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So ψ_f could be any of the fermions, but for the decay X→ f f̄, the fermion must be charged under the interaction, meaning that the coupling is non-zero.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So X can interact with any fermion f, so the possible decay products could be any fermion and antifermion pair, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

But wait, perhaps the structure of the Lagrangian tells us which fermions are involved. Let me think: the term is -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). That's a Yukawa coupling term, right? So it's similar to the Yukawa interaction in the Standard Model, like the Higgs coupling to fermions. So each fermion f has its own coupling λf.

So, for each fermion f, as long as it has a non-zero λf, it can be a decay product.

But in the Standard Model, the Higgs (which is a boson) couples to all fermions except the top quark (but in reality, it does couple, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, we don't have that consideration). Wait, but in this problem, perhaps the boson X couples to all fermions, but in reality, the possible decays are only those where the fermion mass allows for 2m ≤ M_X.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So, perhaps X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided that their combined mass is ≤6 GeV.

So, possible decay products must be any pair where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, let's list possible f:

u: 2m_u ≈ 0.01 GeV → allowed.

d: same, allowed.

s: 2m_s ≈ 0.2 GeV → allowed.

c: 2m_c ≈ 3 GeV → allowed.

b: 2m_b ≈9 GeV → not allowed.

t: way too big, not allowed.

Leptons:

e: allowed.

mu: allowed.

tau: 2*m_tau≈3.55 GeV → allowed.

So possible decay channels are into pairs of u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

But wait, b's 2m is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass 6 GeV. So b is not allowed. So option A includes b which isn't allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So, c is allowed (2m_c ~3 GeV), s (0.2 GeV), u, d allowed. tau: 3.55 GeV → allowed. mu: 0.21 GeV → allowed. e: allowed. So all these are allowed. So B looks correct.

Wait, but what about the tau pair? 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau is allowed.

Option C: includes t tbar, which is impossible because 2m_t is way bigger. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b bbar again, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Let me look again.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the decay channels \( X \to f \bar{f} \), where \( f \) is a fermion. The key condition is that the combined rest mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \): \( 2m_u \approx 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( d \): \( 2m_d \approx 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( s \): \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( c \): \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( b \): \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, exceeds \( M_X \)).
   - \( t \): \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far exceeds \( M_X \)).

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e \): \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \mu \): \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \tau \): \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

Thus, the allowed fermion-antifermion pairs are \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > M_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg M_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
