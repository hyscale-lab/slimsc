Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, involving different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by distance d (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. So if I have a distance r (assuming r is in parsecs, same as d), then plx would be 1/r.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we need to find the relationship between N and r, given N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Let me write this out. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Simplify that. (1/(1/r))^5 is the same as r^5. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is 1/(1/r^5) ), which is r^5. Oh right, because (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so the reciprocal is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait, wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So that's the number per unit distance? Or the total number? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of differential number of stars with respect to distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume or something else. Oh wait, no, the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So I think it's the change in the number of stars as you move a certain distance r. So maybe it's the rate of change, like dN/dr.

Wait, so if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, that's only if N is proportional to r^5. But the question is saying that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which I converted to N proportional to r^5 because plx is 1/r.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The number of stars in the region varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr. Because if you imagine a spherical shell at radius r with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell is dN, which would be proportional to the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars. But wait, in this case, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so perhaps the number density is different.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's think about it as a function of distance. If N is proportional to r^5, then when r increases, N increases as r^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's the gradient, or the rate of change of N with r. So dN/dr is the change per unit distance.

So if N = k * r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4, which would mean that the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance. But let's look at the options again.

The options are A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So when you go to a larger distance r, the number of stars N is proportional to r^5. But how does N change as you move a small distance dr? That's dN = (dN/dr) dr. So the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the number of stars in a region of space between r and r+dr is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to r^5, but the shell's volume is 4π r^2 dr. So the number density, which is stars per unit volume, would be number / (volume) = (r^5) / (4π r^2 dr) ) = r^3/(4π dr). Hmm, but that's not directly the question. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps the change is dN = (dN/dr) dr, which is proportional to r^4 dr. So per unit dr, the number increases by r^4 per unit r.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/(plx))^5. And since plx = 1/r, this becomes N = k * r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But the question is about the change per unit range of distance. So perhaps if you consider a small change in r, the number of stars in that interval would be proportional to r^5. Hmm, but that wouldn't make sense because when you go from r to r+dr, the change in N would be N(r+dr) - N(r) ≈ dN/dr * dr = (5k r^4) dr. So the number of stars added per unit distance dr would be proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes in these problems, you might see that the number of stars in a thin shell (like a volume element) depends on both the volume and the density, but in this case, the question explicitly states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number of stars in a given direction (like a line of sight) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Therefore, when considering a range of distances, the number of stars in a thin shell would involve the number per direction multiplied by the area or something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as the number of stars per unit volume. Let me try that.

Number density n(r) is the number of stars per unit volume. So if the number of stars in a volume V is N, then N = integral of n(r) dV.

But in this case, the problem states that N varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, but maybe N is the number of stars along a line of sight. Oh wait, no, the problem says in a specific region of the sky, so perhaps it's a fixed area on the sky, and the number of stars in that area at a distance r.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a volume. The number of stars in a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr is dN = n(r) * (4π r^2 dr), where n(r) is the number density (stars per volume).

But according to the problem, the number of stars in that region (for a given r) varies as 1/plx^5. Wait, but plx is in the denominator, and plx is 1/r. So 1/(plx)^5 is r^5. So for a fixed area on the sky, the number of stars at distance r is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that can't be right because when you look further away, you should see fewer stars if they are spread out. But according to this, the number increases with r^5, which would imply more stars at larger distances, which seems counterintuitive. Hmm, maybe I need to think about this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars per unit area per unit distance, which is like the surface density times the distance. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me try to formalize this. The number of stars in a region of the sky (a certain solid angle) at a distance r is given by N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. But that can't be right, because when you're looking further away (larger r), you'd expect fewer stars in that direction if the density is uniform, but according to this, N increases with r^5, which would mean more stars at larger distances. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in that region varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k / (plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = k r^5. But that would mean, as r increases, N increases as r^5. That seems odd because if you look further away, more stars would be in that direction, which I'm not sure is correct. So perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, which depends on both the number per unit area and the distance. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: in the galaxy, the number of stars per unit volume (number density) might be roughly constant, but when considering a fixed area on the sky, the number of stars in that area within a distance r and r+dr is the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell (4π r² dr) and the area. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV, where n is number density. The volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell is n * 4π r² dr. So if the number of stars in a certain region (like a fixed area) varies as 1/plx^5, that would mean that for each direction, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that would imply that for each direction, the number of stars increases with r^5, which again doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the problem.

The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So number N = C / plx^5 = C * r^5.

The question is: how does the number of stars in that region change with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps they are asking about dN/dr, the rate of change of N with r.

So N = C r^5 → dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the answer would be option C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial setup seems to suggest that N increases with r^5, which would imply more stars at larger distances, which seems counterintuitive if the number density is constant. But perhaps in this problem's scenario, the number of stars increases with distance, which is what the mathematics is showing.

So to recap, the steps are:

1. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.
2. plx = 1/r → 1/plx = r.
3. So replacing, N ∝ r^5.
4. Then, the change in N with respect to r is dN/dr ∝ r^4.
5. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4, so the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely related to distance \( r \) (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). This corresponds to finding the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Differentiating \( N \propto r^5 \), we get \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). 

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
