Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm going to think out loud, even if I make some mistakes along the way.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing a gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid with substance X has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X is used in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

First, I need to figure out what substance X is. Let me think about reagents used in organic chemistry. One that comes to mind is sodium (Na), but wait, sodium is an alkali metal. Another possibility is something like hydroxide, maybe NaOH? Or perhaps it's something like a Grignard reagent, which involves Mg. Wait, Grignard reagents are used in organic synthesis, so Mg might be involved here.

Wait, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is Mg, the heavier isotope would be Mg-25 or Mg-26? Because the common isotope is Mg-24. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe X is something like Hg's isotope? No, that might not fit.

Let me look at another part of the question. The gas W released has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about gases released in reactions. Common gases include H2, O2, NH3, CO2, etc. Wait, if W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, let's calculate for some possibilities.

Take H2: each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since protium has one isotope). So W as H2 would have 1 proton and 0 neutrons per molecule. That doesn't match because protons (1) and neutrons (0) aren't equal. So H2 is out.

What about O2? Oxygen has 8 protons. Oxygen-16 has 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 8 protons and 16 neutrons per molecule. Wait, but per molecule, each O atom contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons (for O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh wait, but wait, no—each O atom has 8 protons and, say, 8 neutrons. So each O has 8 p and 8 n. Two O atoms would make O2 with 16 p and 16 n. So per molecule, 16 each. So protons and neutrons are equal. That fits W.

So gas W is O2? But wait, when would a reaction produce O2? Maybe when an oxide is formed or decomposed. Another possibility is CO2, but wait, let me check. CO2 has 1 C and 2 O atoms. C has 6 p and 6 n (for C-12), O has 8 p and 8 n. So each CO2 molecule would have 14 p (6+8) and 14 n (6+8), so p and n are equal. That also fits. Hmm, so W could be either O2 or CO2. Or maybe another gas.

Wait, let's see. The reaction is between X and Y (a liquid), producing W and G. If X is Na, then maybe Y is water. Na reacts with water to produce H2 (but that's not matching W's description). No, wait, Na + H2O → NaOH + H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit because protons and neutrons aren't equal. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if X is Mg and Y is an acid, perhaps? Mg reacts with acid to produce H2, again same issue.

Wait, another reaction: maybe the reaction is between a metal and a carbonate. For example, Mg and CO3^2-. Let me think: MgCO3 is magnesium carbonate. If a metal reacts with a carbonate, perhaps it produces CO2 gas. So let me see:

If X is Mg, and Y is a carbonate solution, then Mg + CO3^2- → MgCO3, but that might not produce gas. Alternatively, maybe Mg reacts with a carbonate in acid? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a solution of a nitrate or sulfate. Maybe Y is an acid, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What compounds have a melting point around there? Well, water freezes at 273 K (0°C). So 277 K is a bit higher, maybe something like ice? Or perhaps another substance.

Wait, when G is heated and releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. If B is a solid, perhaps it's something like CO2 (dry ice) which has a melting point of about 195 K? No, that's too low. Wait, let me recall. The melting point of water is 273 K. So B's melting point is about 277 K, very close to water's. Hmm, maybe B is some other substance with similar properties.

Alternatively, could B be something like sodium chloride? No, that's solid with higher melting point.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Let me think, when a precipitate is formed and then heated, what could release a solid with a melting point near 277 K. Maybe the precipitate is magnesium hydroxide? Mg(OH)2 is a precipitate, which when heated, might decompose. Let's think about that.

Mg(OH)2 when heated decomposes into MgO and H2O. So, when heated, it would release H2O. H2O's melting point is 273 K. So B would be H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K. The question says it's very close to 277 K. Hmm, that's a 4 K difference. Maybe some experimental error, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Another possibility: if the precipitate is something like calcium carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. So B would be CO2, but CO2's melting point is way lower. Wait, no, CO2 is a gas at room temperature. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the precipitate is something like copper hydroxide. Cu(OH)2 is a precipitate. When heated, it might decompose into CuO and H2O. So, again, B would be H2O. So that matches the melting point around 273 K, which is near 277 K.

Wait, but the question says that when G is heated, it releases B. So in the case of Mg(OH)2, you get H2O as a gas, but it's a liquid at STP. Hmm, maybe the problem isn't about the state, but the melting point. So B's melting point is near 277 K, which aligns with H2O's 273 K. So perhaps B is H2O, released as vapor when the precipitate is heated.

So, if that's the case, then the precipitate G is Mg(OH)2, formed when Mg reacts with Y (like an acid or another solution). So Y could be an acid, like HCl or H2SO4.

Wait, but if X is Mg, and Y is HCl, then Mg + HCl → MgCl2 + H2 gas. But earlier, I thought that W is O2 or CO2, but in this case, H2 would be the gas. Which doesn't fit the condition of W's molecule having equal p and n. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe Y is not an acid but another solution. Let's think again.

If X is Mg, and Y is a solution of a carbonate. Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + NaOH? Wait, I'm not sure about that reaction. Alternatively, perhaps Mg and a solution of a nitrate. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is sodium (Na), and Y is an acid. For example, Na + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2(g). But again, H2 doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.

Let me think about the product of a certain keto acid with X. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, the product after the reaction has 2 O atoms. If X is Mg, perhaps the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). If Mg reacts with acetic acid, it would produce Mg acetate, hydrogen gas, etc. The product would be Mg(CH3COO)2, which has multiple oxygens. Wait, but how many O atoms per formula unit? Each acetate ion has 2 O, so Mg(CH3COO)2 would have four O in the acetate groups. Hmm, but the problem says that the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. That doesn't add up. Unless the product is something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hydroxide. Like, if X is Mg, and the keto acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH). Mg + HCOOH → MgCO3 + H2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a salt formation. Hmm, maybe the product is Mg(OOCCH3) or something, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two oxygens because it's something like a metal oxide. For instance, maybe when Mg reacts with the acid, it forms MgO and water. But that would be a reaction like 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO, but that's combustion, not with an acid.

Wait, maybe the keto acid is something else. Let me think about possible products. Suppose the product is a carboxylate salt. For example, if the keto acid is propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH), then Mg would react to form Mg(CH2CH2COO)2. Each acetate group has two O, so the formula would have 4 O. But the problem says the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an oxide, like MgO. MgO has one O per formula unit. But the problem says 2 O atoms in the product. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hydroxide. Mg(OH)2 has two O and two H. So each molecule has two O atoms. But the product is formed when X reacts with the keto acid. So how would Mg react with a keto acid? Maybe the keto acid is something like glycolic acid, which has a simple structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is another element. Let's consider something else. What if X is carbon? No, that doesn't fit the earlier parts. Or perhaps X is something like sulfur? Not sure.

Wait, another approach. The problem mentions that X's analog is used in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents (like Mg-based) are used, so perhaps X is Mg. Let me proceed under the assumption that X is Mg.

So, if X is Mg, when it reacts with liquid Y (maybe an acid), it produces a gas W. Let me think about the reaction: Mg + HCl → MgCl2 + H2↑. But H2 is the gas. Does that fit the W description? Earlier, I thought that W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. H2 has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since H is typically ^1H). So 1 vs 0, which is not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but if W is CO2, then the reaction would have to produce CO2. How would Mg reacting with something produce CO2? Mg and carbonate? Let's say Y is a carbonate solution, like Na2CO3. Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + NaOH. Wait, but MgCO3 is slightly soluble, maybe precipitates. So the gas wouldn't be CO2 in that case.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a sulfide. Mg + H2S → MgS + H2↑. Again, H2 as gas. Not matching.

Hmm, another possibility: W is CO2. How else can Mg react to produce CO2? Maybe with a carbonate. But in that case, perhaps Y is something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple acid-base. Maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps Y is H2O, and Mg reacts with it. But that would produce H2 gas, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W isn't O2 or CO2. What about something like NH3? NH3 has 1 N and 3 H. Nitrogen has 7 p and 7 n (for ^14N), but hydrogen has 1 p and 0 n. So per molecule, NH3 has (7+3*1) = 10 p and (7 + 0) =7 n. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe W is a noble gas. For example, Ar has 38 electrons, so protons = 38, neutrons = 38 (if it's ^76Ar). Then Ar gas would have 38 p and 38 n per atom. So per molecule, same. But Ar is a noble gas, so would that fit the reaction?

Hmm, but how would Mg react to produce Ar? That seems unlikely. Maybe if Y is a solution containing Ar, but that's not a typical reaction.

Wait, perhaps W is O2. Let's reevaluate that scenario.

If X is Mg, Y is an oxide solution. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps Y is a peroxide. Mg and H2O2: I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, X could be something else. Let me think about other reagents in organic chemistry. For example, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent. But that's a hydride. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The reaction of X with Y produces a precipitate. If Y is a solution of a salt, maybe something like AgNO3. So if X is Na, then Na + AgNO3 → Ag + NaNO3. But Ag is a solid precipitate. Then, when heated, Ag would just stay as Ag, which has a melting point of around 961°C, which is way higher than 4°C.

Alternatively, if X is Mg and Y is AgNO3 solution, Mg would displace Ag: Mg + 2AgNO3 → Mg(NO3)2 + 2Ag↓. So G would be Ag. When heated, Ag remains as Ag, not releasing any gas. That doesn't fit with B being a gas or a substance with a melting point near 277 K.

Hmm, perhaps the precipitate isn't a metal. Maybe it's a hydroxide. So, if X is Mg and Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, like Al(NO3)3, then Mg would react to produce Mg(NO3)2 and Al. But Al is a metal, not a precipitate. Or perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, Mg and Cu(OH)2 would react under certain conditions, maybe to produce Cu and Mg(OH)2. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and the precipitate is the metal carbonate. For example, Mg and Na2CO3 → MgCO3↓ + 2NaOH. Then, MgCO3 would be the precipitate. When heated, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. So, B would be CO2 gas. But CO2's melting point is much lower (like -56°C), which is 217 K. 217 K is not 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says B has a melting point close to 277 K. So 217 K is 60 K away. That's a big difference. So, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, let's think about the product with a keto acid. The product has 2 O atoms. If X is Mg, and the product is MgO, that has one O. No. Or perhaps the product is Mg(OH)2, which has two O atoms. So the product would be Mg(OH)2, which has two O per molecule. That fits the condition of containing two O atoms.

So, how does Mg react with a keto acid to form Mg(OH)2? Well, Mg is a metal, and keto acids are organic acids with a ketone group. Maybe the reaction is between Mg and the acid to form a salt and water. For example:

Mg + HCOOH → MgCO3↓ + H2↑. Wait, but that would be a carbonate, not hydroxide. Or:

Mg + HCOOH → Mg(OH)CO3 + H2↑. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Mg with a ketone. For example, benzophenone and Mg in ether forms a Grignard reagent. But that's a different scenario, and the product is an organomagnesium compound, not a hydroxide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the possibility that X is another element.

Another possibility: X is carbon, but that's less likely. Or perhaps X is sodium (Na). Let's think about sodium.

If X is Na, reacting with Y (a liquid) could produce gas W. For example, Na and H2O → NaOH + H2. But H2 as gas doesn't fit. Alternatively, Na with alcohol (liquid) produces H2. Again, same issue.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a carbonate. Na + Na2CO3 → Na2CO3 + Na (maybe not, that's a decomposition). Alternatively, Na and a nitrate solution? Maybe a reaction that produces O2. If Na is in a solution with a nitrate, maybe it's a decomposition reaction that produces O2. For example, sodium nitrate decomposes upon heating to produce Na2O, NO2, and O2. But that's thermal decomposition, not a reaction with a liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O2, produced by a reaction between X and Y. If X is Na, how would that happen? Maybe if Y is a solution of a permanganate in acidic conditions. Na and KMnO4 in acid → Na+ + Mn^2+ + etc. and O2 gas. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

In that case, O2 would be W. So each O2 molecule has 8 p and 8 n (if it's O-16). So 8 each, which fits the condition.

So, if X is Na, and Y is a solution of KMnO4 in H2SO4, then Na reacts with KMnO4 to produce MnSO4, K2SO4, Na2SO4, and O2 gas. That could be plausible.

Then the precipitate G would be something else. Wait, perhaps the reaction produces MnO2 as a precipitate? Or maybe it's a different product. Maybe I'm getting off track here.

Wait, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's say G is a manganese oxide, like MnO2. When heated, MnO2 doesn't decompose (maybe at high temps), but in some cases, it can produce O2. But that's not matching with the melting point.

Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, like NaOH, but NaOH doesn't release anything upon heating. Wait, no, NaOH is a solid that doesn't decompose under normal heating. So that might not work.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to list what I know so far.

1. X is a reagent used in organic chemistry, possibly Mg (Grignard reagents) or Na (for other reactions).

2. X has a heavier isotope. So, if X is Mg, the isotopes are Mg-24 (most common), Mg-25, Mg-26. So heavier would be Mg-25 or 26.

3. Gas W has same number of protons and neutrons per molecule. Possibilities: O2 (8 p and 8 n each → 16 each per molecule), CO2 (12 p and 12 n per molecule, since 6 p in C, 8 p in O; 6+8=14 p? Wait, no. Wait, CO2 is one C and two O. Each O has 8 p and 8 n, so CO2 has 6 + 8*2 = 22 p. Neutrons: 6 (C-12) + 8*2 (O-16) = 22 n. So total p =22, n=22. So yes, per molecule, it fits.

So W could be CO2.

4. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B with a melting point near 277 K. If B is H2O (273 K), then what's G? It must be a compound that when heated yields H2O.

So, if G is a hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, when heated it decomposes into MgO and H2O. So B is H2O, which fits the melting point.

Putting it all together:

- X is Mg.

- X reacts with Y (maybe a carbonate solution) to form MgCO3 (precipitate G) and CO2 gas (W).

Wait, but earlier I thought Y might be a carbonate, but if X is Mg and Y is a carbonate solution, the reaction would be Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + 2 Na. But MgCO3 isn't very soluble, so it precipitates. Then, upon heating MgCO3, it would decompose into MgO and CO2. So B would be CO2, but CO2's melting point is much lower. So that's a problem.

Wait, but if G is MgCO3, heating would produce CO2. But earlier I thought G is Mg(OH)2, which would produce H2O. There's a contradiction here.

Another possibility: If Y is a hydroxide solution, like NaOH. Mg reacts with NaOH to produce Mg(OH)2 and Na. So the reaction: Mg + 2 NaOH → Mg(OH)2 ↓ + 2 Na. Then, Mg(OH)2 is G. When heated, Mg(OH)2 → MgO + H2O. So B is H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K, very close to 277 K mentioned. That fits.

So, in this scenario:

- X is Mg.

- Y is NaOH (a liquid, though NaOH is a solid, but maybe it's a solution).

- Reaction: Mg + 2 NaOH → Mg(OH)2 ↓ + 2 Na.

- Gas W: Hmm, in this reaction, no gas is produced. So that's a problem. Because the question says a gas W is released.

Wait, that's an issue. So perhaps Y isn't NaOH. What else could Y be?

Alternatively, Y could be a solution of a sulfate, like Al2(SO4)3. Mg would react with sulfate to produce MgSO4 and a precipitate. But I'm not sure about the products.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a halide. For example, Mg reacts with a solution of a halide, like AgNO3, producing Mg(NO3)2 and Ag precipitate. But then, the gas W would be nothing, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me approach the problem from another angle.

The product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. So, if X is Mg, and the product is MgO, that has one O. If the product is Mg(OH)2, that has two O per formula unit. So perhaps the reaction is Mg with a keto acid to form Mg(OH)2 and release some gas.

Wait, Mg and a keto acid (like CH3COOH) would react in a neutralization reaction: Mg + 2 CH3COOH → Mg(CH3COO)2 + H2↑. So, the product is Mg acetate and hydrogen gas. Mg acetate has formula Mg(CH3COO)2, which has four O atoms per formula unit (each acetate has two O). But the problem states the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is MgO, which has one O. But that would require a reaction without any OH groups. Maybe Mg is oxidized in the presence of a keto acid. For example, in a basic solution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a hydrate. If the product is Mg(OH)2·nH2O, that would have more O, but not sure.

Another approach: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, what elements are present in X?

If X is Mg, it's just Mg. So the elements are Mg. But that's a single element. So the lightest and heaviest would be the same (since it's only Mg). So the cumulative mass would be 24.305 (approx). But the options don't have 24; the closest is option B (25). So maybe that's a possibility.

But wait, the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is Mg, it's a single element, so sum is just Mg. 24.305, but options are 35,25,31,29.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound. Could X be something like MgH2? Unlikely, as Mg typically forms MgH2 only under specific conditions. Or perhaps X is a mixture of elements, but that seems odd.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of isotopes, but the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is a compound with multiple elements, like Mg and another element.

Wait, but earlier I thought X is Mg. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track, and X is something else.

Wait, let's think about the product with the keto acid. The product has 2 O atoms. So, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about metals that when reacting with a keto acid would produce a product with two O atoms.

For example, if X is Fe, and the keto acid is something like oxalic acid (HO2CCOOH), then Fe would react to form Fe oxalate. FeC2O4·2H2O, which has four O's. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a transition metal that forms a hydroxide with two O atoms. Like, for example, Fe(OH)2, which has two O and two H. But how would that fit the rest?

Wait, another approach. The product of X and the keto acid has 2 O atoms. So if the product is a metal oxide, like FeO, that has one O. So not matching. Alternatively, a peroxide, but that's more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicarbonate, but that's stretching it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to go back to the initial parts.

Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents (like Mg) are used, so X could be Mg. Then, the product of X and a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce a salt, such as Mg acetate, which has formula Mg(CH3COO)2. Each acetate group has two O's, so per formula unit, four O's. But the question says the product has two O atoms. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a different compound, such as a basic carbonate. Or perhaps the reaction is different. Wait, maybe it's a double displacement reaction. For example, Mg reacting with a keto acid to form Mg salt and water. So, the product would be Mg(OH)2, which has two O per molecule.

So, if the product is Mg(OH)2, that fits the two O condition. Then, how does that happen? Mg would react with a strong acid, but that would produce Mg^2+ and H2 gas. How does that fit with the earlier parts?

Wait, perhaps the keto acid is acting as a base. Like, if the keto acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH), which can act as a base in some reactions. Maybe Mg reacts with formic acid to form MgCO3 and release H2 gas. But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between Mg and a ketone. But that's a Grignard reaction, which is more about forming organomagnesium compounds, not producing salts.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the options given.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

These are the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

If X is Mg (24.3), then the sum would be 24.3 (since it's a single element). But the options don't have 24; the closest is B)25, which is near 24.3. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, if X is a compound containing two different elements, then the sum would be the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present.

For example, if X is Na (23), and another element is Cl (35.5), then Na and Cl sum to 23 + 35.5 = 58.5. That's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or N2. But those are elements, not compounds.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of isotopes of the same element. But then it's still the same element, so the sum would be just that element's mass.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. If X is Mg, sum is ~24.3, which is closest to option B)25.

Another angle: The question says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, if X is Mg, and the product is MgO, which has one O atom. That doesn't fit. If the product is MgO2, that's not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diatomic O molecule, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hydrate. For example, Mg(OH)2·nH2O, which would have more O's, but the question says 2 O atoms.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the product. Perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms in total, not per formula unit. So, if the product is H2O, that has one O per molecule. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the product is CO2, that has two O per molecule. Wait, no, CO2 has two O's per molecule. So maybe the product is CO2? But how would Mg react with a keto acid to form CO2?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is something else. I'm getting stuck here.

In any case, considering the options, if X is Mg, the sum is ~24.3. The closest option is B)25. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)29, if X is another element.

Wait, another possibility: X is Hg. Hg has isotopes, and its atomic mass is about 200.7. But the product with a keto acid would be Hg salt, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, X could be another metal like Fe. But I don't see a clear fit.

Another thought: if X is a halogen, like Cl2, but that's a diatomic element. When Cl2 reacts with a liquid, perhaps Y is a hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem's answer is 25, which would correspond to Na (23) and O (16). 23+16=39, no. Wait, maybe the elements are Na and Cl (23 +35.5=58.5). Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if X is Na, and the elements are Na and H. 23 +1=24, which is close to option B (25).

Wait, but if X is Na, then the product with a keto acid would be a sodium salt. For example, if the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), the product would be NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate). That has 3 O atoms. But the question says the product has 2 O atoms. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is NaOH, but that has one O.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me sum up:

Assuming X is Mg, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X (which is just Mg) would be ~24.3. The option closest is B)25.

But wait, the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is a compound, it could have multiple elements. For example, if X is MgCl2, then the elements are Mg and Cl. The lightest is Mg (24.3), heaviest Cl (35.45). Sum is ~59.75, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Close to B)25.

Wait, but earlier I considered that the reaction would produce a precipitate G when X reacts with Y. If X is NaOH, but that's a base, not a reagent in organic chemistry except in certain contexts. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of Mg and another element, but I'm not sure.

In the interest of time and considering the options, I think the intended answer is B)25, assuming X is Mg (24.3), and perhaps the option accounts for rounding.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to release Gas W and form Precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, a substance with a melting point close to 277 K. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The goal is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Substance X**:
   - X is a reagent in organic chemistry, suggesting it could be a metal like Mg (used in Grignard reagents) or Na.
   - X incorporates a heavier isotope, which aligns with Mg, as it has isotopes like Mg-25 and Mg-26.

2. **Gas W**:
   - W has the same number of protons and neutrons per molecule. Possible candidates are O₂ (8 protons and 8 neutrons) or CO₂ (14 protons and 14 neutrons).
   - If X is Mg, reactions with acids or carbonates could produce CO₂, fitting the description of W.

3. **Precipitate G and B**:
   - G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is near the melting point of water (273 K). This suggests B could be water (H₂O), and G might be a hydroxide like Mg(OH)₂, which decomposes into MgO and H₂O upon heating.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**:
   - The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. If X is Mg, Mg(OH)₂ fits this condition, as it has two oxygen atoms per formula unit.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**:
   - If X is Mg, it is a single element with an atomic mass of approximately 24.3. The lightest and heaviest elements in X are both Mg, so the cumulative atomic mass is ~24.3.
   - Among the options, the closest value is **25**, which likely accounts for rounding.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible identity for X is Mg, and the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (both Mg) sum to approximately 24.3. The closest option is **25**.

**Answer: B**
