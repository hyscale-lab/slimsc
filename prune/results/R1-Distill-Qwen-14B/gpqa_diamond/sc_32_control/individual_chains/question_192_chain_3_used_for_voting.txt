Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some basic concepts. I remember that conductors have some important properties regarding electric fields and charges. For one, the electric field inside a conductor (the material part, not the cavity) is zero. Also, charges reside on the surface of a conductor in electrostatic conditions. But wait, the conductor here is initially uncharged. So any charges would have to come from something else. Oh, wait, the charge +q is placed inside the cavity. How does that affect the conductor?

I think that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. For a conductor, the charges redistribute themselves. So the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have an induced charge opposite to the cavity's charge. Since the charge in the cavity is +q, the inner surface will have -q. But wait, the conductor itself was uncharged, so the outer surface must then have +q, because the total charge on the conductor is the sum of the inner and outer charges. Oh wait, no. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the total charge on it must remain zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer. Wait, no, wait. If the conductor is neutral, then the inner surface has -q (due to induction by the +q in the cavity), and the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The conductor as a whole is neutral. The charge in the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q because it's induced by the +q. Then, since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer. So if inner is -q, outer must be +q, so that -q + (+q) = 0, which matches the conductor being neutral. Wait, no, that would make the total charge zero. So the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize this. The conductor is neutral. A charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is sum of inner and outer: (-q) + (+q) = 0, so the conductor remains neutral. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, but wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the inner surface has -q and the outer +q? But wait, that would mean the conductor as a whole has a charge of zero, which is correct.

So, the outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, when we're looking for the electric field outside the conductor, at point P, which is outside the conductor's radius R. How does the electric field behave there?

I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface. So, if I imagine a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L > R), the enclosed charge is the outer charge plus any other charges inside. But wait, in this case, the charge in the cavity is +q, and the outer surface is +q. So the total enclosed charge (the charge within the Gaussian surface) would be +q (from the outer surface) plus the charge inside the cavity, which is +q. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the charge in the cavity is inside the Gaussian surface, so when you calculate the flux through the Gaussian surface, you include all charges inside, including the +q in the cavity and the outer conductor's +q. So the total enclosed charge is q (cavity) + q (outer) = 2q? That can't be right because the conductor is neutral... Wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface has charge +q. The total charge inside the Gaussian surface (which includes the conductor and the cavity) is q (cavity) plus +q (outer), which is 2q? But that would make the flux dependent on 2q, which can't be correct because the conductor being neutral would have no net charge. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the sum is zero: -q (inner) + q (outer) = 0. So when considering the Gaussian surface outside the conductor, which encloses the conductor and the cavity, the total enclosed charge is the charge in the cavity (q) plus the inner surface (-q) plus the outer surface (+q). But the inner and outer charges sum to zero, so the total charge inside the Gaussian surface is q (from the cavity) + 0 = q.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the Gaussian surface would include the cavity, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface is the charge in the cavity (q) plus the charges on the inner and outer surfaces (which are -q and +q respectively). So q + (-q) + (+q) = q. So the total enclosed charge is q.

But wait, when the conductor is neutral, the charge on the outer surface is such that the total conductor's charge is zero. So let me think: The conductor's net charge is zero. The inner surface has -q (as induced by the +q in the cavity), so the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. Therefore, the outer surface has +q.

So, when we apply Gauss's Law, the Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L) encloses the conductor and the cavity. The total charge inside this Gaussian surface is the sum of the cavity's charge (+q) and the conductor's charges. The conductor's charges are: inner surface (-q) and outer surface (+q). So summing all, the total inside the Gaussian is q (cavity) + (-q + q) (conductor) = q (since the conductor's charges sum to zero). So the enclosed charge is q.

Wait, but that can't be right because the conductor is neutral. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The Gaussian surface encloses the conductor and the cavity. The charge from the Gaussian surface's perspective is the charge inside it, which is the charge in the cavity (q) and the charges on the conductor. The conductor's charges are inner (-q) and outer (+q), which sum to zero. So the total enclosed charge is q + 0 = q.

Wait, that's correct. Because the Gaussian surface is outside the conductor. The conductor's charges are on the outer surface and inner surface. But the Gaussian surface includes all of the conductor and the cavity. So the charge inside is q (cavity) plus inner (-q) plus outer (+q). So the total is q + (-q + q) = q. So the enclosed charge is q.

Wait, but the conductor's net charge is zero, so how can the enclosed charge be q? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the conductor's charge and the total charge inside the Gaussian surface. The conductor is neutral, so its own charges sum to zero. But the Gaussian surface also includes the charge in the cavity, which is +q. So the total enclosed charge (cavity + conductor) is q.

But wait, no. The conductor's inner surface has -q, which is part of the conductor. The outer surface has +q. So the conductor's total is zero. The cavity has +q, so the total inside the Gaussian is q (cavity) plus (-q + q) (conductor) = q.

Therefore, the electric flux through the Gaussian surface is Φ = E * 4πL² = (q_enclosed)/(ε₀). So E = (q/(4πε₀ L²)). So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the sum of the enclosed charges, which in this case is q.

Wait, but then looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Which matches this result. So that's the field at point P.

But wait, the options also have other possibilities, like options A and C, which involve l and s and cos theta. How do these fit into the picture?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Because the charge is placed somewhere inside the cavity, but the cavity's center is not at the same point as the conductor's center. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the charge is located at some point inside the cavity, which is itself off-center within the conductor.

Hmm, this complicates things. Because in the previous reasoning, I assumed the charge is at the center of the cavity, but here the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the +q is somewhere inside the cavity, which is itself not at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the charge is placed inside the cavity. So the position matters. But when calculating the electric field outside the conductor, does the position of the charge inside the cavity matter? Because the conductor's charges would redistribute in a way that the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, as we reasoned earlier. But wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Because when the charge is inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So when +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, to keep the conductor's net charge zero.

So, the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's distributed on the outer shell. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. But wait, no, because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly, regardless of the internal setup. So the field outside is as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

But then, the position of the charge inside the cavity and the displacement of the cavity's center (at distance s from the conductor's center) might affect the inner field, but not the outer field because the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the cavity is not centered at the conductor's center, and the charge is inside the cavity, would that cause the outer surface's charge distribution to be non-uniform? No, because the conductor is a sphere, so the charges on the outer surface would still arrange themselves uniformly, regardless of the internal setup.

Wait, no, that's only true when the internal charge distribution is spherically symmetric with respect to the conductor's center. If the charge inside the cavity isn't at the center, perhaps the conductor's charges wouldn't distribute uniformly. Hmm, this is getting more complicated.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. The problem is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the field outside would be as if the charge +q is located at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed.

Wait, but that can't be right because the charge inside the cavity is placed asymmetrically. But for a conductor, the charges on the outer surface rearrange themselves to ensure that the field inside the conductor is zero. So the field outside depends only on the total charge on the conductor, regardless of where it's placed inside.

Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface's charge distribution depends on the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor's material is equipotential, the outer surface's charge distribution will be such that the field outside is as if the charge is located at the center.

Wait, but if the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, perhaps the inner surface's charge distribution is non-uniform. But the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q because the inner surface has -q and the conductor was neutral. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed because the conductor is spherical. So the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. And the angle between l and s is theta. So the position of the charge inside the cavity might affect the field inside the conductor, but not outside.

Wait, but no, because outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. So the field outside depends only on that. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge is +q, and the field outside is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²) in magnitude, directed radially outward.

Looking back at the options, option B is exactly this expression. So the answer should be option B.

But wait, why do the other options involve l and s and theta? I thought that the field outside doesn't depend on the internal configuration, but only on the total charge on the outer surface. So why would the position of P relative to the cavity's center affect the field? It shouldn't, because the field outside is due to the +q on the outer surface, which is uniformly distributed and centered at the conductor's center.

Wait, but I'm considering point P. Let me think about the setup again. The conductor has radius R, the cavity is inside, not centered. The charge is in the cavity, off-center. The point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s (the displacement vector from conductor's center to cavity's center) is theta.

So the point P's position relative to the cavity's center could influence the field if the charge inside the cavity were not screened. But in reality, the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is uniformly distributed. So the field from the outer surface at point P would be as if the +q were at the conductor's center.

Wait, but perhaps the charge inside the cavity induces a dipole or some other configuration, but in this case, since the conductor is spherical and the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside is radial and depends only on the distance L.

So the correct answer is option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²).


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (due to electrostatic induction). Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the total charge.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface. For a Gaussian surface of radius $L$ (where $L > R$), the total enclosed charge is the sum of the charge in the cavity ($+q$) and the charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. The inner surface has $-q$, and the outer surface has $+q$, so their contributions cancel out. Thus, the total enclosed charge is $+q$.

3. **Gauss's Law**: Using Gauss's law, the electric flux through the Gaussian surface is:
   \[
   \Phi = E \cdot 4 \pi L^2 = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}.
   \]
   Solving for $E$, we find:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Position of $P$ Relative to the Cavity**: The position of $P$ relative to the cavity's center (distance $l$, angle $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor does not depend on the relative positions of $P$ and the cavity.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Suggests the field depends only on $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
