Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. Let me parse it. So the line element depends on x and y, and the denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²). I remember that metrics often describe the geometry of spacetime, but here it's a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy only. So this is a 2D surface.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere—maybe I should think about what a pseudosphere is. Pseudosphere is a term used in hyperbolic geometry, right? It's like a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, sometimes in relativity, "pseudosphere" might refer to something else. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be a sphere?

Wait, the options have 4π(x² + y²) and similar. So the area being 4π r², which is the area of a sphere. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh wait, maybe the term is a red herring. Or perhaps the metric is that of a sphere or a pseudosphere.

Wait, another thought—if the metric resembles that of a sphere, but with a different signature. Wait, but the metric given here is ds² = ... (dx² + dy²). So it's a Riemannian metric, not Lorentzian, because the coefficients are positive. So it's a 2D Riemannian manifold.

But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. Pseudosphere typically has a metric with a different form. Alternatively, maybe the metric given here is for a sphere, and the question is a bit misleading.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'pseudosphere' here is a mistake and it's supposed to be a sphere. Because if I think about the metric given, maybe it's a conformally flat metric. Let me think about what kind of geometry this describes.

The metric is conformally flat because it can be written as f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where f is some function. So the metric is conformally related to the Euclidean metric. The function here is 32/(4 - (x² + y²)). So f(r) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So r² must be less than 4 to avoid the denominator being zero. So the domain is x² + y² <4. That makes a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but this is a 2D metric, so the surface is a 2D surface embedded in... Wait, no—the metric describes the surface's intrinsic geometry. So what is the geometry of this 2D surface?

The area element in such a metric would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. For a conformally flat metric, the determinant is [f]^2, because the metric tensor is diag(f, f), so det(g) = f^2. Therefore, the area element would be f dx dy.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. The metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²), so g_{xx} = 32/(4 - r²) = g_{yy}, and g_{xy}=0. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2. So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy = (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

So the area would be the integral over x and y of this. But wait, the domain is x² + y² <4, because otherwise the metric blows up. So the area is the integral over the disk of radius 2 of (32/(4 - r^2)) dx dy.

Wait, but integrating that over the entire disk might give a finite or infinite result. Let's see.

Let me switch to polar coordinates. x² + y² = r². So dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the area integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ 32/(4 - r²) ] * r dr dθ

We can separate the integrals:

A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr

Hmm. Let's compute that integral. Let me let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So substituting:

∫ [32 r / u ] dr = 32 ∫ (r dr)/u = 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u = (-16) ∫ (1/u) du

The limits become from u=4 to u=0. So:

-16 ∫ (1/u) du (from 4 to 0) → -16 [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0 → -16 ( ln 0 - ln4 )

But ln 0 is negative infinity, so ln0 - ln4 is -infinity. Wait, but with the negative sign:

-16 ( (-∞) - ln4 ) → -16 ( -∞ ) → +∞. So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, but the area element is blowing up as you approach r=2. So the total area may be infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infinity. So the area would be D.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." But if the pseudosphere has finite area, what's the confusion here?

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is that the metric describes a sphere, but in a certain coordinate system that causes the area to diverge.

Wait, maybe I should consider the metric as being on a sphere of radius 2. Because in spherical coordinates, the metric is different. Or perhaps the metric given is for a sphere, but in a different coordinate system.

Wait, another approach: The metric given is similar to the metric of a sphere in some coordinates. Let's see. The standard metric for a sphere of radius a is:

ds² = a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ² )

But that's in spherical coordinates. Alternatively, another way to write the metric for a sphere is to use a conformal transformation. I remember that the unit sphere can be represented in terms of the complex plane (stereographic projection). The metric in that case would involve a function that becomes singular at a point (the north pole, perhaps).

Wait, the metric given is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me think about that. Let me factor out 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So the function is 32/(4 - r²) times the flat metric.

Wait, 32 is 4*8, but perhaps I should think about the form. Let me consider the stereographic projection of a sphere. For example, the metric on a sphere of radius a in stereographic coordinates (x,y) would be something like (4a²)/( (1 + x² + y²)^2 ) (dx² + dy²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is similar to the one for hyperbolic space.

Wait, hyperbolic space has a metric of the form f(r)^2 (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2 ), where f(r) is a hyperbolic function. But this metric here is in terms of (dx^2 + dy^2), with a conformal factor, but in 2D.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere. Let's think about the area. For a sphere of radius 2, the area would be 4π*(2)^2 =16π. But in the options, option B is 4π(x² + y²), which would depend on x and y, which doesn't make sense for the area of a sphere. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere, but with an infinite area. That can't be right because a sphere has finite area.

Wait, maybe the metric is not of a sphere but of a hyperbolic space. Because hyperbolic space has infinite area. So in 2D, hyperbolic space can be represented with a metric that's conformally flat with a factor that increases as you go outward, leading to an infinite area when integrated over all space.

In our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is finite inside x² + y² <4, and the conformal factor blows up as r approaches 2. So integrating the area element, which goes like 1/(4 - r²), would give an infinite result. So the area is infinite.

So the answer would be D) +infinity.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D Riemannian manifold. The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is related to the Euclidean metric by a scalar function \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the metric is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator becomes zero at \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \), leading to a singularity.

To compute the area of the surface described by this metric, we calculate the area element \( dA \), which is given by \( \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \), where \( g \) is the metric tensor. For a conformally flat metric, \( \det(g) = f^2 \), so the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Separating the integrals:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the limits of integration change from \( r = 0 \) (\( u = 4 \)) to \( r = 2 \) (\( u = 0 \)). The integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-du/2}{u} = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
A = 32\pi \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 32\pi \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges, and the area becomes infinite. This indicates that the surface described by the metric has an infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
