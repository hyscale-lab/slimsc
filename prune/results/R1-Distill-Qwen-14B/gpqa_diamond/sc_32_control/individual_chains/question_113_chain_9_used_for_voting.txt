Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all similar with varying degrees of unsaturation and oxygen content. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's unpack each of these one by one.

First, the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. The other two strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700; I think that might be an conjugated carbonyl, perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like an aromatic ester or something like that.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond. Or maybe more than one. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests maybe an aromatic ring, but not necessarily. Alternatively, it could be a simple double bond, like in an ester or ketone with a double bond elsewhere.

Then, the mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, the CH3CO+ ion is at m/z=45. That would come from a fragment where a ketone group is cleaved, like maybe an acetone (if it's a fragment of a larger molecule). Alternatively, maybe a methyl ester or something similar. Or maybe another structure like an ethyl group losing something else.

Now, let's look at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The degrees of unsaturation can help here. The formula is generally (2n +2 -x)/2, where x is the sum of H, X (like Cl), and subtracting from 2n +2. But since there are no X atoms, let's calculate degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2 + 2(C) - H - X + N]/2. Here, X=0 and N=0.

Option A: C6H12O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for A, 6 carbons. 2*6+2=14. H is 12. So 14-12=2. Divided by 2 gives 1. So one DoU. That could be a ring plus a double bond, but wait, one DoU is either one ring or one double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond. So if DoU is 1, it could be one double bond or one ring. But if there's a double bond, that's one DoU. So perhaps a ring plus another double bond would be two DoU. Hmm.

Wait, let me recalculate each option's DoU correctly.

Wait, another way: Each DoU is a double bond (including rings). Each ring is one, each double bond is one. Each triple bond is two.

So for each option, let's compute DoU.

Option A: C6H12O2
Hydrogens:12
So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one DoU.

So either a ring, a double bond, or a ring plus a double bond (but that would be two DoU, so no). So for one DoU, maybe a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O
DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Two DoU. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond.

Option C: C6H10O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O
DoU = (14-12)/2=1.

So, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the compound must have at least one DoU for that. So options A, B, C, D all have at least one DoU, except wait, let me check:

Wait, DoU for each:

A) 1 DoU: Could be a double bond or a ring.

B) 2 DoU: Maybe a ring and a double bond.

C) 2 DoU.

D) 1 DoU.

So the presence of vinyl hydrogens (double bond) suggests that the compound has at least one DoU, which all options except maybe B or C? No, all have at least one, but some have two.

But looking back at NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggest at least one double bond. So any option can have that.

Now, the IR: the 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. So the compound must have a carbonyl. That could be a ketone, ester, aldehyde, etc. But the FTIR also shows a peak at 1650 cm⁻¹, which is a bit lower. I think that could be a conjugated carbonyl group, possibly an aromatic ring with a carbonyl attached, like an aromatic ester or a ketone attached to an aromatic ring, but wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe an alkene nearby.

Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide, but the problem doesn't mention any amide signals. So perhaps an ester or a conjugated ketone.

The broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H. So the compound has an O-H group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and strong. But in the problem statement, the peak is described as 'very broad' and at 3000, which is consistent with an -OH group, but could it be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid?

Wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, but sometimes the peak can be strong and broad. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H is usually broader but may appear around 3300-3500, but this one is at 3000. Hmm, that's a bit lower. Maybe it's a conjugated O-H, or perhaps it's an acidic O-H, like in a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an ester. But wait, esters don't have O-H groups. So if the compound has an O-H, then it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe a phenol, but phenols have O-H around 3000 and are broad, but the presence of a conjugated carbonyl suggests maybe not a phenol.

Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl group (1700) and an O-H suggests maybe a compound with both, like a ketone and an alcohol? Or a conjugated ester with an O-H group, but that doesn't make sense because esters are O-H free.

Alternatively, the compound could be a carboxylic acid. So, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have two oxygen atoms. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2: Could be a carboxylic acid (RCOOH), but the formula would be CnH2nO2. Wait, for a carboxylic acid, the formula is CnH2nO2. Let's see: for n=6, it would be C6H12O2, which is option A. So that's possible.

But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl (around 1700) and an O-H (broad around 2500-3500, but in this case, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical for carboxylic acids, but maybe it's possible.)

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, which would have a carbonyl, but no O-H. But the IR shows an O-H, so that's unlikely.

So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C), or C6H10O (option B).

Wait, but for a carboxylic acid, it's RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for n=6, it would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: the IR also has a peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, which matches. The 1650 might be an absorption from something else, perhaps conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would make sense. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. But that's just an example.

Alternatively, the 1650 peak could be from an aromatic ring (like C=C in benzene), which has a peak around 1450-1600. So 1650 might be an aromatic ring with substituents, or maybe an conjugated carbonyl.

But considering the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that suggests perhaps an alkene somewhere. So the compound could have both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

If the compound is a dienophile or something like that, but let me think about the options.

Now, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. What's 45? Let's think of possible structures.

45 is CH3CO+ (acetone ion) or (CH3)2CO+, which is 58? No, wait, wait. Acetone is (CH3)2CO. The molecular formula is C3H6O. The molecular ion would be at m/z 58. But a fragment could lose a group. Alternatively, maybe another structure.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CHO+? No, that would be 59. Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group from an ester.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound can be determined from the options. Let's see.

If it's C6H10O2, the formula would have a molecular weight of (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

If the mass spec has a peak at 45, that suggests a fragment of 45. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, if the compound is something like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3), the molecular weight would be 112 g/mol. Breaking off the methyl group would give a fragment. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a cleavage of the carbonyl group. For example, in an ester R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could produce a fragment like R-O- and CO-R'.

Wait, but looking for 45, which is 45. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me compute the possible fragments.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. The possible fragments could be C3H5O2, which is 65 (3*12=36 +5=35 +32=68? No, wait, 3*12 +5*1 +2*16=36+5+32=73. Hmm, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a smaller part. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3, but not quite. Alternatively, perhaps a tertiary butyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: look for the molecular formula and the possible fragments.

Taking the possible options and seeing which one can produce a fragment of m/z=45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12)+(32)=72+12+32=116.

Possible fragments: Could a fragment of 45 be present? Let's see.

45 is 45. Maybe a CH3CO+ group (acetone fragment, which is (CH3)2CO+, molecular weight 58. No, wait, (CH3)2CO is 58. So a fragment of 45 would be something else.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let's calculate what that could be. 45 = 12a + 1b +16c.

Looking for integers a, b, c where 12a +b +16c =45.

Possible options:

a=2: 24 + b +16c =45 → b +16c=21. Possible c=1: b=5. So 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 oxygen. That would be C2H5O. But O is a single atom. So the formula would be C2H5O.

What's the formula C2H5O? That's an aldehyde (CH3CHO would be C2H4O, but wait, no. Wait, C2H5O could be an aldehyde with something else, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is C2H3O2. Let's see: 2*12=24, 3=3, 32=32. 24+3+32=59. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH3COO- (which would be 60 for the ion?), but not matching 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl group. For example, in the case of an ester, the cleavage could produce an acylium ion, like RCO+.

Wait, if RCO+ has a molecular weight of 45, what would R be?

RCO+ is (R)CO+. The formula would be (R)CO+.

The formula for RCO+ is (R)CO+, so for R being something like CH2CH2, maybe?

Wait, let's try RCO+ where R is CH2CH3. Then the formula would be C3H7O+. Molecular weight: 3*12 +7*1 +16 =36+7+16=59. No.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think about what could add up to 45.

Looking for 12a +1b +16c =45.

Another approach: 45 divided by 16 is about 2. So maybe two oxygen atoms? Let's see:

If c=2, then 16*2=32. 45-32=13. So 12a +b=13.

Possible a=1, then b=1. So formula is C1H1O2. Doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, c=1: 16. 45-16=29. 12a +b=29.

Looking for a and b such that 12a +b=29.

a=2: 24 +b=29 → b=5. So C2H5O. That's possible, but I'm not sure what that would be.

Alternatively, a=1: 12 +b=29 → b=17. That's not possible because maximum H for a=1 is 2*12 +17=31. But 17 H is too high for a single carbon.

Hmm. Maybe the fragment isn't an ion from a carbonyl cleavage.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ethyl group. Wait, the fragment m/z=45 could be (CH2CH2O)+? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the compound is either C6H10O2 or another option. Let's see what each option's molecular weight is.

Option A: C6H12O2: 6*12=72 +12=84 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2:72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular ion in the mass spec would be at 116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), or 100 (D). But the fragment is at 45. So 45 must be a fragment from the molecule.

Let's think about which options could have a fragment of 45. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (114), perhaps a fragment loses a (H2O?) or something else.

Wait, another approach: looking for the possibility that the molecular formula contains a fragment with molecular weight 45. So what's the fragment made of?

The fragment m/z=45. Let's think of possible functional groups. For example, a methyl group is 15, ethyl is 29, but 45 is bigger than that.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion), which is 58. No, that's too high.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think about the possible formula of the fragment. So, the formula could be C3H7O, which would be 12*3 +7 +16= 36+7+16=59. No. Alternatively, C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=61. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, in an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks off, leaving a smaller fragment.

But without knowing the structure, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, let's think about each option's possible structure, especially considering the IR and NMR data.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid, the structure could be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's a straight chain. Alternatively, it could be a cyclic structure, but that's less likely. The IR shows a carbonyl at 1700, which fits. The O-H at 3000 is a broad peak, which fits a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So perhaps it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

So for example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH.

In that case, the 1H NMR would show vinyl protons as a triplet or something else, depending on substitution. The mass spectrum would have a fragment perhaps from the cleavage at the carbonyl, like the acylium ion. But the fragment at 45 is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with an O-H group, but esters don't have O-H. So probably not.

Option C: C6H10O2. This would have a molecular weight of 114. Possible structures include esters, ketones with an ester group, or perhaps a cyclic ester. But considering the O-H in the IR, it's more likely an acid or an alcohol. But since the IR has a carbonyl, it's more likely an ester or acid.

Wait, but if it's an ester, it wouldn't have an O-H group. So maybe it's a diacid? But diacids have two O-H groups, which would show up as a very broad peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, as before.

Another thought: if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), then it would have a carbonyl group, but no O-H group. So that's unlikely because the IR shows O-H.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto acid? That would have both a carbonyl and an O-H. For example, something like CH2COOHCH2COOH, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted acetic acid with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, another clue: the IR spectrum shows a very broad peak at 3000. If it's a carboxylic acid, that peak would be broader and may encompass a larger area. But the problem states it's a very broad peak, which is consistent with an -OH group.

So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with a hydroxyl group. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec fragment again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, perhaps the fragment is a smaller part. Let's see: if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, no, that's too long. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is coming from the ester group.

Wait, the fragment at 45 could be (CH3)CO+ (45). Wait, (CH3)CO+ is 45? Let's compute: C=12, H=1, O=16. So (CH3)CO is C2H5O. Wait, no, (CH3)CO+ would be (CH3)CO+, so molecular weight is (2*12) + (5*1) +16=24+5+16=45. Oh! Wait, yes, that adds up. So (CH3)CO+ would have m/z=45. So the fragment could be (CH3)CO+.

So if the compound has a (CH3)CO group, that would produce a fragment at 45.

So which of the options have a (CH3)CO group, i.e., an acetyl group?

Looking at each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid, maybe like CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. No acetyl group, but perhaps a longer chain.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester like CH3COO(CH2)4CH2 groups or something else. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester, but no O-H there.

Wait, but if the compound is something like methyl acrylate, the formula would be C4H6O2. But our options are for C6.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl ester or something similar, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, let me think of a possible structure that includes an acetyl group. For example, if the compound is ethyl acetoacetate. The formula for ethyl acetoacetate is C5H8O3. But our options don't have O3. So that's not applicable.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a substituted acetic acid. Like CH2=CHCOOH. That would have the formula C3H4O2. But our options are for C6, so perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C is C6H10O2. The molecular formula suggests two oxygen atoms, so perhaps an ester group and another oxygen elsewhere. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl ester of a substituted propenoic acid. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH3. That would be C5H8O2. Again, not matching our options.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, but that doesn't have an O-H group.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is a beta-keto ester, but it has three oxygen atoms, which isn't in any of our options except option C has two O's. Wait, no, ethyl acetoacetate is C5H8O3, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure has two ester groups? But that would require more oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec fragment at 45 could come from a different source. Let's think about the molecular formula.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is option C, the molecular weight is 114. If the compound loses a group with molecular weight (114 -45)=69, that's possible. So the molecule could lose a 69 fragment, leaving a 45 fragment. What could a 69 fragment be? 69 is 69. Let's see:

69 = 12a +b +16c.

Looking for possible a, b, c.

a=3: 36, so 33 left for b and c. Let's see: 33= b +16c.

Possible c=2: 32, then b=1. So a=3, c=2, b=1. So C3H1O2. That's possible. So perhaps the molecule loses a C3H1O2 group, leaving a 45 fragment. But I'm not sure what that group would be.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage of the molecule into two parts. For instance, the molecule could break between two carbons, releasing a smaller fragment.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2.

Wait, let's count the formula: 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

In that structure, the ester group is OCO, so the formula fits C6H10O2.

The IR would show the ester carbonyl at around 1700 and an absorption from the double bond maybe at 1650. The O-H in the IR suggests I must have made a mistake because esters don't have O-H. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H. So the compound must have an O-H group, which esters don't. So that structure can't be correct. So the O-H must come from somewhere else.

Another thought: Maybe the compound is a diol ester? No, that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, the compound could be a geminal diol with a carbonyl group, but that's unusual.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an aromatic compound with an O-H group and a carbonyl. Like a substituted phenol with a ketone. For example, 4-hydroxyacetophenone. The structure would have a benzene ring, a hydroxyl group, and a ketone group.

So, formula would be C6H5O2. Wait, 4-hydroxyacetophenone is C7H8O2. Our options are C6, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, but considering our options, only option C is C6H10O2. Let me think about what that structure could be.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an O-H group, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, another approach: looking at the IR. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. The 1650 cm⁻¹ could be from a conjugated carbonyl group, possibly an aromatic ring. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl substituent and an O-H group.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So perhaps the aromatic ring is substituted with a carbonyl and an O-H group, and there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but benzaldehyde (PhCHO) doesn't have an O-H. But if it's PhCOOH (benzoic acid), then it would have a carbonyl and an O-H. So the IR would show a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl) and a broad peak around 3000 (O-H). But the problem states that the 1700 and 1650 peaks are both strong. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, but the ring might show C=C absorption around 1600. So 1650 might fit that.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. Benzoic acid has aromatic protons, but not vinyl (double bond) hydrogens. So that's a problem.

So perhaps the compound isn't aromatic but has a double bond. Let me think of a structure with a carbonyl group, an O-H, and a double bond.

For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOH. That would be a trans- or cis- configuration. The formula for that would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6, so perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, which would be C6H10O2. Yes, that's option C. So the formula is C6H10O2.

So, the structure would be a hexenoic acid, like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. But wait, that would be C6H10O2. Let's check the formula: 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens (from COOH). Yes, that's option C.

In this structure, the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak (1700) and a broad O-H (3000). The 1650 peak might be from the conjugation of the double bond with the carbonyl group. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (the double bond protons) as well as other protons.

The mass spectrum would show a fragment at m/z=45, which, as I thought earlier, could be from the acetyl group (CH3CO+) losing the rest of the molecule. So the fragment would come from the CH3CO part, leading to 45.

So putting it all together, the data points towards option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options provided are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis
- A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
- A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), such as in a carboxylic acid, ester, or ketone.
- A peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group or an aromatic C=C bond.

### 1H NMR Analysis
- The presence of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicates the presence of a double bond in the compound.

### Mass Spectrometry
- A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to a CH3CO+ ion, commonly observed in compounds containing an acetyl group.

### Degrees of Unsaturation
- The degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each option are calculated as follows:
  - **Option A (C6H12O2):** DoU = 1 (one double bond or one ring).
  - **Option B (C6H10O):** DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).
  - **Option C (C6H10O2):** DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).
  - **Option D (C6H12O):** DoU = 1 (one double bond or one ring).

### Key Observations and Analysis
1. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR indicates at least one double bond, ruling out structures with only a ring.
2. The IR spectrum shows a broad O-H peak and a carbonyl peak, suggesting the compound is a carboxylic acid or contains both a carbonyl and an O-H group.
3. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of an acetyl group (CH3CO+), which aligns with the molecular formula C6H10O2.

### Final Structure and Option
The compound is identified as a carboxylic acid with a double bond, such as CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. This structure has the molecular formula C6H10O2, matches all the spectroscopic data, and explains the fragment at m/z = 45 from the acetyl group.

### Conclusion
The correct chemical formula is **C6H10O2**.

Answer: C
