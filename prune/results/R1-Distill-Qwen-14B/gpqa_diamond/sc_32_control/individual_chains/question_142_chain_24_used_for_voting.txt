Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The problem gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are different vectors, so I think it's asking about where in the Bloch sphere this state is located.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh right, |0> and |1> are the standard basis states for a qubit. So, let me think: the density matrix is a statistical mixture of these two states. Because each term is (|0><0| and |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2, this is actually a completely mixed state. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state for a single qubit is at the origin, right? Because it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1>, which are orthogonal. So the density matrix would correspond to the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, what does the Bloch vector look like for this state? The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written using the Bloch vector components. The density matrix ρ can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

If the state is completely mixed, then r should be (0,0,0) because (I + 0)/2 equals the identity matrix over two, which is what we have here. Because ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which simplifies to (I)/2. So the Bloch vector is zero.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that must be the correct answer. The other options don't make sense. For example, option A is (1,1,0), which would imply a non-zero Bloch vector, so a pure state or a mixed state with some direction. But our state is completely mixed, so it's at the center.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, as it is an equal statistical mixture of the orthogonal basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the Bloch vector \(r\) of a density matrix is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\sigma\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given density matrix, it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(r = (1, 1, 0)\) corresponds to a non-zero Bloch vector, implying a pure or mixed state with a specific direction, which is incorrect for this state.
- **Option B**: \(r = (0, 0, 1)\) corresponds to a state along the \(z\)-axis, which is also incorrect.
- **Option C**: \(r = (0, 0, 0)\) correctly represents the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
- **Option D**: \(r = (1, 1, 1)\) corresponds to a non-zero Bloch vector, which is incorrect.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
