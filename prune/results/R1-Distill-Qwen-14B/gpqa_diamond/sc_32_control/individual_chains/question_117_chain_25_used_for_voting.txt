Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when compounds are chiral, right? Chiral means they have no plane of symmetry and are not superimposable on their mirror images. So, I need to check each of the given compounds to see if they have such properties.

The question lists four compounds, 1 to 4, and the options are about which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions (carboxylate groups) and 6 and 6' (nitro groups). Wait, the way the substituents are arranged might cause some symmetry. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, it won't be chiral. But if they are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe it's chiral. Let's visualize it. The biphenyl has two rings connected. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, if each ring has a carboxylate and a nitro group, but on opposite sides, maybe? Or is the arrangement such that there's a plane of symmetry? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of whether the molecule has a center of chirality or if the substituents create a chiral center. Wait, the question is about the entire molecule having optical isomerism, not necessarily a specific atom. Wait, but in this case, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, then maybe it's symmetrical. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the two substituents on each ring are in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Hmm, maybe I should come back to this one.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me write that structure. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait no, that can't be because the chain is three carbons. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is actually HOCH2CH2COOH? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so the three carbons are: COOH, CH2, CH3. So the 2nd carbon would be the middle one. So the hydroxy group would be on the middle carbon, making it HOCH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's HOCH2CH2COO- as the structure. But wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. But wait, is there a chiral center here? Because the carbon attached to the OH and the COOCH3 group would have four different substituents? Let's see. The central carbon (carbon 2) would be attached to: OH, CH3 (from the COOCH3), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's the correct structure. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? No, wait. Let's look at the structure: 

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon has an OH, two CH2 groups (left and right?), and a COOCH3 group. Wait no, the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: HO, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, that can't be right because the middle carbon would be CH2, so each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon would be CH2, meaning it's connected to two H, a CH2 group on one side, and another CH2 group on the other? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Because propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would mean a hydroxy on the second carbon. So that would make the structure CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the carbon with OH is the middle one. So the substituents on that carbon would be: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another hydrogen. Wait, that's four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that makes it a chiral center. Yes, so this compound has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

Compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is phenyl. It's a ketone with two benzene rings attached to the carbonyl group. Now, does this have any chiral centers? The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen. So the structure is O=C-(Ph)2. The central carbon has two phenyl groups, one O, and another group. Wait, wait, no. The structure is Ar-CO-Ar. So the carbonyl is double-bonded to O, and the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and one O. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is R-CO-R, where R is phenyl. So the carbonyl carbon has two phenyl groups and a double bond to O. So it's actually a trigonal planar structure. So the central carbon doesn't have four substituents, so it's not a chiral center. Also, the molecule as a whole is symmetric because both substituents are the same. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, no. Let me think. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate would be MeO2C-CH=CH-COOME. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the (E) isomer. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOMe)2? No, wait, wait. Let me correct. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. No, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So when it's esterified with methanol, both the COOH groups become COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH=CH-COOME. The double bond is between the two central carbons. So the structure is O
       ||
O-C-CH2-CH2-CO-O
No, wait, the structure is actually:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-CO-O
But no, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the two carbonyl groups are on either end of a double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl esters, so it's MeO2C-CH=CH-COOME. So the structure is MeO2C-CH2-CH2-COOME? No, wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-COOME. So the two ester groups are on either side of a double bond, in a trans configuration because it's the fumarate. Wait, but what's the configuration of the double bond in fumarate? Fumarate is the trans isomer. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. So the molecule is symmetrical because if you have two identical groups (COOCH3) on each end of the double bond, but in trans configuration. Wait, but the molecule itself. Let me imagine the structure. The two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is not symmetrical because if you have the two esters on opposite sides, there's no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane bisecting the center of the double bond. Let me think: if the two substituents (COOCH3) are trans, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because if you have two identical groups on each end, opposite each other, then there might be a plane of symmetry through the center of the double bond. But wait, if that's the case, the molecule is symmetrical, so it won't be chiral.

Wait, but then why is fumarate known for being an example of a molecule with geometric isomerism? Oh, because the substituents on either side of the double bond can rotate. Wait, but in this case, with dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same on each end. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, this is confusing. But wait, I thought that fumarate is the trans isomer, but in dimethyl fumarate, since both substituents are the same (COOCH3), is the molecule symmetrical? Let me think. If the substituents on each end are the same, like in the case of (E)-dimethyl fumarate, then the molecule is symmetrical. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, so the molecule is symmetrical through the center of the double bond. So that would mean the molecule isn't chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another thought: perhaps I'm mixing up stereoisomerism types. For a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be chiral, which requires that it doesn't have a plane of symmetry and its mirror image isn't the same as itself. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral.

So for dimethyl fumarate, because the two substituents on the double bond are the same, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So it's not chiral, hence no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait! No, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, if the substituents on either end are identical, then the molecule is symmetrical. So in that case, even though the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral.

Wait, but wait another point. If the substituents are identical and on opposite sides, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate (as the trans isomer) is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: what if the substituents are not identical? Like in maleic anhydride, but that's a different case. Wait, in our case, the substituents are the same. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, but since they're the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but some sources say that dimethyl fumarate shows cis-trans isomerism but not optical isomerism. Because the molecule is symmetrical in the trans form, so it's not chiral. So in that case, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. For a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. So in dimethyl fumarate (trans), does it have a plane of symmetry? Imagine the structure: O=C-OCH3 on one end and O=C-OCH3 on the other, connected via a double bond. If the substituents on each end are the same, and the double bond is trans, then the molecule is symmetrical. So the plane would be through the center of the double bond, reflecting each end onto the other. So yes, there's a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is often cited as having geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism. So that's correct.

So, checking all four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, I need to think about this. Biphenyl with substituents at 2,2';6,6' positions. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The question is whether this molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are in a chiral arrangement, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, the positions on each phenyl ring—let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl is linked at the 1 and 1' positions. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Let me draw this mentally. So each ring has a substituent at position 2 (carboxylate) and position 6 (nitro). Wait, but the numbering on biphenyls is such that the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring—what's their arrangement? For each ring, the substituents at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the point of attachment (position 1). Wait, if the two substituents on each ring are at para positions relative to each other, but given the biphenyl's structure, perhaps the arrangement leads to symmetry.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents on each ring are in such a way that each ring is symmetrical. But the entire molecule's symmetry depends on whether the substituents on the two rings are arranged symmetrically. Let me imagine that each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Are these positions symmetrical on each ring? Because each ring is a benzene ring, so substituents at 2 and 6 are across from each other (para), but in a way that for each ring, the substituents are symmetric. But when considering the entire molecule, which is connected at 1 and 1', the substituents on each ring may or may not create a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and the molecule is such that the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the entire molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps because the substituents are on the same side of each ring, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the axis connecting the two rings, making it symmetrical and thus achiral. Or maybe it's not symmetrical, making it chiral.

Wait, another approach: can this compound have a plane of symmetry? Let's say the plane is perpendicular to the axis connecting the two biphenyl rings. If each ring has substituents that mirror each other across that plane, then the whole molecule would be symmetrical. But if the substituents are arranged such that one is on one side and the other is on the opposite, leading to no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, the dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Now, for each ring, the substituents at 2 and 6 are across from each other. So perhaps each ring is symmetrical. Then, when connected at 1 and 1', the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: if the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, and the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, the substituents are on opposite sides, making each ring symmetrical. So the entire molecule would be symmetrical, making it not chiral. So compound 1 does not show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait—if each ring's substituents are such that they are in a symmetrical arrangement, then the molecule as a whole would be symmetrical. So then, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, let's recap:

Compound 1: Not chiral, no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Chiral (has a chiral center), so yes.

Compound 3: Not chiral, no optical isomerism.

Compound 4: Not chiral due to symmetry, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Earlier I thought it's not chiral. So, which compounds have optical isomerism?

Only compound 2. So looking back at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 — but I think 4 doesn't have it.

Option B: 3 and 4 — no, neither of them.

Option C: 2 and 3 — 3 doesn't have it.

Option D: 1 and 2 — I think 1 doesn't have it.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I thought compound 2 does have it. So which options include 2?

Option A is 1,2,4: but 4 doesn't have it.

Option D: 1 and 2. If 1 doesn't have it, and 2 does, then the correct option would be only 2. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct.

Wait, the options:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, according to my analysis, only 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated one of the compounds.

Let me re-examine compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, I think I may have been wrong about it. Let me think again. The structure is O

MeO-C-O

      ||
CH2-CH2

Wait, no, no. Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure MeO2C-CH=CH-COOME. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration). Now, if the two substituents on the double bond are the same (both COOCH3), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another possibility: perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. Because if the molecule has a plane of symmetry making it achiral, then it's a meso compound. So dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the four compounds. Only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. Looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D.

Option A: 1,2,4. But I think 1 and 4 don't have it.

Option D: 1,2. I think 1 doesn't have it.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 1. Let me re-examine.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Let me imagine the structure.

Each biphenyl ring is connected to the other at position 1. So position 1 is connected to the other ring, position 2 is next to it, and position 6 is the opposite. So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other? Or perhaps at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other? Wait, in a benzene ring, position 1 is connected to the biphenyl, so position 2 is adjacent to position 1, then position 3 is next, and so on. So position 6 would be adjacent to position 1 on the other side. Hence, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring are adjacent to the point of attachment. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other.

So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Let me visualize this: the first ring has substituents at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). The second ring has substituents at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). Now, the question is whether the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are on the same side or in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But considering that each ring's substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other, and the two rings are connected at position 1, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So, for example, the substituents on each ring could be arranged in a way that the molecule has a center of symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral and not showing optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait: the two substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring is symmetrical, but when connected as a biphenyl, the overall structure may or may not be symmetrical.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry that runs through the single bond connecting the two rings. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically across that plane, then the entire molecule is symmetrical. So, if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in positions that mirror each other across the plane, then the molecule is not chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions don't mirror each other, then the molecule could be chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard. However, assuming that the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral.

So, in that case, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D.

But in the options, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my assessment.

Wait, let me double-check compound 4. I think I may have been incorrect earlier. If dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it's not chiral. But wait, another thought: dimethyl maleate is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry. But dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, which is not a meso compound. Wait, no, wait. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans.

Wait, no, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. So dimethyl maleate is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But dimethyl fumarate is not a meso compound because the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, but since the substituents are identical, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, because in the trans configuration, the two substituents are on opposite sides, but since they're the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, whether it's cis or trans, if the substituents are the same, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. If two identical groups are on either end of a double bond in the trans configuration, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Yes, because flipping the molecule over the plane would mirror each side. So the molecule would be achiral, hence no optical isomerism.

So, going back to the four compounds:

1: Probably not chiral.

2: Yes, chiral.

3: No.

4: No.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But if 1 and 4 don't have it, then option A is incorrect. Option D includes 1 and 2, but I think 1 doesn't have it, so option D is also incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1.

Another approach: check the number of stereoisomers.

Compound 2: has a chiral center, so two enantiomers possible. So yes, optical isomerism.

Compound 4: if it's symmetrical, no.

What about compound 1?

If compound 1 has a structure where the two substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it would be chiral. For example, if on each ring, the nitro and carboxylate groups are on the same side relative to the connection point. Then, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that together create a chiral arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Let me think: if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and the connection is at 1, then if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me think of each ring: substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other (para). So each ring is symmetrical. Now, when connected at 1 and 1', the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, that would mean only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options reflect that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry and thus is chiral. How?

Wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides (trans), but they are the same, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral.

So, perhaps I'm correct that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of the other compounds.

Wait, what about compound 1? If the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it would be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face, leading to no plane of symmetry.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So, if that's the case, then compounds 1 and 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, option D would be correct (1 and 2).

But how can I be sure about compound 1?

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any diastereomers or other factors. Another approach: when two rings are connected, substituents can lead to axial chirality, as in biphenyl compounds. Axial chirality arises when the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents around the axis are not symmetrical.

Wait, in biphenyl compounds, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can exhibit axial chirality. So, for example, if on each ring, the substituents (like nitro and carboxylate) are on the same side relative to the connecting axis, the molecule could be chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Let's imagine that on each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are on the same side relative to the connecting axis. Then, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and be chiral. So, this would lead to optical isomerism.

So, in that case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, compounds 1 and 2 would have optical isomerism.

So, looking back at the options:

Option D: 1 and 2.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image. Let us evaluate each compound:

---

### Compound 1: **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
- This compound consists of two biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring (a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2).
- The arrangement of substituents can lead to axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are not symmetrical with respect to the connecting axis. For example, if the nitro and carboxylate groups on each ring are on the same side relative to the connecting axis, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is chiral.
- Based on this reasoning, **compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism**.

---

### Compound 2: **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
- The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl (CH3), a carboxylate (COOCH3), and a hydrogen (H).
- This central carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.
- **Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism**.

---

### Compound 3: **benzophenone**
- Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two identical phenyl groups.
- The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups, and the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, **compound 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### Compound 4: **dimethyl fumarate**
- Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure MeO2C-CH=CH-COOME. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.
- Since the substituents on either side of the double bond are identical, the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral.
- **Compound 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### Conclusion:
- **Compound 1**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.
- **Compound 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to a chiral center.
- **Compound 3**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (symmetrical molecule).
- **Compound 4**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (symmetrical molecule).

The correct option is **D) 1 and 2**.

Answer: D
