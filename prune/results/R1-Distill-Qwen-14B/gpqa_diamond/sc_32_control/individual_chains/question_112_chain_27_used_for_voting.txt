Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, let me break this down. First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to a combination of |up> and |down>. I should probably normalize this state first because probabilities depend on the norm.

So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To find the normalization factor, I need to compute the inner product of this with itself.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Let's compute each part:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.
(2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i -i^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Next, the operator whose matrix we're given. The operator's matrix A has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin up and down, two states), the matrix would look like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, no: because if i≠j, then Aij = hbar/2. So in a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

So, the matrix is:
A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Hmm, this looks familiar. Oh right, this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal.

So, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X. Let's think about that. The eigenstates of X are |+> and |->, where |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). But wait, no, wait: the standard eigenstates for X are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), but in this case, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of Z, so perhaps the eigenstates of X are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). But I need to confirm that.

Wait, no, the Pauli X operator is the spin-flip operator. It swaps |up> and |down>. So, its eigenstates are the superpositions where the coefficients are equal. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Right.

So, the eigenstates of operator A are these |+x> and |−x> states. But the problem says, find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So, the probabilities are the square moduli of the amplitudes of |alpha> in each eigenstate.

Wait, no, the state |alpha> is written in the Z basis, but the operator A's eigenstates are the X basis. So to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the X basis (eigenstates of A) and then the coefficients' squares will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, we can compute the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A and find the probabilities.

So, let me compute the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in the X basis.

First, let me write |alpha> after normalization:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down> ]

Now, the eigenstates of A are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me compute the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, this is:

c_+ ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) + c_- ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2) 

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down> 

This should equal |alpha>, which is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i) |down> ]

So, matching coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these two equations:

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = (1 + i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ?

Wait, wait: Let me write more carefully.

Let me denote a = c_+ and b = c_-.

Then:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

I can solve these for a and b.

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Now, adding the two equations:

2a = [ (1 +i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) 
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
=> a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7 )

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
=> b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

So, the coefficients are:

a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) 
= (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )
Simplify sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)/7, but maybe just leave it as is for now.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2
= [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) 
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / ( sqrt(14) )

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) 
= (3) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7))
So, |a|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 *7 ) = (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |b|^2:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14)
The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714...

Wait, wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 and 5/14 is approximately 0.35714. So, the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36. But looking at the options, option A gives probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value hbar/7. Let me check the average value part.

The average value of operator A is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a matrix, we can compute this as the expectation value.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues corresponding to its eigenstates, and since |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates, the expectation value would be the sum of the probabilities times the corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of A?

A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

Matrix A - λ I:

[ -λ, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -λ ]

The determinant is λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So, the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The expectation value <A> is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So,

<A> = (|a|^2)(hbar/2) + (|b|^2)(-hbar/2)
= (9/14)(hbar/2) - (5/14)(hbar/2)
= [ (9 -5)/14 ] * (hbar/2)
= (4/14) * (hbar/2)
= (2/7) * (hbar/2)
= hbar /7.

So the average value is hbar/7. Looking back at the options, option A has average hbar/7, and probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which matches our 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. Similarly, 5/14 is 0.357 which is 0.36 when rounded. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which matches.

But wait, let me double-check the probabilities I computed. |a|^2 is (9)/(14) which is approximately 0.6428, and |b|^2 is (5)/(14) ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait. Are the probabilities correctly calculated? Because the expansion coefficients were in terms of |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of A. So the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2, which are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively. So yes, 9/14 is about 0.64 and 5/14 is about 0.36.

So the options that have these probabilities and the average hbar/7 are option A.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the original state and matrix A. Let me compute that to confirm.

The expectation value <A> is given by:

⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

But since |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ], I can compute this inner product.

Wait, let me write |alpha> as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis. So, as a vector, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ].

Matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So, the expectation value is:

(1/sqrt(7)) (1+i) * [0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] 
+ (1/sqrt(7)) (2 - i) * [ (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, that's getting a bit messy, but let's compute each part.

Let me compute A * |alpha> first.

A|alpha> = [ 0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)(2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) |up> + [ (hbar/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) |down>

So,

A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) |up> + [ (hbar/2)(1+i) ] / sqrt(7) |down>

Then, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(7)) (1 -i) [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ] (for |up> component) 
+ (1/sqrt(7)) (2 + i) [ (hbar/2)(1+i) / sqrt(7) ] (for |down> component).

Wait, no, the inner product is:

⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩ = (1/sqrt(7))*(1 - i) [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ) ] 
+ (1/sqrt(7))*(2 + i) [ (hbar/2)(1 + i) / sqrt(7) ) ]

So,

= [ (1 - i)(2 - i) hbar/(2*7) ] + [ (2 + i)(1 + i) hbar/(2*7) ]

Compute each term:

First term:

(1 - i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1*(-i) -i*(2) + i^2
= 2 -i -2i - (-1) → 2 -3i +1 =3 -3i.

Wait, wait:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i + (-1) → (2 -1) -3i → 1 -3i.

Wait, wait, let me compute it again.

(1 - i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i².

i squared is -1.

So 2 -3i + (-1) = (2 -1) -3i = 1 -3i.

Wait, that's correct.

Second term:

(2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + i²
= 2 +3i -1 → (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

So, putting it all together:

⟨A⟩ = [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) ] * hbar/(2*7)
= [ 2 ] * hbar/(14)
= hbar/(7).

Which matches what I found earlier. So that's correct.

So the expectation value is hbar/7, and the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.357.

Looking back at the options:

Option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Option A looks correct.

Wait, but looking at option C: 0.28, 0.72, and hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, sqrt(7) is about 2.645, so 1/sqrt(7) is around 0.377, but our expectation value is 1/7 ≈0.142 hbar, which is hbar/7. So option A's expectation is correct.

So the correct answer would be option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, compute the norm squared:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \big[(1+i)|\text{up}⟩ + (2-i)|\text{down}⟩\big].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is the Pauli X matrix scaled by ℏ/2. Its eigenstates are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\text{up}⟩ + |\text{down}⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\text{up}⟩ - |\text{down}⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the |+x⟩, |-x⟩ basis
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, expand |α⟩ in terms of these eigenstates:
\[
|α⟩ = c_{+} |+x⟩ + c_{-} |-x⟩,
\]
where:
\[
c_{+} = \langle +x | α \rangle, \quad c_{-} = \langle -x | α \rangle.
\]
Substituting:
\[
c_{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big[(1+i) + (2-i)\big], \quad c_{-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big[(1+i) - (2-i)\big].
\]
Simplify:
\[
c_{+} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad c_{-} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute probabilities
The probabilities are the squared moduli of the coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = |c_{+}|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(-x) = |c_{-}|^2 = \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(+x) \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of A
The eigenvalues of A are ±ℏ/2. The average value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ℏ/7. This matches **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
