Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. Right, uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula: ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down. So the state |ψ⟩ is a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Wait, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, that means the state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. Because eigenvectors of P_z form the basis here. So the state's components are in the P_z basis.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can just take the inner product of the state with P_z acting on the state. Alternatively, since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

Wait, let me think. The given state is in the P_z basis. So each component of the vector corresponds to the expansion coefficient of that basis state. Since the basis states are eigenstates of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |coefficient|^2 multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So let me first write down the matrix of P_z. Oh, the matrix form of P_z is given as:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. Because the diagonal matrix elements are these values. So the basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩, corresponding to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state |ψ⟩ is a vector (a, b, c) where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is a²*(ħ) + b²*(0) + c²*(-ħ). Because each component squared gives the probability, multiplied by the eigenvalue.

Calculating each term:

a² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
b² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
c² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

Wait, that's zero. Hmm, interesting.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z² is just the square of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the matrix P_z² would have elements (ħ², 0, 0), (0,0,0), (0,0, (−ħ)^2 = ħ²). Wait no, actually, each diagonal element is (eigenvalue)^2. So P_z squared has eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0^2=0, and (-ħ)^2=ħ². So the matrix for P_z² is:

First row: (ħ², 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, ħ²)

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²).

Wait, let me compute that.

a² is 1/4, multiplied by ħ² → (1/4)ħ²
b² is 1/2, multiplied by 0 → 0
c² is 1/4, multiplied by ħ² → (1/4)ħ²

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). We already found ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, so that term is zero. So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = (ħ / sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) → Wait, sqrt(1/2) is 1/sqrt(2). So sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) is ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculations.

⟨P_z⟩: Each component's contribution is |a|^2 * ħ (for first component), |b|^2 * 0 (second), |c|^2 * (-ħ) (third). So (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩: Each component's squared eigenvalue times |coeff|^2. So first component is (ħ²)(1/4), third component is (ħ²)(1/4). Sum is 1/2 ħ². Correct.

So sqrt(1/2 ħ²) is (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty in \( P_z \), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( P_z \) (\( \langle P_z \rangle \))
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of \( P_z \), with eigenvalues \( \hbar, 0, -\hbar \). The expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating each term:
- \( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} \),
- \( \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \),
- \( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} \).

Substituting:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( P_z^2 \) (\( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \))
The eigenvalues of \( P_z^2 \) are \( \hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2 \). The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Calculating each term:
- \( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} \),
- \( \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \),
- \( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} \).

Substituting:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty in \( P_z \)
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in \( P_z \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
