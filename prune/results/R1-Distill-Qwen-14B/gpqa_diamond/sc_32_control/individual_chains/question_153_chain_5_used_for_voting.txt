Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the Michael addition reactions, and I need to determine the products of three different reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

The problem has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a reaction, and I have to find the major products. Then, I have to match them with the options given.

Let me start with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate. Malonate has two carbonyl groups, so it can act as a dienophile in some reactions, but here it's acting as a nucleophile in the Michael addition. The other compound is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, the substituents are on the beta position. So, the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Wait, no, wait. (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, no, wait: if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-p-tolyl? Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C-(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the beta position. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but the acrylate only has three carbons: CH2-CH2-COOCH3. So perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, that would be vinyl group attached to the p-tolyl, then the COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but since it's (E), the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. Wait, but the p-tolyl is a bulky group, so in the (E) configuration, the p-tolyl would be on the opposite side of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, but for the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2: C1 is CH2, C2 is C(p-tolyl), with the COOCH3 on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Then the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon, which is the C1 here, but wait, in the acrylate, the carbonyl is at C3? No, wait. Let me number the carbons: COOCH3 is on C3, so the structure is CH2-CH-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that's not right. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-p-tolyl? No, because the position is 3. Hmm, perhaps I should move on and think about the reaction.

So, dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile. It's a good enolate because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. When treated with a strong base like NaOEt, it deprotonates to form the enolate ion. The enolate has a negative charge on the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl). So the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is the acrylate.

The attack would add the enolate to the beta position, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. Then, the carbonyl would re-form, leading to a conjugated addition product.

Wait, the acrylate has the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The double bond is between the first and second carbons. The carbonyl is on the third carbon. So the beta position is the second carbon, which is part of the double bond. So when the enolate attacks the second carbon (the beta position), it'll form a new bond there. Then, the electrons from the double bond would shift to form the new carbonyl.

Wait, no, the Michael addition occurs when the enolate attacks the beta position, which is the less substituted end. Wait, but in an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, the beta position is the one next to the carbonyl. So in CH2=CH-COOR, the beta position is the CH2, not the CH. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH-COOR. The carbonyl is on the third carbon. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the alpha position is carbon 2 (next to the carbonyl), and the beta position is carbon 1. Wait, no, the alpha position is the one adjacent to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is C=O at C3. So C2 is the alpha carbon, and C1 is the beta.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=CH-COOR. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the carbonyl is on C3. So C2 is the alpha, and C1 is the beta.

So in the Michael addition, the enolate (from the malonate) will attack the beta carbon (C1) of the acrylate. So the enolate's negative charge is on C2 of the malonate. When it attacks C1 of the acrylate, it forms a new bond between C2 of the malonate and C1 of the acrylate. Then, the double bond in the acrylate breaks, and the carbonyl forms again. So the product would have a new four-carbon chain, combining the two reactants.

Wait, but let me draw it out conceptually. Malonate is (CH2COOEt)2. The enolate would be CH2COOEt- -CH2COOEt. Wait, no, actually, the enolate of dimethyl malonate is CH2COOEt-C^- -CH2COOEt, where the negative charge is on the central carbon.

Wait, no, wait. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. The deprotonation (by NaOEt) would occur at the central CH2 group, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate: the negative charge can be on either of the two adjacent carbons. So the enolate would be:

O
||
O-C-CH2-COOEt
   |
   O-CO-OEt

Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

The enolate has a negative charge on the central carbon, which can attack the beta position of the acrylate.

So, the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. The enolate from the malonate will attack the beta carbon (the CH2 group) of the acrylate.

So, when the enolate attacks, the CH2 group (beta) of the acrylate will form a bond with the malonate's central carbon. The double bond in the acrylate will break, and the carbonyl will shift, forming a new structure.

So the product would have the malonate's group attached to the acrylate's structure. Let me try to imagine the connectivity. The enolate (from malonate) attacks the CH2 of the acrylate, so the product would be: CH2(COOEt)2 attached to the acrylate's structure.

Wait, but the acrylate's structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. After the attack, the CH2 becomes connected to the malonate's carbon, and the double bond breaks. So the product would be:

CH2(COOEt)2-CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The enolate, which is a strong nucleophile, attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, which is the CH2. So the enolate (a carbanion) attacks the CH2, adding a carbon group there.

So the product would have the malonate's group attached to the CH2, which is now bonded to the central carbon of the enolate. So after the addition, the structure would be:

(CH2(COOEt)2)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt.

But wait, that doesn't seem correct because the carbonyl would shift. Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a conjugated system. Let me think about the possible structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a tetramer? No, that's not right. Let me think differently. When the enolate adds to the acrylate, the product would have the two carbonyl groups (from the malonate) and the p-tolyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the product as a trimethyl ester. Wait, the options for A are either trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate or trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

Wait, the product would have three ester groups. So the initial enolate (from dimethyl malonate) has two ester groups, and the acrylate has one. So after the attack, perhaps the product has three ester groups.

Wait, maybe the product is formed by adding the malonate's enolate to the acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. The enolate is CH2COOEt-C- (attacking) CH2COOEt. When the attack happens, the CH2 from the acrylate gets linked to the central carbon of the enolate.

So the product would have the structure CH2(COOEt)2 attached to the CH2 that was part of the acrylate. Wait, but the acrylate's structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the attack would form a new bond between the central carbon of the enolate and the CH2 of the acrylate.

So the product would be CH2(COOEt)2-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOEt. Wait, that's four carbons in a row. But wait, the enolate has two esters, and the acrylate contributes another ester. So the product would have three ester groups: two from the malonate and one from the acrylate.

Hmm, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Let me see: the structure would be:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
   |
   C
  / \
O-CO-OCH3   O-CO-OCH3
   |
CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-...

Wait, perhaps it's a longer chain. Alternatively, I'm not entirely sure, but looking at the options, option A and B for part A are trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Option C and D for A are trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

Wait, so the numbering might be important here. Let's think: after the Michael addition, the structure would have the p-tolyl group attached to a carbon that's adjacent to a carbonyl. In the product, the p-tolyl would be on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me move to the second reaction and see if that helps.

Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + MeOH, H3O+ â†’ (B)

Hmm, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a compound where a cyclohexene ring is attached to a piperidine. The cyclohexene is in position 1, so it's a substituted cyclohexene connected to the piperidine. The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CHCH2CN, but in the (E) configuration. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CHCN, but no, wait: but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Or CH2CH2CN with a double bond at position 2. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN, but the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN, but in the (E) configuration, which would have the CN group on one side and the CH2 on the other.

Wait, but wait: but-2-enenitrile is CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, that can't be right because butenitrile is four carbons, so but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the nitrile group? No, nitrile is at the end, so the positions are numbered from the nitrile end. So perhaps but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the nitrile is on C4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2=CHCH2CN. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the nitrile is on C4. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN, and the (E) configuration would have the higher priority groups (like CH2CN and CH2) on opposite sides.

Now, the reaction is under MeOH and H3O+ (acidic conditions). So the conditions might be for a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but the Michael addition typically uses a base. Hmm, but perhaps in this case, it's a different type of addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) but under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the first part of the reaction, the Michael donor, is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Wait, no, wait: the Michael addition has a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. But here, the nucleophile is piperidine with a cyclohexene substituent. So perhaps the piperidine is acting as a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is part of the conjugated system, making it the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine is providing the nucleophile.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: the Michael reaction is when a nucleophile (enolate) attacks an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor). So in this reaction, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine compound is providing the nucleophile.

Wait, but nitriles are not typically Michael acceptors. Michael acceptors are usually alpha-beta unsaturated esters, ketones, etc. So perhaps the nitrile is acting differently here. Alternatively, maybe under acidic conditions, the nitrile can undergo some change.

Wait, but the reaction is between 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The conditions are MeOH and H3O+ â€” so it's an acidic environment. What's the possible reaction here?

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is acting as a nucleophile. But cyclohexene isn't typically a strong nucleophile. Alternatively, the piperidine ring might be acting as a base, deprotonating something. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the piperidine is a nucleophile, attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile.

Wait, but nitriles aren't as good as carbonyl groups for Michael acceptors. So maybe this is a different type of addition. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene is acting as a conjugated diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, but but-2-enenitrile is a dienophile. But under acidic conditions, I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, maybe the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitrile. But nitriles are not very acidic. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is attacking the alpha position of the nitrile, which is conjugated. Let me think: the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. The alpha position is the CH2 group next to the double bond.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, maybe the CH2 group becomes protonated, making the adjacent carbon more electrophilic. Then, the piperidine (which is a cyclic amine) could act as a nucleophile, attacking the alpha position, leading to a conjugate addition.

Wait, but the Michael addition typically uses a base to deprotonate the nucleophile. In this case, the conditions are acidic, so maybe the reaction isn't a Michael addition but something else, like a conjugate addition under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is a good nucleophile even under acidic conditions. Let's think about the structure.

The piperidine has a cyclohexene ring attached to it. The cyclohexene is at position 1, so it's a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 1, attached to the piperidine's nitrogen.

So the piperidine is probably acting as a nucleophile here, attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. So the nitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine is the nucleophile (perhaps as an enamine or some conjugate base?).

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is part of the conjugated system, making the alpha position more electrophilic. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a base and deprotonates the alpha position of the nitrile, making it a better nucleophile, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the product after the reaction is given as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile in option A, and 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile in other options.

Looking at the product, perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene ring is reacting with the nitrile. So the piperidine's cyclohexene is a conjugated diene, and the but-2-enenitrile is a dienophile, leading to a Diels-Alder reaction. But under acidic conditions, the Diels-Alder might not occur. Alternatively, maybe it's a [4+2] cycloaddition, forming a six-membered ring.

Wait, but the product in option A is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So that suggests that the product has a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (oxo) group at position 2, attached to a butanenitrile group at position 3.

Hmm, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is undergoing a conjugate addition to the nitrile. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the nitrile as a dienophile. Let's think: the dienophile would be the (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and the diene would be the cyclohexene ring. But wait, the cyclohexene is part of the piperidine, so maybe the structure is such that the piperidine's ring is connected to the cyclohexene, allowing for a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the cyclohexene is already a conjugated diene. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product structure. 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile would have a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C2 and a butanenitrile group attached at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new ring. So the piperidine might be opening up to form a new ring with the nitrile.

Wait, perhaps the piperidine's nitrogen is attacking the alpha position of the nitrile, leading to the formation of a new bond. Then, the cyclohexene ring would open or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's ring is not involved, and the cyclohexene is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder with the nitrile as a dienophile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the piperidine's amine to the nitrile. But nitriles are not as reactive as carbonyls for such additions. So perhaps this is a different type of reaction, like an acid-catalyzed enamine formation, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on part B. Let me try to think about part C, which is given as:

C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O â†’ 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2, which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2, but wait, but-3-en-2-one would have the structure CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. So it's CH2=C-O-CO-CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-CO-CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=C(O)CH2CH3. Wait, but butenone is typically but-2-enone, which is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. So perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that's not possible because but has four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=C(O)CH2CH3? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3-C(O)-CH=CH2. No, that's but-2-en-1-one, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

So the reaction is between C and but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O, giving 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So the product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketones at positions 1 and 3. The substituent at position 2 is a 3-oxobutyl group, which is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3? Or maybe CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-C(O)-something.

Wait, the substituent is 3-oxobutyl, which is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-? Or perhaps it's CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-C(O)-something? I'm not sure.

Wait, 3-oxobutyl would be CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it's CH2-CH(O)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 2.

Hmm, but how does this come from the reaction between C and but-3-en-2-one under KOH and H2O?

Wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

When KOH is present, perhaps it's a base, deprotonating the alpha position of the enone. Then, the enolate would form and attack the carbonyl of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C).

Wait, but wait: the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane-1,3-dione is C, and the but-3-en-2-one would be the Michael acceptor, providing the 3-oxobutyl group.

Wait, but the Michael addition requires a nucleophile and an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So perhaps C is the nucleophile, and but-3-en-2-one is the Michael acceptor.

Wait, but C is reacting with but-3-en-2-one. The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent. So perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3-dione is the nucleophile, acting as the enolate, and but-3-en-2-one is the Michael acceptor.

But but-3-en-2-one has a double bond between C3 and C4 (assuming it's but-3-en-2-one: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3, but that would require a double bond between C3 and C4, which in but is four carbons, so that's possible.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one would be CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that would make the structure CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one would have the double bond between C3 and C4 in a four-carbon chain, which would mean the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's not possible because but has only four carbons. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3, but that would mean the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the carbonyl is on C2. That makes more sense.

So, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3.

So in this case, the enolate of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C) would attack the beta position of the but-3-en-2-one. The beta position is the CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

So the enolate attacks the CH2 group, leading to the formation of a new bond. The product would then have the cyclohexane ring attached to the butyl group, with the ketone from the butenone.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

So after the Michael addition, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione would have a butyl group attached, where the butyl has a ketone at position 3.

So the product would be formed by the enolate of C (cyclohexane-1,3-dione) attacking the beta position of but-3-en-2-one, leading to the addition of the butyl group with the ketone.

So the product would have the structure where the cyclohexane-1,3-dione is connected to a CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3 group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Now, looking at the options, the product C is either 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, cyclohexane-1,3-dione, or something else.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening or a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, considering the presence of KOH and H2O, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the enolate from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the but-3-en-2-one, leading to the product.

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group. So the butyl chain has a ketone at position 3, which comes from the but-3-en-2-one.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the Michael addition leads to the cyclohexane ring being attached to a butyl group that has a ketone at position 3.

Putting it all together, the product would then be 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which matches the given product.

Now, looking at the options, the third part (C) in option B is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which doesn't match. Option D's C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which also doesn't match. Option A's C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. Option C's C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Hmm, but the product of C is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which isn't directly listed in the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the options are referring to the starting material C as the product.

Wait, the question says:

C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione

So C is a reactant, and the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, the options for part C are:

A) C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

B) C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

C) C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

D) C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which isn't listed as one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, no, the options are for the products A, B, and C. Wait, the options are for each of the three reactions. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the question is: What are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?

So for each of the three reactions (A, B, C), what is the product. The options list A, B, and C as possible products.

Wait, in the first part, the reaction is A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate â†’ product A.

In the second part, reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile â†’ product B.

In the third part, reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one â†’ product given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So in the options, the choices are options A, B, C, D, each giving the products A, B, and C.

For example, option A says:

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But the product of reaction C is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is not listed in the options for C (they list options for product C as either 2-hydroxy... or cyclohexane-1,3-dione).

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood. So in reaction C, the reactant is C, and the product is the given structure. So C is the starting material in that reaction.

Wait, the question is a bit confusingly written. Let me read it again.

The question says:

What are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)

Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + MeOH, H3O+ â†’ (B)

Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O â†’ 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione

So for reaction C, C is a reactant, and the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So what is C?

Looking at the options, in each option, C is either 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione or cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So reaction C is: C (reactant) + but-3-en-2-one â†’ product.

So for reaction C, the product is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so what is the starting material C?

Wait, perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Then, the reaction adds the butyl group to it, forming the product.

Alternatively, perhaps C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which under basic conditions loses water to form a double bond, making it a Michael acceptor, which then reacts with but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are KOH and H2O, which implies it's a basic aqueous solution.

Wait, perhaps in reaction C, C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, and under basic conditions, the hydroxyl group is deprotonated, forming an enolate. The enolate then attacks the but-3-en-2-one, leading to the product 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the starting material C would be 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which in the presence of KOH forms an enolate. The enolate attacks the butenone, leading to the product.

If that's the case, then in the options, option A and D have C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, while B and C have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which suggests that the starting material C must have a hydroxyl group at position 2, which upon deprotonation forms the enolate that attacks the butenone.

So, in the options, for reaction C, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So if C is 2-hydroxy..., then the product would have the substituent added.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione â†’ product would be as desired.

Option D: C = 2-hydroxy..., same as A.

So, now, let me go back to the first reaction.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate â†’ product A.

As I thought earlier, the product would be a trimethyl ester with three COOEt groups. The options for A are trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate or 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

The numbering in the product name is important. So for trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, the structure would be:

CH2(COOEt)-C(p-tolyl)-(COOEt)2.

Wait, no, the structure would be O
            |
COOEt - C - C - COOEt
            |
            CH2

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a four-carbon chain with three ester groups. So:

COOEt - CH2 - C(p-tolyl) - CH2 - COOEt

But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a three-carbon chain with ester groups on carbons 1, 1, and 3. That would be:

COOEt
|
C - C(p-tolyl) - COOEt
|
COOEt

Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is:

COOEt - C - CH2 - COOEt
   |
   C(p-tolyl)

But I'm not confident. The product names in the options suggest that for A, the product is either 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate or 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

So for 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, the structure would have the p-tolyl group on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, with ester groups on carbons 1,1, and 3.

So:

Carbons: 1, 2, 3.

Carbon 1: two ester groups (since it's 1,1,3 tricarboxylate).

Carbon 2: p-tolyl group.

Carbon 3: one ester group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
   |
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH(COOOCH3)2

Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, the structure would be:

COOEt
|
C-O-C
|
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOEt

Hmm, perhaps it's better to move on.

So, for reaction A, the product is either option A or B in the product options.

Now, putting it all together.

Looking at the options:

Option A:
A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,
B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,
C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B:
A = same as A,
B = same as A,
C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C:
A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate,
B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile,
C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D:
Same as C for A and B,
C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

From earlier analysis:

Reaction A's product is either option A or B's A, which are trimethyl ... tricarboxylate.

Reaction B's product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (option A) or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (options C and D).

Reaction C's product is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the starting material C must be 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which under KOH, forms the enolate that attacks the butenone.

So looking at options, for reaction C, only options A and D have C as 2-hydroxy... So the correct option for C must be either A or D.

Now, for reaction B, the product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (option A) or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (options C and D).

If the reaction B is a Michael addition where the piperidine's enolate attacks the butenitrile, then the product would have a nitrile group attached to a cyclohexyl group. But nitriles are not typical Michael acceptors, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene ring is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the butenitrile as a dienophile. The product would then be a six-membered ring with substituents from both reactants.

Wait, but butenitrile is a dienophile, and cyclohexene is a diene. So in a Diels-Alder reaction, the butenitrile (dienophile) would react with the cyclohexene (dienophile?), but I'm not sure about the regiochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the amine attacks the alpha position, leading to a new bond.

Hmm, I'm stuck on reaction B. Let me try to think differently.

The product for reaction B is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

In option A, B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would mean the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 2 and is attached to the butanenitrile at position 3.

In option C and D, B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. That suggests a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at position 2, attached to butanenitrile at position 3.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the piperidine's nitrogen attacks the alpha position of the nitrile. Then, the cyclohexene ring would form, leading to the product with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic. So perhaps the piperidine acts as a nucleophile under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's ring opens upon reaction with the nitrile, leading to the formation of a new ring.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me consider the options and see which ones fit.

If I consider option A:

A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

In reaction C, the starting material is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which under KOH forms an enolate that adds to but-3-en-2-one, giving the product 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

That makes sense. So option A's C would be correct.

For reaction A, the product would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That implies that the p-tolyl group is on carbon 2 of a three-carbon chain, with ester groups on carbons 1,1, and 3.

So, the structure would be:

COOEt
|
C - C(p-tolyl) - COOEt
|
COOEt

But that's a three-carbon chain? No, because the central carbon is connected to two ester groups and the p-tolyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOEt-O-C-CH2-COOEt

No, not quite. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OEt
   |
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH(COOEt)2

Hmm, perhaps that's the case.

So, in reaction A, the product would have the p-tolyl group on the central carbon, with ester groups on both sides.

So option A's A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

I think I've convinced myself that option A is correct for reaction A.

For reaction B, option A's product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

The reaction is between 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. So, perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene ring is involved in a Diels-Alder reaction with the butenitrile as the dienophile. The product would then have a six-membered ring with a nitrile substituent.

But I'm not certain, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the product for B in option A is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That suggests that the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 2 and is attached to the butanenitrile group at position 3.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone in the ring, indicating that an elimination or oxidation has occurred. But under the given conditions (MeOH and H3O+), I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring undergoes a conjugate addition with the nitrile, leading to a ring expansion or contraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's amine attacks the nitrile's alpha position, leading to the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and then the cyclohexene ring opens to form a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps under acidic conditions, the piperidine is protonated, making it a better nucleophile. Then, the nitrile's alpha position is attacked, leading to a ring formation.

But I'm not confident. Considering the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the most consistent option.

Looking at the options, option A's products are:

A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate,

B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile,

C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Which seems consistent with the analysis for reaction C. So I'll go with option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the products of three Michael addition reactions. Each reaction is analyzed as follows:

### Reaction A: Dimethyl Malonate + Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)
- **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile (enolate), and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor.
- **Mechanism**: The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the Î²-carbon of the acrylate, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a trimethyl ester with three carboxylate groups, where the p-tolyl group is attached to the second carbon of a three-carbon chain.
- **Product**: The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.

### Reaction B: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + MeOH, H3O+ â†’ (B)
- **Reactants**: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine provides the nucleophile, and (E)-but-2-enenitrile acts as the Michael acceptor.
- **Mechanism**: The reaction likely involves a conjugate addition where the nucleophile attacks the Î²-carbon of the nitrile. The product contains a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 2 and a butanenitrile group attached at position 3.
- **Product**: The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.

### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O â†’ 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
- **Reactants**: The starting material C is identified as **2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione**. Under basic conditions (KOH, H2O), the hydroxyl group is deprotonated to form an enolate.
- **Mechanism**: The enolate attacks the Î²-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a 3-oxobutyl group attached at position 2.
- **Product**: The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, confirming that C is **2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione**.
