Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. So any operator added to SMEFT must maintain the symmetries of the SM.

But wait, the SM includes specific symmetries. The SM has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the SM has Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT must preserve that as well, right? Because all the operators are built from SM fields.

Wait, but what about Poincare symmetry? Since the SM already respects Poincare, any operators in SMEFT should also respect it. Because if they didn't, the theory wouldn't be consistent—it would violate the symmetries that the SM already maintains.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetry? The SM doesn't have a CP symmetry, right? Well, actually, the SM has approximate CP symmetry, but it's not exact. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD has some CP violation. So, SMEFT operators could, in principle, violate CP, depending on the new physics. But wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, no. SMEFT as an effective theory typically assumes that the high-energy physics respects certain symmetries. Or wait, no, the effective theory includes all possible operators that are allowed by the SM gauge symmetry. So, the SM includes CPT symmetry. Wait, no, the SM doesn't have exact CPT symmetry. Or does it?

Wait, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and all Lorentz-invariant theories are expected to have CPT symmetry. Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the actions are the same under CPT transformations. So, SMEFT has to respect CPT symmetry because it's Lorentz-invariant.

What about CP symmetry? The SM doesn't respect CP exactly because of the CKM mechanism. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning that the theory doesn't have to preserve CP. So if all operators must respect a symmetry, then CP isn't one of them.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must be compatible with Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry (since it's built from SM fields which have that), and CPT symmetry. But not necessarily CP symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect Lorentz symmetry. And since it's part of the SM, which is also Poincare-invariant, SMEFT must respect that as well.

CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. In the SM, CPT is a symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must also respect CPT. Because if it didn't, that would mean the effective theory breaks CPT, which wouldn't make sense since it's an effective theory of the SM.

Wait, but wait—what about parity (P)? The SM doesn't have parity symmetry. For example, the weak interaction violates parity. So SM operators can change parity. So SMEFT operators can have various parities. But CPT is a symmetry, so operators must respect that. So, any operator must respect CPT, but not necessarily any of its subgroups like C, P, or T individually.

So, putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz symmetry: Yes, because SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant.

2. Poincare symmetry: Yes, because it includes Lorentz and translations, and the SM has that.

3. CP symmetry: No, because SM doesn't have it, and SMEFT can have operators that violate CP.

4. CPT symmetry: Yes, because the SM respects it, so SMEFT must as well.

So looking back at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

The options are:

A) 1,2 → so Lorentz and Poincare. But what about CPT? Because CPT is separate from Poincare.

Wait, Poincare symmetry is about spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations. CPT is a separate symmetry. So the answer includes 1,2,4.

So the correct answer is C) 1,2,4.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) and their implications for SMEFT:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT, being an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT are constructed from SM fields and interactions, which inherently preserve Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT, as an effective theory of the SM, must also preserve this symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry exactly (e.g., due to CP violation in the CKM mechanism). Consequently, SMEFT operators can violate CP symmetry, meaning CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, it must also respect CPT symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any Lorentz-invariant theory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
