Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator along a certain direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem says the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like position or momentum have eigenvectors corresponding to their eigenstates.

Wait, the components of P are given. Px, Py, Pz. Each is ħ/2 multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. So, let me write down what each component looks like.

Px is ħ/2 times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is ħ/2 times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is ħ/2 times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

But wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n could be any direction in the x-z plane, meaning it's of the form (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Right, because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to θ measured from the z-axis.

So the operator P is a vector operator, which probably is the sum of its components multiplied by the direction vector. So the operator along n would be P · n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But wait, since n lies in x-z, n_y is zero. So P_y component doesn't contribute. So the operator is just P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Wait, no. Because n is a unit vector. Let me think: n = (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. So n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Therefore, the operator P along n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Because P is a vector operator, and the direction is n, so it's their dot product.

But each P component is ħ/2 times their respective matrices. So let me write that operator:

P_n = (n_x * (ħ/2) * X_matrix) + (n_z * (ħ/2) * Z_matrix )

Simplify that:

P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x X + n_z Z )

Where X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the matrix form of P_n is (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ].

Wait, let me compute that. The X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by n_x, becomes [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]]. The Z matrix is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z ] ] multiplied by 1 (since it's n_z * Z, but Z is multiplied by ħ/2 elsewhere).

So when you add them: X part is [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]], and Z part is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]. Adding together, gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ]]. Then multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix form is (ħ/2) multiplied by:

[ n_z   n_x ]
[ n_x  -n_z ]

Now, the eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenstate |ψ> such that P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the equation becomes:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Which gives two equations:

1) (n_z -1)a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Wait, maybe I should write them as:

From the first equation:
n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

From the second equation:
n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

So we have the system:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

This is a homogeneous system; for non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero.

Alternatively, we can solve it using substitution. Let's take the first equation: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Wait, but substituting into the second equation might lead us somewhere.

Let me substitute a from the first equation into the second.

From first equation: a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Second equation: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Substitute a:

n_x [ -n_x/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Multiply out:

[ -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ] b + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Factor out b:

b [ -n_x^2/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0.

Assuming b is not zero (since we're looking for non-trivial solutions), the term in brackets must be zero.

So:

- n_x²/(n_z -1 ) - (n_z + 1) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 - (n_z + 1)(n_z -1) = 0.

But note that n_x² + n_z² =1 because n is a unit vector.

Wait, n is (n_x, 0, n_z), so (n_x)^2 + (n_z)^2 =1.

So, let's compute the term:

- n_x² - [ (n_z)^2 -1 ] =0.

Because (n_z +1)(n_z -1)=n_z² -1.

So,

- n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) =0 → -n_x² -n_z² +1 = 0.

But n_x² +n_z² =1, so this becomes - (1) +1 = 0 → 0=0.

Which is always true. So this system doesn't give us any new constraints beyond the fact that the vectors are in the x-z plane.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. The eigenvalues of the matrix [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] can be found, and since we know the eigenvalue is 1 (since the eigenvalue equation is (matrix) * vector = eigenvalue * vector, with eigenvalue 1 after dividing by (ħ/2)), let's compute the eigenvalues.

The matrix is:

[ n_z   n_x ]
[ n_x  -n_z ]

The trace is n_z - n_z =0. The determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x)^2 = -n_z² -n_x² = -(n_x² +n_z²)= -1, because n_x² +n_z² =1.

The eigenvalues λ are solutions to λ^2 - tr λ + det =0 → λ^2 -0 λ -1=0 → λ^2 =1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Which makes sense because the matrix is Hermitian, as it should be for an observable.

So the eigenvector we’re looking for is the one with eigenvalue +1.

So to find the eigenvector, we can solve the equation:

[ n_z   n_x ] [a]   = 1 [a]
[ n_x  -n_z ] [b]      [b]

Which gives the same two equations as before:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a +n_x b =0.

n_x a -n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

Let me write these as:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

Equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

Wait, that's substituting a from equation 2. Wait, from equation 2:

n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = (n_z +1)/n_x * b.

But from equation 1: a = (-n_x)/(n_z -1) * b.

So set them equal:

(n_z +1)/n_x * b = (-n_x)/(n_z -1) * b.

Since b is non-zero, we can divide both sides by b:

(n_z +1)/n_x = -n_x/(n_z -1)

Multiply both sides by n_x (n_z -1):

(n_z +1)(n_z -1) = -n_x^2.

But (n_z +1)(n_z -1) is n_z² -1.

So,

n_z² -1 = -n_x².

But since n_x² +n_z² =1, substituting:

n_z² -1 = -(1 - n_z²) → n_z² -1 = -1 +n_z² → 0=0.

Again, this is always true, so it doesn't give any new info.

Hmm, perhaps I can parametrize the eigenvector in terms of theta. Remember that the direction is in the x-z plane, so let me set n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, wait. No, because in standard spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So the unit vector in the x-z plane would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but here it's a 2D problem, so perhaps for the spin-1/2 system, the state is represented in the x-z plane, so the angle is θ as the angle from z.

Wait, perhaps using the Bloch sphere representation. The eigenstates of a spin-1/2 operator along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) are |+> and |->, which can be written as:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |1>

|-> = -i sin(θ/2) |0> + e^{iφ} cos(θ/2) |1>

But in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so φ=0 or π? Wait, for the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π since y component is zero. So perhaps φ=0.

Wait, but for the problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is 0 or π.

But when φ=0, the eigenstates would have real coefficients, because e^{i0}=1. Let me think.

So for the |+> state along the direction (n_x, 0, n_z), the eigenstate would be:

cos(θ/2) |0> + sin(θ/2) |1> ?

Wait, or is it sin(theta/2) in the first term?

Wait, no, the standard form is |+> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>.

So in our case, since φ=0 (because the direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π), for simplicity, let's take φ=0.

So the state becomes |+> = cos(θ/2)|0> + sin(θ/2)|1>.

But wait, the eigenvector we're seeking is the one for eigenvalue +ħ/2, which corresponds to the |+> state. So the normalized eigenvector should be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. But wait, option D is sqrt(2/3)ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3)ħ sin(theta/2), but that includes hbar. Wait, the eigenvector elements are just the coefficients, not multiplied by ħ.

Wait, the options are giving the elements of the eigenvector. So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me double-check. The eigenvectors are determined by the direction. The operator is along (n_x, 0, n_z), so theta is the angle from the z-axis. So the state should be cos(theta/2)|0> + sin(theta/2)|1>.

So the components would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the question is about the normalized eigenvector. So the state I wrote is already normalized, because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

But let me check the other options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). That looks like the spherical harmonics, but perhaps for a different scenario. Not sure.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which would come from specific theta values, perhaps, but the question is general.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector would depend on theta, which is the angle that defines the direction. So option C is correct because it's expressed in terms of theta/2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the possible eigenvectors again.

From the matrix approach, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 is [a; b] such that (n_z -1)a +n_x b=0.

Let me write a in terms of b.

a = [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b.

But since n_z = cos(theta), because n is in x-z, and theta is the angle from z, then 1 - n_z = 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2).

And n_x = sin(theta).

So a = [ sin(theta) / (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ] b.

But sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b.

Simplify: a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Let me pick b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] which is option C.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, the denominator in a's expression is (1 - n_z) which is 2 sin^2(theta/2). So another approach: let me set b = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2) ) ), but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, since the eigenvector is only determined up to a scalar multiple, I can let b=1, then a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)].

But perhaps another parametrization would help. Let me think: the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 is along the direction of the operator, which is (n_x, 0, n_z). So the spin-up state would be a linear combination of |0> and |1> with coefficients determined by theta.

Wait, in the Bloch sphere, the spin-up state along the direction (n_x, 0, n_z) is indeed cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>. Since in our case, phi=0, it becomes cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2)|1>.

Which matches option C. So the correct answer must be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator along $\vec{n}$**:  
   The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
   \[
   P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
   \]
   where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $P_n$ becomes:
   \[
   P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   P_n | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
   \]
   where $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting $P_n$, we get:
   \[
   \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving the Eigenvalue Problem**:  
   The eigenvalues of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}$ are $\pm 1$, as it is a Hermitian matrix. For the eigenvalue $+1$, the eigenvector satisfies:
   \[
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   Solving these equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This does not match the general form of the eigenvector derived above, as it introduces specific coefficients dependent on $\theta$ that are not justified by the problem.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This form is inconsistent with the derived eigenvector, as it does not match the $\theta/2$ dependence in the coefficients.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is normalized.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This introduces unnecessary scaling factors that are not present in the general solution.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.
