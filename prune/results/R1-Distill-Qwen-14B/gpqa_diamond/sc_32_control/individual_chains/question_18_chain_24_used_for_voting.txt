Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. They've used the Equivalent Width (EW) method and LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) to determine their elemental abundances.

The given data is [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) ?

Wait, I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then use that to find the ratio. Because the ratio of silicon in each star compared to the Sun's will give me the needed ratio between the two stars.

Let me recall that the element abundance notation [X/Y] is defined as log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). Which can be rewritten as (n_X/n_Y) = 10^([X/Y]) * (n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, actually, the general formula is [X/Y] = log (n_X / n_Y) - log (n_X,sun / n_Y,sun) ) = log( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X,sun / n_Y,sun) ). So, 10^{[X/Y]} = (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X,sun / n_Y,sun). So, (n_X / n_Y) = 10^{[X/Y]} * (n_X,sun / n_Y,sun).

So, for each star, I can find [Si/H] and then compute n_Si/n_H for each, and then take the ratio.

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, [Fe/H]=0 means that the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun. So, [Fe/H]_1 = log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )=0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1 / (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun)) ) =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Wait, but the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Wait, but that's the same as the Sun's.

Wait, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. So, same as the Sun.

But what about [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3? So,

[Si/Fe]_1 = log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) ) =0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But since n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun * n_H1) / n_H_sun.

Wait, maybe it's better to express n_Si1 in terms of n_Si_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Given that for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But n_Fe1 is (n_Fe_sun * n_H1 ) / n_H_sun.

Wait, but the ratio n_Si1/n_H1 can be found as:

n_Si1 = [ (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 ] * n_Fe1.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

So, substituting:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) *10^0.3 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1.

Simplify:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_H1.

So, n_Si1 / n_H1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^0.3.

Which is equivalent to [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun + 0.3.

Because [Si/H] = log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = log( (n_Si/n_H)/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

So, 10^{[Si/H]_1} = (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) → which is 10^{[Si/H]_sun +0.3} = 10^{[Si/H]_sun} *10^{0.3}.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

What's [Si/H]_sun? The Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, but that's for Fe. We need [Si/H].

The sun's photosphere: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about Si? I don't have [Si/H]_sun directly. Wait, perhaps I can find it using the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] isn't given, but we can compute it. Because [X/Y] is log(n_X /n_Y) - log(n_X_sun /n_Y_sun).

Wait, for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) )=0. So, [X/Y]_sun is zero.

Wait, no, actually, [X/Y] is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the element's abundance in the star compared to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log( (n_X /n_Y)_star / (n_X /n_Y)_sun )

So, for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun =0.

Therefore, in the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun =0.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 means that Si is 0.3 dex more abundant relative to Fe than the Sun. Which would make Si more abundant.

But wait, how does that relate to [Si/H]?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_1.

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

We also have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) =0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

So, n_Si1 = (10^0.3) * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun *n_H1) / n_H_sun.

Substituting, n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun *n_H1)/n_H_sun.

Simplify: 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun *n_H1)/n_H_sun.

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Which is 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun).

Which means [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

Because [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) = log( (n_Si/n_H)/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = log( (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = log( 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = log(10^0.3) )=0.3. So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

But wait, what is [Si/H]_sun?

Let me calculate that. The Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, so [Si/Fe]_sun =0. But that doesn't give me [Si/H]_sun directly.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun using the given data.

Wait, the problem gives the Sun's 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

But what about Si? I don't have that number directly. Oh wait, perhaps I can get it via the [Mg/Si]_2 given. Wait, no, because that's for Star_2.

Hmm. Maybe I can relate [Mg/Si]_2 to find [Si/H]_2, but perhaps I should first find [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the Sun's [Si/H].

We don't have a direct value, but perhaps we can compute it using the [Fe/H]_sun and [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun is zero because n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] for the Sun is defined as log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )=0.

So, no, that doesn't help. Hmm. Maybe I need to assume that [Si/H]_sun is zero? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the Sun's [Si/H].

We have for the Sun:

log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^-4.5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about Si? I don't have that. Wait, perhaps the solar [Si/Fe] is zero. So, [Si/Fe]_sun =0 → log( (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ))=0 → yes, that's always true.

But that doesn't give me the value of n_Si_sun/n_H_sun.

Hmm. Maybe I can think in terms of number densities. Let me assign variables.

Let me denote for the Sun:

n_Fe_sun = F, n_H_sun = H.

Similarly, n_Si_sun = S, n_Mg_sun = M.

Given:

12 + log10(F/H) =7.5 → log10(F/H) = -4.5 → F= H * 1e-4.5.

12 + log10(M/H) =7 → log10(M/H)= -5 → M= H * 1e-5.

But I don't have S. Wait, perhaps I can find it using the [Mg/Si]_2 value.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 =0.

Wait, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

So, substituting n_Mg2:

( (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2 ) / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Simplify:

n_H2 / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_H_sun /n_Si_sun ) * (n_Mg_sun /n_Mg_sun) ) → n_H2 / n_Si2 = 10^0.3 * (n_H_sun / n_Si_sun).

So, n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) / 10^0.3.

Which can be written as [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

But wait, [Si/H]_sun is the same as in the Sun, which I still don't know. Hmm, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun using the fact that n_Si_sun = S, and I know F= H *1e-4.5.

Wait, but maybe I need to consider that in the Sun, the sum of elements adds up in some way? Or perhaps that the number densities are all known for the photosphere. Wait, but without knowing n_Si_sun, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2 without knowing the Sun's [Si/H]_sun.

Because the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2).

Wait, let's see:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3} * n_H2.

Because from earlier, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3 → 10^{[Si/H]_1} = 10^{[Si/H]_sun} *10^0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^{-0.3} * n_H2.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = (10^0.3 * n_H1) / (10^{-0.3} * n_H2) ) * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

Which simplifies to (10^0.3 / 10^{-0.3}) * (n_H1 / n_H2) ) = 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2).

Wait, but what is n_H1/n_H2?

Wait, for both stars, do I know anything about their total hydrogen? I don't think so. Unless the masses come into play. But the mass of the star is not directly giving the number of hydrogen atoms, unless we know the radius or surface gravity. Hmm. Wait, but in the photosphere, the number density is related to surface gravity and temperature, but unless more info is given, I can't relate the masses to the number densities.

Wait, maybe the masses aren't relevant here. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. So, n_Si1 / n_Si2. But without knowing anything else about the stars, perhaps the ratio is just based on the [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, because the ratio of Si atoms would be (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_Si2) ) * (n_Si2/n_H2) * (n_H2/1), wait, perhaps not.

Wait, the ratio is (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_Si2) * (n_Si2/n_Si2) * (n_Si2/n_H2) ? No, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps better to express each star's [Si/H] in terms of the Sun's.

For Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So, the ratio of (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Which is 10^{ ( [Si/H]_sun +0.3 ) - ( [Si/H]_sun -0.3 ) } = 10^{0.6}.

But wait, [Si/H]_sun is the same for both, so it cancels out.

So, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) =10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

Which is approximately 3.98, which is option A.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, n_Si1 / n_Si2 = ?

But wait, (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1) ) = 3.98.

So, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 3.98 * (n_H1/n_H2).

But unless I know n_H1/n_H2, I can't find this ratio. So, I'm stuck again.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the hydrogen densities are the same between the two stars? Or that the stars have the same surface gravity and temperature, so their scale heights are same, leading to similar number densities.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implicitly assuming that n_H is the same for both stars because the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, meaning their H abundance is same as the Sun. But that doesn't necessarily make n_H same.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H depends on the ratio of their masses, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem doesn't give any data about the surface gravity or radius, so perhaps the ratio is just 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to think that the ratio of n_Si1/n_Si2 is (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) * (n_Si2/n_Si2) * (n_Si2/n_H2) ) No, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think that n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_Si2) * (n_Si2/n_H2) * (n_H2/1) ) No, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms is (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_Si2) ) = (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) * (n_H2/n_H1) ) = 3.98 * (n_H2/n_H1).

But without knowing n_H2/n_H1, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the hydrogen and just take the ratio as 3.98. Because otherwise, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the hydrogen number density is the same for both stars, so n_H1 =n_H2. Then the ratio is just 3.98.

But why would n_H be the same? Well, perhaps because they are main-sequence stars with similar masses, but the given masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. Hmm, not the same, so their surface gravities would be different. So, the number densities might not be the same.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any data about the radius or surface gravity, so perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that I don't need to consider n_H, and just compute the ratio based on [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but that would require the total number of hydrogen atoms to be the same, which is not necessarily the case.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of silicon in the photospheres is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1 / n_H1) * (n_H1 / n_Si2) * (n_Si2 / n_H2) ) * (n_H2) ?

No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the abundance ratios, not the absolute number densities.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's (n_Si1/n_Si2) = ?

But without knowing n_Si for each, perhaps the ratio is n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1).

But without knowing (n_H2/n_H1), perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the ratio is just (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) ) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98 → option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the answer is 10^{0.3+0.3} =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Hmm. Let me recap:

Star_1: [Si/Fe] =0.3. [Fe/H]=0 → [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun +0.3 → 10^{[Si/H]_1}=10^{[Si/H]_sun} *10^{0.3} → n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Similarly, n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *10^{-0.3}.

So, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) )= 10^{0.6} → approx 3.98.

But this is the ratio of (n_Si1/n_H1) to (n_Si2/n_H2). The problem asks for n_Si1/n_Si2.

Wait, but unless the H densities are the same, I can't relate n_Si1/n_Si2 directly.

So, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H densities are the same, making the ratio 3.98.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundances are same, so n_H1 =n_H2.

Wait, but how would that be?

Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 →n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So, unless the sun's n_Fe and n_Mg are the same, which they aren't, their H densities could be different.

Wait, but if the problem isn't giving any data about the H densities, perhaps the answer is 3.98, which is option A.

So, I think the answer is A) ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun). This allows us to express the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio ([Si/H]) for each star relative to the Sun.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the iron-to-hydrogen abundance ratio is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - Using [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the silicon-to-iron abundance ratio in Star_1 is \( n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) \).
   - Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = (n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \), we find \( n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \).
   - Thus, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun + 0.3.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the magnesium-to-hydrogen abundance ratio is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
   - Using [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the magnesium-to-silicon abundance ratio in Star_2 is \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{Si,sun}}) \).
   - Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = (n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \), we find \( n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3} \).
   - Thus, [Si/H]_2 = [Si/H]_sun - 0.3.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}) \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}}{(n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}) \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

Since \( n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}} \) is not provided, we assume it cancels out, and the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}})}{(n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}})} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}})}{10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}})} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Final Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
