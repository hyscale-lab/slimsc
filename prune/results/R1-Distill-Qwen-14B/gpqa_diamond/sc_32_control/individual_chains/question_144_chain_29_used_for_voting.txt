Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they don't travel far because they're massive and have short lifetimes. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance, which I think depends on how long the particle lives on average and how fast it's moving.

The problem gives me some specific values: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance from these. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

First, I think I should calculate the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. I remember that Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, but I need to make sure about the units here.

Wait, more accurately, the width Γ is the total decay rate, which is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I should double-check: yes, because the natural linewidth is Γ, and the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, so ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. I need to convert that into units compatible with ħ. ħ is usually in units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me think about the constants.

I recall that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is roughly 2.056e-24 s. Hmm, that's a very short lifetime.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime. But wait, the meson is produced with some energy, so I should find its velocity based on its energy and mass.

The energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the relativistic energy is given by E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²), but since we're working in units where c is 1 (like in particle physics), E = γ m. So γ = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So γ is approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity β is given by β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that. γ squared is (6.6667)^2 ≈ 44.444. So 1/γ² is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887. So the velocity is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. Because sometimes, I might make a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me compute γ again. 8 / 1.2 is indeed 6.666... So γ = 6.6667.

Now, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (6.6667)^2 ))).

Compute 6.6667 squared: 6.6667^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775: Let's compute that. I know that 0.988^2 is (0.988)^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.001568 + 0.000064 = approx 0.962, which is higher than 0.9775. Hmm, wait no. Wait, 0.988 squared is 0.976144. Oh wait, wait. 0.988^2 = (0.988)(0.988). Let me compute 988 * 988.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. 0.9887^2: Let's compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it precisely. Let me think.

Compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me see. 0.9885^2 is 0.9885 * 0.9885.

Let me compute 9885 * 9885:

Wait, perhaps I should not get bogged down. Let's just take an approximate value. Let's say 0.9887 is about sqrt(0.9775). So β ≈ 0.9887c.

Now, the velocity v = βc ≈ 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 0.9887 times 3e8:

0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Okay, so v ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is 2.056e-24 s.

So the decay length is L = v * τ.

Compute that: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = 2.966 * 2.056 * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.056 ≈ let's compute that.

2 * 2 is 4, 0.966 * 2 is about 1.932, 2 * 0.056 is 0.112, and 0.966 * 0.056 is about 0.054. Wait, perhaps a better way.

Compute 2.966 * 2.056:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932

2.966 * 0.056 = 0.166816

So total is 5.932 + 0.166816 ≈ 6.0988.

So L ≈ 6.0988e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16, and option D is 4.0655e-16. Hmm, none of them are about 6e-16.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the lifetime.

Wait, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Let me compute that again.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Hmm, so my calculation leads to a decay distance of about 6.1e-16 meters. But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should compute the mean lifetime in the lab frame, considering that the particle is moving relativistically. So the lifetime that matters is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma. Wait, no, the lifetime τ is the mean lifetime in the rest frame, and when the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Wait, no, wait: the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the rest frame, which is τ_0 = ħ / Γ. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is γ τ_0. Because of time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by a factor of gamma.

Wait, but earlier I took τ as the lab frame lifetime. So maybe I messed up.

Wait, no, wait. The width Γ is the same in all frames, right? Or is Γ frame-dependent? Hmm, this is a point I'm not entirely sure about. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime in the rest frame.

Wait, I think that the width Γ is the same in all frames, but the lifetime τ is longer in the moving frame because of time dilation. So the proper lifetime τ_0 is ħ / Γ. Then, the observed lifetime τ = γ τ_0.

Ah! That's a crucial mistake I made earlier.

So in my initial calculation, I took τ as the lab frame lifetime, but that's wrong. The proper lifetime is τ_0 = ħ / Γ, and the lab frame lifetime is τ = γ τ_0.

So let me recalculate.

Compute τ_0 first: ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s. That's the proper lifetime.

Then, the lab frame lifetime is τ_lab = γ * τ_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute that: 6.6667 * 2.056875 is approximately 13.7109375e-24 s.

Wait, 6.6667 * 2.056875 = let me compute that.

2 * 6.6667 is 13.3334.

0.056875 * 6.6667 ≈ 0.056875 *6=0.34125, 0.056875 *0.6667≈ ~0.0379. So total ≈0.3791.

So 13.3334 + 0.3791 ≈ 13.7125.

So τ_lab ≈13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, 13.7125e-24 s is 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, the velocity v is 0.9887c ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So the decay distance L = v * τ_lab = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 2.966 *1.37125 * 1e-15.

Let me compute 2.966 * 1.37125.

2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.966 * 1.37125: Hmm, 0.966 * 1 = 0.966, 0.966 * 0.37125 ≈ 0.3587. So total 0.966 +0.3587 ≈ 1.3247.

So 2.7425 + 1.3247 ≈ 4.0672.

So L ≈4.0672e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, another thing: when I compute gamma, I should be precise. Let me recheck.

E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) but since c=1, it's 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... which is 20/3.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Then, the calculation of beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - 9/(400)) because gamma^2 is (20/3)^2 =400/9.

So 1/(gamma²) =9/400=0.0225.

So 1-0.0225=0.9775, square root is sqrt(0.9775)=?

Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.98869. Let me compute 0.98869^2: (0.98869)^2 = 0.9775000, so yes.

So beta is approximately 0.98869. So v =0.98869c.

So let me recalculate L.

v = 0.98869c = 0.98869 * 3e8 m/s.

So 0.98869 *3e8 = 2.96607e8 m/s.

Tau_lab is gamma * tau_0.

Tau_0 is 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582/0.32)e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So tau_lab = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

20 * 2.056875 =41.1375.

41.1375 /3 =13.7125. So 13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

So L = v * tau_lab = (2.96607e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s).

Compute 2.96607 *1.37125.

Let me compute 2.96607 * 1.37125.

Let me break this down:

2.96607 * 1 = 2.96607

2.96607 * 0.3 = 0.889821

2.96607 * 0.07 = 0.2076249

2.96607 * 0.00125 = 0.0037075875

Adding all together:

2.96607 + 0.889821 = 3.855891

3.855891 + 0.2076249 =4.0635159

4.0635159 + 0.0037075875 ≈4.0672235.

So L ≈4.0672e-15 meters.

Looking back, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close enough, probably due to more precise intermediate steps.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by calculating its lifetime in the lab frame. The width \( \Gamma_X \) is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}.
\]

Given \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Since the meson is moving relativistically, the lab frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is longer due to time dilation:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0,
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. The energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) give:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

Thus:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the velocity \( v \) of the meson using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}, \quad v = \beta c.
\]

With \( \gamma^2 = (6.6667)^2 \approx 44.444 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus:

\[
v = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The mean decay distance \( L \) is the product of the velocity and the lab frame lifetime:

\[
L = v \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \), we get:

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \times (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the closest match is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
