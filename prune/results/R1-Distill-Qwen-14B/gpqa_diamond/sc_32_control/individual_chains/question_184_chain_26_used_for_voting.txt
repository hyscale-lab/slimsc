Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So numbering is such that the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The numbering should give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So if the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3, then the numbering starts where the ethoxy is. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a certain order.

Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene has three substituents: at position 1, ethoxy; position 2, tert-butyl; and position 3, nitro. So the benzene ring has substituents in the order ethoxy (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3). So the arrangement is ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (which is adjacent to ethoxy), and nitro at position 3 (which is next to ethoxy and across from tert-butyl, I think).

But wait, benzene is a ring, so let me imagine the positions. If substituents are at 1,2,3, that's a meta arrangement for some and adjacent for others. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are such that ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (ortho), nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy, and adjacent to tert-butyl). 

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene to get this compound with high yield.

Looking at the options, each one lists a series of reactions. I need to figure out which option correctly orders the steps.

First, perhaps I should think about the synthesis steps. Benzene is the starting material. To get substituents on the ring, we'll likely use electrophilic substitution reactions. So, the order in which substituents are added will affect the positions due to directing effects.

The substituents we're adding are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, but as an alkyl group, it's activating and an ortho/para director. So the order in which these groups are added will determine where the next substituent goes.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating and meta-directing. So if we add nitro first, that would direct the next groups to meta positions. But in our target, the nitro is at position 3. Let's see.

Let me outline the target molecule again. The substituents are ethoxy (position 1), tert-butyl (position 2), and nitro (position 3). So, the order they are added would affect where the others go.

Wait, but the target has three substituents. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding each substituent in a certain order, considering the directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of activating and deactivating groups. Let's think: nitration is often done with a nitrating mixture (HNO3 and H2SO4). Friedel-Crafts alkylation uses AlCl3 as a catalyst, like with tert-butyl chloride. Similarly, ethoxy groups can be introduced via etherification or perhaps via another substitution.

Wait, but benzene doesn't have hydroxyl groups, so how do you get an ethoxy group? Oh, maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually difficult unless there's a strong activating group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, like using an alkoxide or via a different method.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as an ether via a substitution. But benzene can't typically do that unless it's activated. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis, but that usually involves an alkoxide and an alkyl halide.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a substituent through an ether formation. Alternatively, maybe via a nitration first, then alkylation, then another nitration? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about directing effects. Suppose I first introduce an activating group; that would make the ring more reactive. If I add the nitro group first, the ring becomes deactivating, making further substitutions harder. So perhaps it's better to add activating groups first.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible steps:

We need three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl, and nitro.

Which substituent is introduced first? Let's consider which order would allow all substituents to be added with proper directing.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para director. Then add tert-butyl. The next substituent (nitro) would be added after. But nitro is deactivating, so the ring would be harder to substitute after that.

Wait, perhaps we need to add nitro after tert-butyl, but that might not work because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group.

Benzene with ethoxy becomes ethoxybenzene. Then, introduce tert-butyl group. Ethoxy is an activating group, so AlCl3 would help in Friedel-Crafts alkylation. tert-Butyl chloride and AlCl3 would add a tert-butyl group. The tert-butyl is an activating group, so then adding nitro would be possible as the third substituent.

But wait, the nitro group is deactivating, so adding it after would make the ring less reactive. But we need to add it as the third group, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. Then, the next groups would be added in the meta positions relative to nitro. But nitro is a strong deactivating group, which would make the ring less reactive, so perhaps that's not the best order.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, add ethoxy group. Since tert-butyl is activating and o/p-directing, the ethoxy would go in ortho or para to it.

3. Then, add nitro group, which would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but the nitro group in the target is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and across from tert-butyl (position 2). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

First, introduce tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. Then, introduce nitro. Then, introduce ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so after that, adding ethoxy would be harder.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after nitro. But that may complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. But then, the ring becomes deactivated. So maybe that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy. But nitro is meta-directing, so when adding tert-butyl, it would go meta to nitro. Then, adding ethoxy would be directed by both nitro and tert-butyl.

Wait, but let me think about the possible positions.

Nitro group is at position 3.

When we add the first substituent, say, nitro at position 3.

Then, adding tert-butyl: since nitro is meta directing, the next substituent would go in position 1 or 5. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so let's imagine the numbering. If nitro is at position 3, adding tert-butyl as a meta substituent would be at 1 or 5.

But in our target, the tert-butyl is at position 2. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first substituent is ethoxy. Then, tert-butyl is added, which goes ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, nitro is added.

Wait, ethoxy is at position 1. When we add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, it would go either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). So let's say it goes to position 2.

Then, with ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, adding the nitro group would be directed where?

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para), while tert-butyl is also activating (ortho/para). So the next substituent would go ortho or para to both. Hmm, but that can be tricky because the positions may be influenced by multiple substituents.

Wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So relative to position 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl), where is position 3?

That would be meta to ethoxy, and adjacent to tert-butyl. So perhaps the nitro is added in a position that's ortho to tert-butyl and para to ethoxy.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two substituents. The next substituent (nitro) would be added based on the combined directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let's think again.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to add the ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl. But that may not work because after nitro (deactivating), adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts (which requires activating) would be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

So, step 1: benzene + tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

Step 2: tert-butylbenzene + ethoxy group. How? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps via a substitution after activating the ring. Wait, benzene derivatives can undergo substitution if we have a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after adding tert-butyl, we can do a nitration, but that would add a nitro group. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strong activating group, which I don't think is the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an EAS reaction, but ethoxy is a substituent that's typically added via an ether formation. Wait, no, EAS would require an activating group. Benzene is not reactive enough for that, so perhaps we need to have an activating group first.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reactions. Let me see what each step is.

Option A: Steps i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), v) dilute H2SO4, vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (what's that?), vii) NaOH/EtBr (saponification or elimination?), viii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let's see if that makes sense.

But the target has three substituents. So perhaps each option is adding these groups in some order.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of adding substituents. Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it's best added last because it makes the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions.

Alternatively, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, the substituents are at adjacent positions (1 and 2), and another at 3. So, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl are at ortho positions, and nitro is at meta relative to ethoxy.

Let me try to think about the steps in each option.

Option D: The steps are i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?), etc.

Wait, that might not make sense. If we first nitrate benzene, we get nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl is probably a reducing agent. Wait, Fe in HCl is sometimes used for reduction, like in the Bechamp reaction. But I'm not sure. Then adding t-butyl chloride with AlCl3 could be Friedel-Crafts, but nitro groups deactivate the ring, so Friedel-Crafts would not work on nitrobenzene.

So option D's first step would be nitration, then something else. But adding t-butyl after nitration would be difficult.

So probably, option D is not the right sequence.

Looking at option C: Steps i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iv) Fe/HCl, v) NaNO2/HCl, vi) HNO3/H2SO4, vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat, viii) dilute H2SO4, ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps and seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's about adding substituents in a way that directs each new group correctly.

Option B: Steps i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3, ii) HNO3/H2SO4, iii) Fe/HCl, iv) HNO3/H2SO4, v) NaNO2/HCl, vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat, vii) NaOH/EtBr, viii) SO3/H2SO4, ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-butyl, they nitrate, then maybe reduce, but not sure.

Option A: After t-butyl alkylation, then nitrate, then sulfonate? Sulfonation is another EAS reaction, but I'm not sure how that would fit in.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule.

The substituents are ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro. Each substituent has its own directing effect.

So, perhaps the synthesis steps need to be:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add t-butyl group.

3. Add nitro group.

But wait, how do you add ethoxy to benzene? Because benzene doesn't have a leaving group. So perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But benzene isn't very reactive for that. Alternatively, perhaps via a substitution where we have a good leaving group.

Wait, another way to introduce an ethoxy group is via an ether formation. For example, via the Schorigin reaction or via a Friedel-Crafts acyloxylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can introduce a hydroxyl group first, then convert it to ethoxy.

Wait, but how would you introduce a hydroxyl group on benzene? Maybe via nitration, then reduction, but that's a common method for introducing amino groups, not hydroxyl.

Alternatively, perhaps via a sulfonation step, then displacement. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring with another group.

For instance, if we have a nitro group in place, but that's deactivating. Alternatively, perhaps a t-butyl group is added first via Friedel-Crafts, then an ethoxy group is added.

Wait, but how? Because after adding t-butyl, the ring is activated, so perhaps another EAS can occur.

So, step 1: benzene + t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

Step 2: tert-butylbenzene undergoes nitration → tert-butyl nitrobenzene. Wait, but where? The nitro group would be added in the meta position relative to t-butyl (since t-butyl is activating and o/p directing, so nitro would go o or p to it.

Wait, but we need the nitro to be at position 3. Let me think about the structure.

If the t-butyl is at position 2, the ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3.

So, perhaps after adding t-butyl, we add nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so adding ethoxy after nitro would be difficult.

Alternatively, maybe we add ethoxy before nitro.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy. Let me think differently. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after making a good leaving group.

Let me think: perhaps first, we introduce a bromine atom on the benzene ring. Then, substitute that bromine with ethoxy. But benzene bromide is difficult to make. Alternatively, perhaps using a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution of a nitro group. Wait, but nitro groups can be reduced to amino groups, which can then undergo substitution.

Hmm, maybe.

Here's a possible order:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitrobenzene to aniline.

3. Alkylation of aniline to introduce ethoxy group. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, but in this case, we're introducing an ethoxy group. Alternatively, perhaps we can make the ethoxy group by introducing a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to approach this by looking at the options again.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. We need to add them in a certain order.

Let me consider the options again.

Option B: i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So, t-butyl group added first.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So nitro group is added next.

iii) Fe/HCl → likely reduction of something. Maybe reducing nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? That seems odd because after nitration, you have a nitro group which is deactivating.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that's usually after making an amine.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, perhaps to a phenol.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps elimination to form an ether.

Hmm, not sure. Let's see what steps B is taking.

After adding t-butyl, then nitro, then Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro to amine), then another nitration, which seems unlikely because the ring is already deactivated. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option C: i) t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl group.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is a strong activating, o/p-directing group.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So nitro group would be added o or p to the sulfonic acid group. But our target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this isn't right.

Alternatively, maybe the sulfonic acid group is a step towards introducing something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Option A: i) t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Then iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so probably not.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Then ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. iii) t-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. If the ring has an amine group (from Fe/HCl reducing nitro to amine), then Friedel-Crafts could proceed. But amine is a strong activating group, so adding t-butyl would be possible.

Wait, let me outline this:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butyl group added.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. Aniline is strongly activating, so yes, that would work. So step 3 would add t-butyl to aniline.

But where? Since aniline is a strong activating group, the t-butyl group would go in the ortho or para position relative to the amine. But in the target, the t-butyl is at position 2, and the amine would be at position 1 (if ethoxy is at another position). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but after adding t-butyl to aniline, we would have substituents at positions 1 (amine) and, say, position 2 (t-butyl). Then, perhaps another substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps I should think about the possible substituents.

Another angle: the target has three substituents. Let's see the options that have the right number of substituent additions. Looking at the options, they all have multiple steps, but perhaps each step is adding a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

But how? Maybe via a substitution reaction, which requires a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Friedel-Crafts acyloxylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after making a benzyl halide. But benzyl chloride is not easily made from benzene.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a substituent through an ether formation, but that requires a nucleophilic substitution on the aromatic ring, which isn't straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after creating a nitro group which is then reduced. For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Ethyl bromide with a base to substitute the amine → introducing ethoxy group. But I'm not sure about this step.

Wait, maybe via a nucleophilic substitution. Let me think: if we have an amine group, perhaps we can convert it to a good leaving group, like a tosylate, and then substitute it with an ethoxide.

But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Let me try to think of each substituent's position.

Assuming that the ethoxy group is added first, then the ring is activated, making it easier to add the other groups.

But wait, we can't directly substitute benzene with ethoxy. So perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after t-butyl and nitro groups. But that would require the ring to have both t-butyl and nitro groups. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group, directed by the t-butyl group.

3. Add ethoxy group, directed by the existing substituents.

But how would the ethoxy be added? Because after adding a nitro group (deactivating), adding ethoxy via EAS would be difficult.

Wait, unless the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction, which may not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last.

Wait, let's think about the substituents in the target: ethoxy (activating, o/p), t-butyl (activating, o/p), and nitro (deactivating, m).

So, perhaps the nitro group is added last because it is deactivating, which would make subsequent reactions difficult. So, the order might be ethoxy, t-butyl, then nitro.

But again, how to add ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution. Let's say, after making a bromine substituent. But how to make bromine on benzene?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after making a nitro group, which is then reduced to an amino group.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Let me think: A possible route for ethoxy could be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. React aniline with ethyl bromide under basic conditions (like in the presence of NaOH) to form an ethyl ether. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, and under basic conditions, perhaps the ethyl group can be introduced as an ether.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this step. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group is introduced via a substitution on the amino group. For example, if the amino group is converted into a better leaving group, like a tosylate, then substituted with ethoxide.

But this seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acyloxylation, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option D: Steps i) nitrate, ii) reduce nitro to amine, iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl, iv) nitrate again, etc. But after the first nitrate and reduction, the ring has an amine group. Friedel-Crafts would work on aniline to add t-butyl. Where would it go? Ortho or para to the amine. Then, perhaps adding nitro again, but that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iv) would be directed by the t-butyl group.

Wait, let's try to outline option D's steps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts: t-butyl chloride → adds t-butyl group to aniline. Since aniline is activating, t-butyl would go ortho or para.

But in our target, ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, if aniline is at position 1, t-butyl could be added at position 2 (ortho). That makes sense.

Then, step iv is another nitration, but the ring now has aniline (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). So, where would nitro go? The existing substituents are activating, so nitration would occur where? The t-butyl is ortho to the amine. So, the nitro could be added meta to the amine (position 3) or para (position 4), but position 3 is adjacent to t-butyl. Hmm, but nitro is a strong deactivating group. After adding nitro in position 3, the ring would have three substituents.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are ethoxy (position 1), t-butyl (position 2), nitro (position 3). So, if in option D, after steps 1-3, you have aniline (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2), then nitration would add nitro at position 3, which is meta to the amine and adjacent to t-butyl. That seems to fit.

But then, step iv is nitration. Nitro would be added at position 3. But now, you have aniline, t-butyl, and nitro. Then, step v is NaNO2/HCl → which is diazotization. But in what conditions? Aniline is already present, but after steps 1-3, the amine is in position 1, but after nitration, it's still present.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, you have aniline, t-butyl, and nitro. Then, step v is diazotization. But for diazotization, you usually have a primary amine, which is treated with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt. But in this case, with aniline and nitro groups, perhaps the diazonium salt forms on the amine.

Then, step vi is H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. So, the amine (position 1) would become a hydroxyl group.

Then, step vii is NaOH and EtBr → perhaps an elimination reaction to form an ether. Wait, but how? Maybe via an SN2 substitution. If the hydroxyl group is at position 1, and we have ethyl bromide under basic conditions, perhaps the hydroxyl group is replaced by ethoxy. That would make sense. So the hydroxyl (from step vi) would become ethoxy via SN2 in step vii.

So, after these steps, we would have ethoxy at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. That matches the target structure.

Wait, but let's check the steps in option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl added to aniline, ortho to amine (position 1 → position 2).

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Now, with substituents at 1 (amine) and 2 (t-butyl), the nitration would add nitro group where? The nitro would be directed by the t-butyl, perhaps at position 3 (meta to t-butyl, which is position 2).

So, after step iv, nitro is at position 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amine (position 1) → diazonium chloride.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis to form phenol (position 1 → OH).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution of OH with OEt (ethoxy group). So, OH at 1 becomes OEt.

So, the structure would be ethoxy (1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3). Exactly the target.

So, the steps in option D would produce the target molecule. Let me double-check.

Option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl ortho to amine (position 2).

iv) Nitrate again → add nitro at position 3 (directed by t-butyl's ortho/para? Or maybe by the amine as well).

Wait, but in step iv, the ring has amine (position 1), t-butyl (position 2). Nitration would primarily be directed by the strongest directing group. Both amine (activating, o/p) and t-butyl (activating, o/p) are present. So, the incoming nitro group would go to a position that's o or p to both. Hmm, that may not be possible. Wait, the available positions are 3,4,5,6. But position 3 is adjacent to 2 (t-butyl), and position 4 is para to 1 (amine). So, perhaps the nitro group would go to position 4, which is para to the amine. But in our target, nitro is at position 3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iv is directed by the t-butyl group, which is at position 2. So, the nitro would go meta to t-butyl, which would be position 5 (if t-butyl is at 2, meta would be 5 and 6?). Wait, benzene is a ring, so the positions are arranged in a circle.

Wait, if t-butyl is at position 2, then meta positions would be 5 (opposite to 2), but that's not directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added at position 3, which is ortho to the t-butyl group (position 2), and meta to the amine (position 1).

Wait, in that case, the nitro would be at position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl (position 2), and meta to the amine (position 1). That makes sense. So, the nitration in step iv would add nitro at position 3, directed by the t-butyl group.

So, after step iv, positions 1 (amine), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Then, step v: diazotization → the amine (position 1) is converted to a diazonium salt.

Step vi: hydrolysis to phenol → OH at position 1.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr → substitution of OH with OEt → ethoxy at position 1.

So, the final structure: ethoxy (1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3). Which matches the target.

But wait, would the nitration in step iv add nitro at position 3, which is ortho to t-butyl (position 2)? Because t-butyl is an activating group, and directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So, with t-butyl at 2, the para position would be 6, and ortho positions are 1 and 3. But position 1 is already occupied by the amine, so nitro would go to position 3.

Yes, that makes sense. So, step iv adds nitro at position 3.

So, this sequence in option D seems to fit.

Comparing the options, option D's steps would lead to the target structure.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D's steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl (position 2).

iv) Nitrate → nitro at position 3.

v) Diazotization → form diazonium at position 1.

vi) Hydrolysis → OH at position 1.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → substitute OH with OEt.

Then, are there more steps beyond vii? Because the target has three substituents, and the steps up to vii would have all three. So, perhaps the remaining steps in option D are for some other purpose, but the key substituents are already in place.

Wait, the target structure is 2-t-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, after step vii, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, option D's steps produce the correct structure.

Looking back at the options, option D's steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts, add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again, add nitro.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution, add ethoxy.

So, this sequence would produce the target molecule.

Looking at the other options, I don't think they produce the correct substituent positions. So the correct option is D.

To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro) are added in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3, respectively) while considering the directing effects of each group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Adds the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring, but the position of the nitro group is unclear due to the directing effects of the tert-butyl group.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
4. Subsequent steps (e.g., NaNO₂/HCl, H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat, NaOH/EtBr) do not align with the required transformations to achieve the target structure.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

### Option B:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Adds the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring, but the position of the nitro group is unclear.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step is unlikely to produce the correct substitution pattern.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine group.
6. **H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution of the phenol group with an ethoxy group.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

### Option C:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Adds the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring, but the position of the nitro group is unclear.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine group.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step is unlikely to produce the correct substitution pattern.
7. **H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Does not contribute to the desired transformations.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution of the phenol group with an ethoxy group.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

### Option D:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates benzene to form nitrobenzene.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming aniline.
3. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Adds the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, directed ortho to the amine group at position 2.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring again, with the nitro group directed meta to the tert-butyl group at position 3.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotizes the amine group at position 1.
6. **H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to form a phenol at position 1.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the phenol group with an ethoxy group at position 1.

This sequence successfully produces 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, as the substituents are added in the correct positions and the directing effects of the groups are appropriately utilized.
