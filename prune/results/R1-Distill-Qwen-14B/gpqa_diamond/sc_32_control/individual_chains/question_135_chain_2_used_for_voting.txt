Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about boson decay. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh, right, in the interaction Lagrangian, I think the structure is usually something like λ ψ† ψ X or something similar. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The general form for a Yukawa interaction is something like L = -g ψ† ψ X, where X is the boson field, and ψ is the fermion field. So maybe in this case, the coupling is such that the boson X couples to fermions.

But what's important here is that the interaction allows X to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the boson X can decay into particles like e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, and quark-antiquark pairs. But the question is about which decays are kinematically allowed, considering the mass of X.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So, the decay products must have masses such that the sum of the two particles' masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Wait, but when a boson decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the fermion mass is important. For example, if the fermion has a mass m, then the minimum energy required is when the two fermions are produced at rest, each with energy m. So the sum is 2m, which has to be less than or equal to the mass of X. So, 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, the known fermion masses are:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (negligible, so 2m ≈ 0.001 GeV)
Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV → 2m ≈ 0.2 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV → 2m ≈ 3.55 GeV. Hmm, wait, 3.55 is less than 6, so tau can be produced. Wait, no, wait: 3.55 is less than 6, but wait, 1.777 *2 is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau can be produced.

Quarks: let's see their masses. But wait, the problem is about the allowed decays based on mass, but for quarks, we have to consider that they're confined, but for the purposes of decay kinematics, perhaps we're assuming they can be produced as pairs in the decay. But the actual masses of quarks vary. Let me think about the current quark masses.

Up quark (u): ~2 MeV → 2m ≈ 0.004 GeV. Way below 6 GeV.
Down quark (d): ~4 MeV → 2m ≈ 0.008 GeV.
Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV → 2m ≈ 0.19 GeV.
Charm quark (c): ~1.2 GeV → 2m ≈ 2.4 GeV.
Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV → 2m ≈ 9 GeV. Oh wait, 9 GeV is larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So for a bottom quark pair, 2mb is 9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So production of b b-bar is not allowed kinematically.

Similarly, top quark (t) is way heavier, about 173 GeV. So 2mt is 346 GeV, way beyond 6 GeV. So the decay X→t t-bar is impossible.

So which fermions are allowed? Let's list the possible fermion pairs:

- e+ e-: allowed because 2me ≈ 0, which is less than 6 GeV.
- mu+ mu-: 2mμ ≈ 0.2 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
- tau+ tau-: 2mtau ≈ 3.55 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
- u u-bar: allowed.
- d d-bar: allowed.
- s s-bar: allowed.
- c c-bar: 2mc = 2.4 GeV <6 → allowed.
- b b-bar: 9 GeV >6 → not allowed.
- t t-bar: way too heavy, not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are into e+e-, mu+mu-, tau+tau-, u, d, s, c quarks.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV per quark, so 9 GeV total. That's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b's. So option A is out.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, wait. Let me check the masses again. Tau is ~1.777 GeV, so 2m = ~3.55 GeV which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed. So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That looks correct.

Wait, but option C includes t, which we know can't because 2mt is way larger than 6 GeV. So option C is out.

Option D: X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So same as option B except includes b. But b is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, no, let me recheck. Wait, option B includes c c-bar but not b. So for fermions, the allowed are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait: another thing to consider is whether the fermions are charged leptons or quarks. Because in the Lagrangian, the interaction is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa coupling term. So ψ_f would be a Dirac fermion, so the interaction term would allow X to couple to ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. So any fermion that can be created by this term would be allowed, but depending on what ψ_f is.

Wait, the term is written as λ f ψ_f-bar ψ_f X. So ψ_f is the fermion field, and f is perhaps a flavor index or something else. Wait, perhaps f here is the charge of the fermion. Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the term is written as λ ψ_f-bar ψ_f X, which would imply that X couples to any fermion ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the mass allows it.

So the possible decay products would be all possible charged leptons and quarks, provided their mass is less than 3 GeV (since 2m <6 GeV).

So the possible pairs are:

- e+ e-: allowed
- mu+ mu-: allowed
- tau+ tau-: allowed (since 2mtau ~3.55 GeV <6)
- u u-bar: allowed
- d d-bar: allowed
- s s-bar: allowed
- c c-bar: allowed (2mc= 2.4 <6)
- b b-bar: Not allowed (2mb=9 >6)
- t t-bar: Not allowed.

So the allowed decays are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is out.

Option A includes b, so wrong.

Option C includes t, which is impossible.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, allowing it to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). This means \( 2m \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Fermion Masses and Decay Allowance:
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9 > 6 \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed kinematically. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed kinematically. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed kinematically. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), as listed in **Option B**.
