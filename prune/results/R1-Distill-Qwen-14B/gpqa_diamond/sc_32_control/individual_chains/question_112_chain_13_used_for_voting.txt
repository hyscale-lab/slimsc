Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. Alright, the question involves an electron's state and some operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. Oh wait, right, because in quantum mechanics, states should have a magnitude of 1.

So I'll start by finding the normalization factor. The state vector has components (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization is done by taking the inner product of the state with itself. The inner product in this case would be the sum of each component multiplied by its complex conjugate.

Let me calculate that. The first component is (1+i), its conjugate is (1-i). Second component is (2-i), conjugate is (2+i). So the inner product is |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, because the state is a vector in a two-dimensional space with basis |up> and |down>, right? So the state can be written as a column vector [a; b], where a is (1+i) and b is (2 - i). The normalization is |a|² + |b|².

So |a|² is (1+i)(1-i) because a* is the conjugate. (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i + i - i². i² is -1, so 1 - (-1) = 2. Wait, 1-i+i is 1, so 1 - (i²) which is 1 - (-1) = 2. So |a|² is 2.

Then |b|² is (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i². The imaginary parts cancel, and i² is -1. So 4 - (-1) = 5. So |b|² is 5.

So the total is 2 + 5 = 7. So the norm is sqrt(7) because the inner product is 7, and normalization requires dividing by sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ; (2 - i)/√7 ].

Next part: the operator whose matrix representation is A with elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i different from j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would make A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Because diagonal elements are zero, off-diagonal are ħ/2.

So the operator is A = (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Hmm, that's the same as (ħ/2)(X), where X is the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so yeah, that's correct.

Now, the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator A. Oh, wait, no, wait. The operator's eigenstates are the states in which we can measure the system. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in |alpha>.

But wait, first I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A.

Wait, the operator A is given by the matrix [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. Let me call this matrix as (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]], which is (ħ/2) X, where X is the Pauli matrix.

The eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)* (+1) and (ħ/2)* (-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the eigenstates would be the same as the eigenstates of X.

The eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, respectively.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check. The Pauli X matrix has eigenstates |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/√2 and |-x> = (|0> - |1>)/√2, assuming computational basis |0> and |1>, which in this case are |up> and |down>, I think.

Wait, no, the problem defines |up> and |down> as the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So in that basis, X (which is the Pauli X) would have eigenstates in the x-direction.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written in terms of |up> and |down>.

So the eigenstate |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Now, the state |alpha> is given. We can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, and the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the overlap of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, then square those to get the probabilities.

So let's compute the coefficients. Let me write the state |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 , (2 - i)/√7 ]

Expressed as a vector: ( (1+i)/√7 , (2 - i)/√7 )

The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 = [1/√2, 1/√2]^T

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2 = [1/√2, -1/√2]^T

So to find the coefficients c1 and c2 such that |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>, we can compute the inner products.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |< +x | alpha >|², and similarly for the other eigenvalue.

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | alpha > = [1/√2, 1/√2] * [ (1+i)/√7, (2 - i)/√7 ]^T

So that's (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (1/√2)(2 - i)/√7.

Factor out 1/(√2 * √7):

= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (√2 * √7 )

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3. So the numerator is 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3 / (√2 * √7 ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9 /14 ≈ 0.642857. Hmm, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which adds to 1, so that's a possibility.

Wait, but let me compute the other inner product as well, just to confirm.

Compute < -x | alpha > = [1/√2, -1/√2] * [ (1+i)/√7, (2 -i)/√7 ]

= (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (-1/√2)(2 -i)/√7

Factor out 1/(√2 * √7):

[ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (√2 * √7 )

Simplify numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i )

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

The probability is the square of the magnitude: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (14) ) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, wait a second. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, 5/14 is around 0.357. So the options don't exactly match any of these. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So option A's probabilities would be about 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, wait another thing: maybe I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-calculate < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

Compute < +x | alpha >:

= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (√2 * √7 )

= (3) / (√14 )

So the magnitude squared is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, < -x | alpha >:

= [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (√14 )

= ( (1-2) + (i +i) ) / √14 )

= (-1 + 2i)/√14.

The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). So the magnitude squared is 5/(14) ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are about 0.643 and 0.357. Now, looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which sums to 1, but option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which sums to 0.9, so that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, no, I think my computation is correct. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. But let me check the other parts.

The next part is the average value of the operator A. The expectation value <A> is given by < alpha | A | alpha >.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, the expectation value is sum (eigenvalue * probability).

So the expectation value is (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( -ħ/2 )

= [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14

= (4 * ħ/2 ) /14

= ( 2 ħ ) /14

= ħ /7.

Wait, so the expectated value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A has expectation value hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the expectation is hbar/7. So option A should be the correct one.

Wait, but let me compute the expectation value another way to confirm. Because perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, the expectation value <A> can be computed as the inner product of |alpha> with A |alpha>.

So let me compute A |alpha>.

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So A |alpha> = ( (0 * a + (ħ/2) * b ), ( (ħ/2) * a + 0 * b ) )

Where a = (1+i)/√7, b = (2 -i)/√7.

So the first component is (ħ/2) * b = (ħ/2) * (2 -i)/√7.

Second component is (ħ/2) * a = (ħ/2) * (1+i)/√7.

So A|alpha> is [ (2 -i) ħ/(2√7 ), (1+i) ħ/(2√7 ) ]

Now, <alpha | A |alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> with A|alpha>.

So it's (a* ) * (A|alpha> )_1 + (b* ) * (A|alpha> )_2.

Compute each term:

a* is (1-i)/√7.

(A|alpha>)_1 is (2 -i) ħ/(2√7 )

So first term: (1 -i)/√7 * (2 -i) ħ/(2√7 )

Multiply denominators: 1/√7 * 1/(2√7 ) = 1/(2*7) )= 1/14.

Multiply numerators: (1 -i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So first term is (1 -3i) * ħ /14.

Similarly, second term:

b* is (2 +i)/√7.

(A|alpha> )_2 is (1 +i) ħ/(2√7 )

So second term: (2 +i)/√7 * (1 +i) ħ/(2√7 )

Denominator: 1/√7 * 1/(2√7 ) = 1/(2*7) =1/14.

Numerators: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2i + i(1) + i^2 = 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So second term is (1 +3i) ħ /14.

Adding the two terms:

(1 -3i) ħ/14 + (1 +3i) ħ/14 = [ (1+1) + (-3i +3i) ] * ħ/14.

The imaginary parts cancel, 2 * ħ/14 = ħ/7.

So the expectation value is indeed ħ/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.357), and the expectation value is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A matches these.

So the correct answer should be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron's state described by \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to normalize the state, calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), and find the average value of \( A \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, compute the norm:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates and eigenvalues of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is given by the matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} X \), where \( X \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenvalues of \( X \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( X \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are given by the squared overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these states:
\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2, \quad P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2.
\]
Compute \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \):
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability \( P(+x) \) is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]
Similarly, compute \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability \( P(-x) \) is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1+4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} X \), the expectation value becomes:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | X | \alpha \rangle.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( X \) are \( \pm 1 \), with probabilities \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \). Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} \cdot 1 + \frac{5}{14} \cdot (-1) \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
