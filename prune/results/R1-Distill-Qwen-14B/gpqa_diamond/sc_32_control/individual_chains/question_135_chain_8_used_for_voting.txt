Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think that's a typo or maybe a formatting issue. Oh wait, perhaps it's L = -λ ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh right, because in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to fermions, and the Lagrangian looks similar. So this X boson is likely an analogous field, maybe a Higgs-like boson.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I'm supposed to find the possible decay channels of X at the lowest order, considering kinematics. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the energy (mass of the boson) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So each possible decay must satisfy m_X >= 2 m_fermion.

So first, I need to find the masses of all the possible fermions listed in the options.

Let me list them:

Option A: b, s, u, d, tau+, tau−, e+ e−
So the fermions here are b quarks, s quarks, u quarks, d quarks, tau leptons, and electrons.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e
So these are charm quarks, strange, up, down, tau, muon, electron.

Option C: c, s, u, d, top quarks, tau, mu, e
Wait, top quarks have a mass around 173 GeV, right? So if X is 6 GeV, 2*m_top would be way higher than 6 GeV, so that's impossible. So option C can't be correct because it includes top quarks. So C is out.

Option D: b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So same as A but with mu and tau instead of tau and e, but wait, A includes tau and e, D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Wait, no, looking back:

Wait the options: 

A) X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

B) X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

D) X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, so in the options, the particles are listed as b, s, etc., so for quarks, they are quark-antiquark pairs.

Now, I need to find out which of these fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of all these particles.

Electron (e): about 0.511 MeV, negligible, way less than 3 GeV.

Muon (mu): around 105.7 MeV, also less than 3 GeV.

Tau: about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV.

Up quark (u): current quark mass is around 2.2 MeV, so way under.

Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV, also way under.

Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV, less than 3 GeV.

Charm quark (c): around 1.27 GeV. Wait, 1.27 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So charm quarks could be a possibility if the X can decay into c cbar.

Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV. Wait, 4.5 GeV is more than half of 6 GeV (3 GeV). So 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b bbar because 6 < 9. So any option including b bbar is ruled out.

Top quark (t): too heavy, but option C has it, which we already dismissed.

Tau lepton mass is about 1.78 GeV, so tau+ tau- would require 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is more than that, so tau can be produced.

Similarly, muon: 105.7 MeV, so 2*105.7 is about 0.211 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so muon pairs are allowed.

Electron is even lighter, so e+ e- is definitely allowed.

Charm quark: 1.27 GeV, so 2*1.27=2.54 GeV. 6 GeV is larger than that, so c cbar is allowed.

Bottom quark: 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV. 6 <9, so no.

So the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because their masses are all below 3 GeV.

Now looking at the options:

Option A includes b bbar which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all these fermions are allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is out.

Option C is out because of top quark.

So the correct answer should be option B. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option B has c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but the original interaction term: the Lagrangian is given as L = -λ ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. So ψ_f is a fermion field. So which fermions are coupled to X? Because the interaction term determines which fermions can decay from X.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to up-type quarks, down-type quarks, and charged leptons. So the coupling is proportional to the mass of the fermion, which is why the Yukawa coupling is λ = m_f / v, where v is the Higgs VEV (~246 GeV).

So in this problem, the interaction term is similar, which suggests that X couples to fermions, and the coupling strength is proportional to the fermion mass.

But wait, the way the Lagrangian is written, it's proportional to ψ_f bar X ψ_f. So for each fermion f, this term is present if the fermion has a mass.

Therefore, all fermions with mass can couple to X, but the decay is kinematically allowed only if 2 m_f <= m_X.

So in our case, m_X = 6 GeV.

So fermions that have mass up to 3 GeV can be decay products.

So let me list all the fermions and their approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV (too heavy)
- Top quark (t): way too heavy
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV

So all of u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau are allowed because their masses are under 3 GeV.

But wait, the X boson can decay into any of these particles, provided that 2m_f <= m_X.

So the possible decay channels are into pairs of these particles.

Therefore, looking at the options, the allowed fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Which is exactly option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau, mu mu, e e.

But wait, option B says tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, etc. Oh in the options, they are written as tau+ tau−, so it's a pair.

So the correct answer must include all those fermions except the ones that are too heavy, like b quark.

So let me check the options again.

Option A: includes b and s, u, d, tau, e, but since b is too heavy, A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay channels depend on the fermion masses. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

The masses of the fermions are approximately:

- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, excluded)
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with masses \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)) are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). Therefore, the allowed decay channels of \( X \) are \( X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. This matches the correct decay channels.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is excluded because the top quark is too heavy. Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, D is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \).
