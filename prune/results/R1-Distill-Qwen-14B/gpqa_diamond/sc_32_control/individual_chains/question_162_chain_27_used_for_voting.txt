Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think through this.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh right, and the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere... I remember that in the context of relativity, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Or wait, maybe it's a hyperbolic space? Or is it an example of a space with negative curvature?

Wait, the area... So I need to compute the area of this space, perhaps? Or is it the area of a specific object, like a sphere with a certain radius? Hmm, the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'. So maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface? Or perhaps it's a higher-dimensional object; no, the metric is 2D because it's in dx and dy.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, but it's scaled by a factor. Let me write it down:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, that denominator looks familiar. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So that's like 4 minus (x² + y²) = 4 - r², where r is the radial coordinate in 2D. So this is like a 2D metric where the 'radius' is such that r² = x² + y², right?

Wait, so if that's the case, then the denominator 4 - r². So when r² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up. So that must be a point where the space ends, perhaps. Like a boundary.

Now, the area of a pseudosphere... but wait, in 2D, the area would be calculated using the metric. Since it's a 2D metric, the area would be the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the region. But since it's conformally flat (the metric is a scalar multiple of the flat metric), the determinant is just the square of the conformal factor. So the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric is only two-dimensional, so the determinant g is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy² if the off-diagonal terms are zero. Since this metric is diagonal, because there's no cross terms (like dxdy), the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]^2, but wait no, each term is multiplied by that scalar. So the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32/(4 - r²)] = [32/(4 - r²)]². So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, but wait, the area of the entire space would require integrating this over all x and y where the metric is defined. So the domain where 4 - x² - y² is positive, because the denominator can't be zero or negative (since the metric would be undefined or imaginary if it's negative). So 4 - r² > 0 implies r² < 4, so r < 2. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but wait. The area would be the integral over x and y of sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So the area would be the integral over the disk (r < 2) of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. Let's switch to polar coordinates because that seems easier.

So in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the area A is ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral.

First, the integral over θ from 0 to 2π is straightforward; it's 2π. So A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral: ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. Wait, so r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 * (-du/2) ) / u ].

Simplify: 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

But the integral of 1/u du is ln|u|, so evaluating from 4 to 0:

-16 [ln(0) - ln(4)].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this becomes -16 [ (-infinity) - ln4 ) ] → -16 ( -infinity ) → positive infinity.

Wait, so the integral is divergent. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake in substitution?

Wait, let me check again. The substitution: u =4 -r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ 32 r dr / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ]

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du. The negative flips the limits, so:

= 32 * (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du → 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

Ah! Wait, because ∫ (a to b) f(x) dx = -∫ (b to a) f(x) dx. So ∫ (4 to 0) f(u) du = - ∫ (0 to4) f(u) du.

So in this case, the integral is:

32 * (-1/2) * [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

Hmm, let me do it again. So the substitution:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r dr / (4 - r²)].

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (r dr) = - du/2.

So the integral becomes:

32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

Now, the limits: when r=0 → u=4; when r=2 → u=0.

So the integral is 32*(-1/2) [ ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (1/u) du ].

Which is -16 [ ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ].

Wait, ln(0) is -infinity, ln(4) is a finite number. So this becomes:

-16 [ (ln(0) - ln(4)) ] = -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] = -16 [ -infty - ln4 ].

Wait, this becomes positive infinity because -infty multiplied by negative. So the integral is approaching infinity. So the area A is 2π multiplied by this integral, which is infinite. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but why? The space described by this metric is a 2D surface. If the area is infinite, that would mean the space has infinite area. So looking back at the options, option D is +infinity. So that would be the answer.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? For example, in 2D, the metric of a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic plane) is usually expressed in isothermal coordinates as ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ², but that's not exactly the same as what's given here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is a representation of a pseudosphere, but in this case, the area is infinite because the space extends infinitely. But wait, in the given metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So that suggests that the maximum radius is 2, beyond which the metric becomes singular. So the space is only defined within a circle of radius 2. So perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, but wait. If the space is only defined up to r=2, then the area would be finite because the region is the disk of radius 2. But the integral we did showed that the area is infinite. Because when approaching r=2, the metric blows up, so the area element becomes infinite near the edge.

So that would mean the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the radius. The radius of curvature for a pseudosphere is related to its geometry. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative, K = -1/a², where a is the curvature radius. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a 2D space with a specific curvature, and the area being infinite suggests that the pseudosphere has infinite area, which would make sense since a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Wait, but the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, so yes, its area is infinite. So if this metric represents a hyperbolic plane, then the area would be infinite. But in this case, the metric is only defined for r <2, but in reality, a pseudosphere (as a hyperbolic plane) is infinitely extended, but perhaps the given metric is a model on a disk, like the Poincaré disk model, which is conformally flat and has the metric ds² = 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks similar but not exactly the same as the given metric.

Wait, the given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me compare with the Poincaré disk model. The standard Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), but in isothermal coordinates, it's usually written as ds² = 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²), where x² + y² < 1.

Hmm, the given metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me factor out the 4 in the denominator. So denominator becomes 4*(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ). So the metric is 32/(4*(1 - r²/4)) (dx² + dy²) → (8)/(1 - r²/4) (dx² + dy²), where r² =x² + y².

So that's 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dx² + dy²).

Which can be written as 8/(1 - (r²/(4))) (dx² + dy²).

But the Poincaré metric is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²) when r is scaled appropriately. Wait, perhaps the given metric is a scaled version. Let me see: Let me make a substitution. Let r' = r/2. So r = 2 r'. Then r² =4 r'². Let me substitute into the denominator: 4 - r² =4 (1 - r'^2).

So the metric becomes 32 / [4(1 - r'^2)] (dx² + dy²) → 8/(1 - r'^2) (dx² + dy²).

So in terms of r', the metric is 8/(1 - r'^2) (dx² + dy²).

Which can be written as 8 (dx² + dy²) / (1 - r'^2).

Hmm. The standard Poincaré disk model is 4/(1 - r'^2)^2 (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2). So not exactly the same, but perhaps this is a different model.

Wait, perhaps the metric given isn't the Poincaré model but another conformal metric. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metric with a different curvature. Let me compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to see.

The Gaussian curvature K for a conformally flat metric ds² = E² (dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2 E)) Δ (ln E), where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space. But perhaps another approach is better. Alternatively, for a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 r)) d/dr (r f(r)^2) ).

Wait, perhaps I should compute it for the given metric.

Wait, in this case, the metric is in 2D, and in polar coordinates, which would be more convenient for computing curvature.

So, let me write the metric in polar coordinates. Since x² + y² = r², so dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So in polar coordinates, the metric is g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²).

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ² is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ d/dr (r (A(r) - B(r))) ) ].

Wait, I think another formula is more accurate. Alternatively, the formula for Gaussian curvature in 2D for polar coordinates (assuming only r and θ components) is:

K = - (1/(2 A)) [ (d/dr ( (A B) )) / r ) + (d/dr (A)) / r ) ].

Wait, perhaps a better formula is:

The Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 sqrt(A B))) [ (d/dr (sqrt(A B))) / r + (d/dθ (sqrt(A B)) ) / r ) ].

But since in our case, the metric is independent of θ, the second term (d/dθ) would be zero. So:

K = - (1/(2 sqrt(A B))) [ (d/dr (sqrt(A B)) ) / r ].

Wait, perhaps I can look for another approach. Alternatively, the Gaussian curvature K of a metric ds² = a(r) dr² + b(r) dθ² is given by:

K = [ (b')/(2 a) ] - [ (a' b) / (2 a²) ) ].

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make sure I have the correct formula. For a metric in polar coordinates, ds² = A dr² + B r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = [ (B - A) + r (A' / A - B'/(r² B)) ) ] / (2 A B).

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the Ricci scalar. Since in 2D, the Ricci scalar is equivalent to the Gaussian curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler formula. For a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r)) d/dr [ r (f'(r)/f(r) ) ].

Wait, but let me perhaps use the formula for the Gaussian curvature when the metric is conformally flat. So, in conformal coordinates, where the metric is ds² = e^{2 φ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ² ), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - e^{-2 φ} [ (dφ/dr)² + d² φ/dr² ].

Wait, or maybe I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, another approach: in 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = [ (f''(r) ) + (f'(r)/r) ] / f(r).

Wait, let me try computing this for our metric.

Wait, in our case, the metric in polar coordinates is:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

So, f(r)² = 32/(4 - r²).

So f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) ) = (sqrt(32)) / sqrt(4 - r²) ) = (4 sqrt(2)) / sqrt(4 - r²).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the metric as ds² = a(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where a(r)^2 = 32/(4 - r²).

So a(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) = (4 sqrt(2)) / sqrt(4 - r²).

Now, the formula for Gaussian curvature K when the metric is ds² = a(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²) is:

K = [ (a'(r) ) / a(r) ) * (1/r) ) ] + [ (a'(r) )^2 / (a(r)^2) ) ].

Wait, I'm not confident about this formula. Let me double-check. Another approach is to compute the Christoffel symbols and then the Ricci scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = a(r)^2 dr² + b(r)^2 dθ², where in this case, a(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)), and b(r) = r sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates is:

K = [ (b' - a') / (r a b) ) ] + [ (a' ) / (r a^2) ) ].

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should look for a more systematic way.

Wait, another approach is to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula:

K = - (1/(2)) (g_rr'' + g_θθ'' - g_rθ')/(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ^2 ),

but since the metric is diagonal (g_rθ =0), this simplifies.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the Christoffel symbols, then the Ricci scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for a conformal metric. Since the metric is conformally flat, with conformal factor f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

In 2D, the Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric with ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²) is given by:

K = - (e^{-2φ} ) [ φ_{,rr} + φ_{,θθ} + φ_{,r}/r ].

But in polar coordinates, since the metric is in terms of r and θ, and assuming φ depends only on r, then φ_{,θθ} =0. So,

K = - e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + (φ' )/r ].

In our case, φ(r) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

So φ'(r) = (0) - (1/2) [ (-2 r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = (r)/(4 - r²).

φ''(r) = [ (4 - r²)(1) + r (2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2 ) → [ (4 - r²) + 2 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2 → (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, wait. Let's compute that again.

φ(r) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

So φ'(r) = derivative of (-1/2 ln(4 - r²)) = (-1/2) * [ (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = r/(4 - r²).

Now, φ''(r) is derivative of r/(4 - r²).

Using quotient rule:

d/dr [r/(4 - r²)] = [ (1)(4 - r²) + r (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

= [4 - r² + 2 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2 → [4 + r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

So now, plugging into the Gaussian curvature formula:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + φ' / r ].

Compute e^{-2φ}:

e^{-2φ} = e^{ -2 [ (1/2 ln32) - (1/2 ln(4 - r²)) ] }.

= e^{ - ln(32) + ln(4 - r²) } → (4 - r²)/32.

So,

K = - ( (4 - r²)/32 ) [ (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2 + (r/(4 - r²)) / r ].

Simplify the terms inside the brackets:

First term: (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Second term: (r/(4 - r²)) / r = 1/(4 - r²).

So,

K = - ( (4 - r²)/32 ) [ (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2 + 1/(4 - r²) ]

= - ( (4 - r²)/32 ) [ (4 + r²) + (4 - r²) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Because the second term is 1/(4 - r²) = (4 - r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So adding the numerators:

(4 + r²) + (4 - r²) ) = 8.

So,

K = - ( (4 - r²)/32 ) [ 8 / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

= - ( (4 - r²) * 8 ) / (32 (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

8 /32 = 1/4.

(4 - r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) = 1/(4 - r²).

So,

K = - (1/4) * [ 1/(4 - r²) ) ] * 8 ?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute:

Wait, after the brackets evaluation, we have [8 / (4 - r²)^2 ].

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²) * 8 ] / [ 32 (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

= - [8 (4 - r²) ) ] / [32 (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

8/32 = 1/4.

(4 - r²) / (4 - r²)^2 = 1/(4 - r²).

So,

K = - (1/4) * [1/(4 - r²) ) ] → K = -1/(4 (4 - r²)).

Hmm, but that's interesting. So the Gaussian curvature depends on r, which suggests that this is not a space of constant curvature. Wait, but a pseudosphere is supposed to have constant negative curvature. So perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere, but the question says it is. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the metric in a more convenient form. Let me define a new variable. Let me say that r' = r/2. So r = 2 r'; when r=2, r'=1.

Then, the denominator 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r')² ), and the metric becomes:

ds² = 32/(4 (1 - (r')² )) ( dr² + (2 r')² dθ² )

= 8/(1 - (r')² ) ( dr² + 4 (r')² dθ² )

Hmm, perhaps that's not leading me anywhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the area again.

Wait, earlier I found that the area integral diverges, giving an infinite area. So the answer is option D, +infinite.

But wait, the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π (x² + y²)

C)4π (x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the only option that makes sense is D, +infty.

But wait, wait. The question says 'the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2'. So perhaps the area is finite, and I made a mistake in calculating the integral.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the metric given is that of a sphere with positive curvature, but the question is about a pseudosphere, which would have negative curvature, hence infinite area. But in this case, the metric seems to represent a space that is finite in area because it's bounded by r=2, but the integral suggests otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is 4π r², but with r=2, that would be 16π, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So looking again, the only option that makes sense with my integral leading to infinity is option D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we use the metric to determine the area element. Since the metric is conformally flat, the area element is proportional to the conformal factor. In polar coordinates (\( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, \( g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2 \). Thus, \( \sqrt{g} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \).

The total area is obtained by integrating \( dA \) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) implies that \( r < 2 \), so the integration is performed over the disk \( 0 \leq r \leq 2 \) and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi \). Switching to polar coordinates, the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \) is straightforward. The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \frac{-du}{2} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a constant value for the area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the integral diverges, indicating an infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

**Answer: D**
