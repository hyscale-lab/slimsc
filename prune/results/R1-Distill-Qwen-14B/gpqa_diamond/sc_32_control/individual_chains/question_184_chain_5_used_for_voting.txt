Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reaction sequence to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize where the substituents are. The benzene ring has three groups: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. Wait, actually, numbering in benzene derivatives is a bit tricky. Let me think—when numbering, the substituents should get the lowest possible numbers. So the nitro group is at position 1, ethoxy at 2, and tert-butyl at 3? Or maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in some order. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement? I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Alternatively, maybe the positions are 1,2,3 but in a way that they are adjacent? No, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent in a row. Hmm, maybe the substituents are meta to each other but let's not get stuck on that right now.

The key is to figure out the order of reactions to add these substituents. Because each substituent is introduced through a different reaction, and the order will affect where they attach based on directing effects.

Benzene is the starting material. The substituents we need to add are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

I remember that nitro groups are meta-directing, strong deactivating groups. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating, but also ortho/para-directing group because it's an alkyl group.

Wait, but tert-butyl is a strong activating group since it's an alkyl substituent. Wait, no—actually, tert-butyl is a bulky group, but it's a strong activating group because it's an electron-donating group. Wait, no: wait, alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through induction (they're slightly electron-releasing due to their +I effect). So, they are activating and ortho/para directors.

The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, when adding substituents, the order in which they are introduced affects where the next substituent goes.

So, thinking about the sequence: if I first add a nitro group, then when adding the next group (like ethoxy or tert-butyl), the nitro group will direct meta. Then, adding the next substituent would depend on the directing effects of the existing groups.

Alternatively, if I first add an activating group like ethoxy, that would make the ring more reactive and direct the next incoming group to ortho or para positions.

Wait, but the target molecule has all three substituents. So, perhaps the strategy is to add the substituents in an order where each step can be directed properly, considering the prior substituents.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Introduce the first substituent.
2. Introduce the second substituent, considering the directing effects of the first.
3. Introduce the third substituent, considering the directing effects of the first two.

But wait, there are three substituents, so the order of introduction matters. Let's think about the possible orders:

Option 1: Add the nitro group first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

But wait, nitro is meta-directing. So after nitro is added, adding ethoxy would go meta to nitro. Then adding the tert-butyl would be directed by both nitro and ethoxy.

But wait, the nitro is deactivating, so the next substitution would be difficult. Wait, no, after adding nitro, the ring is less reactive, but activating groups can be added. Hmm, maybe not the best order.

Option 2: Add ethoxy first. Ethoxy is activating, so next substituent would be directed by ethoxy. Then, add nitro. Since nitro is meta to the ethoxy, that could be a possibility. Then, adding the tert-butyl would have to consider the directing effects of both ethoxy and nitro.

But wait, after adding nitro, the ring would have two substituents: ethoxy and nitro. The next substituent (tert-butyl) would be directed by the existing substituents. But Nitro is meta-directing and deactivating, while ethoxy is ortho/para-directing and activating.

So when adding a third substituent, the positions would be influenced by all existing groups. It's a bit complicated, but perhaps the order can be chosen so that each substituent is added in a way that doesn't interfere too much.

Another approach: maybe the nitro group is added last because nitration requires a strongly activated ring, but wait, nitro is deactivating. Alternatively, if we add the activating groups first, the ring remains more reactive for the next steps.

Wait, perhaps the order is to add the ethoxy first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Let me see:

After adding ethoxy, the ring is activated and ortho/para to ethoxy. Then adding tert-butyl would go ortho/para to ethoxy, but also considering any other existing substituents. Wait, there's only ethoxy in the ring.

So, adding tert-butyl would go in either ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, when adding nitro, the ring has ethoxy and tert-butyl. Nitro is a strong meta director. So the nitro would go meta to ethoxy and/or tert-butyl, but that might not give the desired position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Let's see:

Adding tert-butyl first: the ring has a bulky group, which is activating. Next, add ethoxy. Ethoxy is activating, so it would go ortho or para to tert-butyl. Then add nitro. Nitro is a meta director. But after ethoxy is added, the ring has both tert-butyl and ethoxy. The nitration would be directed by the dominant group.

Wait, but activating groups are ortho/para directors, and deactivating (like nitro) are meta. But here, in this case, the nitration is the last step. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the order is nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added second. Like, first ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Wait, let's think of the target structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So, for benzene, the substituents are adjacent. So perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). But wait, is that possible? Because in that case, the nitro is adjacent to the ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing, so if I add nitro after ethoxy, it would go meta to ethoxy. So perhaps the positions would be ethoxy at position 1, nitro at position 3, and then tert-butyl would have to go in position 2? But how does that happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to add the ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl. Let's see:

1. Benzene → nitration: but wait, adding nitro first. But if I add nitro first, the ring becomes deactivating. Then adding ethoxy second: but ethoxy is activating. Nitro is meta directing, so ethoxy would go meta to nitro. Then adding tert-butyl would need to go where?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the directing effects. Let me break it down.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents in adjacent positions.

Wait, that's not possible because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, forming a trio of adjacent positions. So the substituents are each next to each other. But each substituent directs the next one.

Wait, perhaps the order of addition is nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. Let's see:

1. Benzene → nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). So we get nitrobenzene. Nitro is at position 1.

2. Nitrobenzene → nitration again? No, we need ethoxy next. So, to add ethoxy, we can perform an etherification. Wait, to make ethoxybenzene, you can use ethyl chloride with AlCl3 as a catalyst, but wait, nitro is a meta director. So, adding ethoxy would go meta to nitro. So in nitrobenzene, adding ethoxy would be at position 3 or 4? Wait, in nitrobenzene, the ethoxy would go para or ortho to the nitro? Wait, no, nitro is a meta director, so when adding ethoxy, it would go meta to nitro. So if nitro is at position 1, ethoxy would be at position 3 or 4? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So position 1, the meta positions would be 3 and 5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the substituents as follows: Let's say the nitro is at position 3. Then, ethoxy would be added at position 1 (meta to nitro). Then, the tert-butyl can go at position 2.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Wait, let's think.

If I first add ethoxy to benzene, I get ethoxybenzene. Then, nitration would add a nitro group in the meta position relative to ethoxy. So nitro would be at position 3 (assuming ethoxy is at 1). Then, adding tert-butyl would have to go ortho or para to ethoxy. Hmm.

Wait, ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3. Now, adding tert-butyl. The ring now has ethoxy (1) and nitro (3) groups. The next substituent, tert-butyl, would be directed by the existing groups. Ethoxy is ortho/para director, nitro is meta. So where would the tert-butyl go?

In this case, the existing groups would direct the next substituent. Since ethoxy is activating and ortho/para, it would direct incoming groups to its ortho and para positions. Nitro is deactivating and meta, so it would direct incoming groups to its meta positions.

So, looking at the available positions:

- Ethoxy is at 1. Its ortho positions are 2 and 6. Para is 4.

- Nitro is at 3. Its meta positions would be 6 and 1 (but 1 is already occupied by ethoxy), so 6 and 1 are meta to nitro.

So, position 2 is ortho to ethoxy, position 4 is para to ethoxy, and position 6 is meta to nitro and ortho to ethoxy.

But position 6 is already occupied by ethoxy's ortho position. Wait, no, ethoxy is at 1; position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so it's ortho to ethoxy.

When adding tert-butyl, which is a strong activating group, the ring is probably activated or deactived? Wait, after adding ethoxy and nitro, the ring is a mix. Nitro is deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive. But ethoxy is activating, making the ring more reactive. So overall, how reactive is the ring?

But regardless, the directing effects are key. Since ethoxy is activating, it will probably dominate in directing the next substitution. So, tert-butyl would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

So, possible positions: 2,4.

But position 4 is para to ethoxy (position 1). Position 2 is ortho to ethoxy.

But nitro is at position 3. So, adding tert-butyl at position 2 would be adjacent to nitro (position 3), which is possible.

So, the structure would have nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

That would give 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which is the target.

So the order of steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add nitro group.

3. Add tert-butyl group.

Wait, but wait: adding tert-butyl after ethoxy and nitro. Let me think about the reactions.

Wait, adding ethoxy to benzene: that's an electrophilic substitution. Using ethyl chloride and AlCl3 as catalyst would be Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait—Friedel-Crafts doesn’t work for ethyl chloride because ethyl is a primary alkyl chloride, which tends to undergo carbocation rearrangement. So ethoxy is an activating group, but how is it added? Oh, wait, to make ethoxybenzene, you can't use Friedel-Crafts because benzene is not activated enough. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution or another method. Wait, no—nucleophilic aromatic substitution is tricky and usually requires strongly activated rings.

Wait, perhaps the correct method to add ethoxy group is via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually for more activated rings, like when there's a strong directing group already present.

Hmmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the ethoxy group is added via a different method. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nitration followed by some other steps.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about each reaction step in the options.

Looking at the options A, B, C, D:

Each option lists a sequence of reactions, starting from benzene. I need to see which sequence correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), but I'm not certain about the numbering.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Because tert-butyl is a bulky group, maybe it's added first as a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Then, ethoxy is added in a position ortho or para to it. Then, nitro is added in a position that's meta to ethoxy.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene is not very reactive. So to add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, we'd need to have an activating group already present. But since we're starting with benzene, perhaps Friedel-Crafts isn't the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl is added after another substituent has been introduced to activate the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first add a nitro group, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. Let me think about each step:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Ethoxylation: how to add ethoxy to nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director. So ethoxy would add to the meta position relative to nitro. So if nitro is at position 1, ethoxy would be at position 3.

3. Then, adding tert-butyl. Now, the ring has nitro (1) and ethoxy (3). The tert-butyl would be directed by both groups.

Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing, ethoxy is activating and ortho/para-directing. So, which group directs where?

In a ring with multiple substituents, the most powerful director takes precedence. Activating groups are usually stronger directors than deactivating. So ethoxy would direct the tert-butyl to ortho or para positions relative to itself (position 3). So possible positions for tert-butyl would be 2 or 4 (ortho and para to ethoxy at 3). But position 4 is across from ethoxy, but considering the nitro at 1, maybe 4 is not possible because of steric or electronic reasons. Alternatively, position 2 would be adjacent to nitro (position 1). That might be possible.

Wait, but adding tert-butyl in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation after nitro and ethoxy. But wait, nitro is deactivating, which would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So perhaps that's a problem. Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, so if the ring is deactivated by nitro, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts might not work.

So perhaps adding tert-butyl first is not possible because the ring is not activated enough. So maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, and then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene? Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't feasible for benzene without an activating group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method. For example, using a side chain alkylation, but that's usually for toluene derivatives. Alternatively, maybe using a sulfonic acid group as a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Add nitro group (nitration) → nitrobenzene.

2. Then, do something to make the ring more activated so ethoxy can be added. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so that might not be easy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly activated ring, perhaps with a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

First, add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But for that, the ring must be activated. Benzene isn't activated, so maybe that's not possible. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after introducing a good leaving group. For example, if we have a nitro group meta to a sulfonic acid group, which can be a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce a sulfonic acid group in a position that would allow substitution. For example, if nitro is at position 3, perhaps sulfonic acid is introduced at position 4.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a nitro group and a good leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via an etherification reaction, but I'm not certain about the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), v) dilute H2SO4 (heating?), vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis?), vii) NaOH/EtBr (Finkelstein?), viii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?)

This seems a bit all over the place. But let's think.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration), v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis?), vii) NaOH/EtBr (Finkelstein?), viii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), ix) dilute H2SO4.

Not sure. Also, multiple nitration steps.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), vi) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration), vii) H3O+, H2O/heat (hydrolysis?), viii) dilute H2SO4, ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine?

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → Finkelstein, perhaps.

Hmm. Let's think about the correct order.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the ethoxy group first. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add nitro, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each substituent's reaction.

The ethoxy group is typically added via a substitution reaction, perhaps. Or via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation after activating the ring with another group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The nitro group is a strong meta director and deactivating, so perhaps it's added last. Because if it's added first, it deactivates the ring, making it difficult to add the other groups.

So, maybe the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy first.

2. Add tert-butyl.

3. Add nitro group.

But how to add ethoxy first?

Wait, ethoxy can be added via a substitution reaction if we have a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps using a side chain method.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a nitro group as a meta director.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reactions in the options.

Looking at option D: the first step is nitration. So after that, we have nitrobenzene. Then, step ii is Fe/HCl, which is a catalyst for some reaction, perhaps reduction. Wait, Fe/HCl is often used for catalytic hydrogenation, but more commonly, Fe is used with HCl for other purposes. Alternatively, Fe/HCl can be used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So, if nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline, but that's a possibility.

But then step iii is adding tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3. So Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But after nitro is reduced to amine, which is a strong activating group. So if aniline is formed, then adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would be possible.

Wait, but aniline is a strong activating group, so the next substitution would be directed by it.

So, step by step for option D:

i) Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduces nitro to NH2 group → aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl is added to aniline. Where does it add? Aniline is strongly activating and ortho/para directing. So tert-butyl would add ortho or para to the amine group.

Assuming the nitro was at position 1, after reduction, amine is at 1. So adding tert-butyl would go to position 2 or 4.

Then, step iv is another nitration. Now, the ring has amine (1) and tert-butyl (2 or 4). Nitration is a meta director. So where would the nitro go?

If the tert-butyl is at 2, then the amine is at 1. Nitration would be directed by the amine (activating, ortho/para) and the tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So possible positions: 3,5,6.

But wait, the target requires nitro at position 3. So maybe in this case, the nitro would go to position 3.

So after step iv, the structure would have amine (1), tert-butyl (2), and nitro (3).

Then, step v is NaNO2/HCl: diazotization, which converts amine to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation? Or perhaps another reaction.

Wait, maybe after diazotization, step vi would be some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis step.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, step vi could be hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol under acidic conditions. But then, step vii is dilute H2SO4, perhaps for heating.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So where does the ethoxy come in?

In option D, after steps i to iv, we have nitro at 3, amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Then step v is diazotization, which would convert the amine to a diazonium salt. Then, step vi is SO3/H2SO4, which is sulfonation. That would add a sulfonic acid group. Then step vii is dilute H2SO4, maybe for heating. Then, step viii is H3O+ and H2O with heat, which could be hydrolysis. Then, step ix is NaOH and EtBr, which is a nucleophilic substitution (Finkelstein), perhaps replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

But I'm not following this clearly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is adding ethoxy via hydrolysis of a diazonium salt.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group could be introduced via a diazonium salt's hydrolysis. For example, if a benzene ring has a diazonium salt, hydrolysis under acidic conditions would give a phenol, and under basic conditions could give an ether.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction where a nitro group is replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduction of nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl.

4. Nitration again → add nitro group.

5. Diazotization and substitution to introduce ethoxy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let's see:

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. Since amine is strongly activating, tert-butyl would add ortho or para to amine. Let's say ortho at 2.

Step iv: nitration. Now, with amine (1) and tert-butyl (2), the next nitration would be directed by the amine. So nitro would go to position 4 (para to amine) or position 3 (ortho to amine and meta to tert-butyl). Hmm, but amine is a strong director, so nitration would likely go para to amine, which is position 4.

But the target requires nitro at position 3. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iv would be directed by the tert-butyl group. Tert-butyl is an activating group, so it would direct ortho and para. So, possible positions after having amine (1) and tert-butyl (2) are 3,4,5,6.

But since amine is a strong director, the nitration would probably go para to amine, which is position 4. So nitro at 4, which is not desired.

So this would not give the target structure. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Let me look at option B.

Option B steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts t-butyl → add tert-butyl to benzene. But benzene isn't activated, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. So perhaps this step is not feasible. So option B may not be correct.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts t-butyl → same problem as B.

So perhaps the correct approach is to first add ethoxy, then nitro, then t-butyl.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene? Because Friedel-Crafts isn't feasible without an activating group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after introducing a strong electron-withdrawing group, like nitro.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. Let me think:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce a leaving group, like a nitro group at a certain position, then substitute with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps use a sulfonic acid group as a leaving group.

Wait, another method: use a diazonium salt to introduce a substituent. For example, if you have a diazonium salt, you can perform a substitution reaction.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

But without an activating group, ethoxy can't be added via Friedel-Crafts. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a different route.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group, like an amino group.

So, perhaps the steps would be:

1. Add amino group via nitration and reduction.

2. Then, perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add ethoxy. Wait, no, ethoxy is an ether, not an alkyl halide.

Wait, perhaps use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction, such as using a side chain. For example, toluene can be converted to benzene with ethoxy by introducing a substituent and then substituting.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think about each option's steps for option B.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts t-butyl: assuming this adds t-butyl to benzene, which may not be feasible because benzene is not activated. But maybe in reality, it's possible if we use a suitable catalyst.

Assuming step i gives t-butylbenzene.

Step ii: nitration → nitro group added. Since t-butyl is activating and ortho/para directing, nitro would be at position 2 or 4 relative to t-butyl.

Assuming t-butyl is at position 1, nitro could be at 2 or 4.

Step iii: Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine. So nitro at, say, position 2 becomes amine at 2.

Now the ring has t-butyl (1) and amine (2).

Step iv: nitration → nitro added. Amine is activating and ortho/para. So nitro would go to position 3 or 6 (ortho to amine) or position 5 (para to amine).

Assuming it goes to position 3.

So now, substituents are t-butyl (1), amine (2), nitro (3).

Step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amine to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: H3O+ and H2O with heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol.

So now, substituents are t-butyl (1), phenol (2), nitro (3).

Step vii: NaOH/EtBr → Finkelstein reaction, but here, perhaps to introduce ethoxy. Wait, but Finkelstein is for halides. Maybe this step replaces a leaving group with ethoxy. But where?

Wait, if there's a phenol group at 2, perhaps it can be converted into an ether. For example, treating a phenol with a good leaving group and then performing an SN2 reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this step is introducing ethoxy via some other means.

Step viii: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

Step ix: dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. I'm not sure if this would lead to the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I might be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduction to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl → t-butyl is added to ortho/para.

4. Nitration → add nitro in meta to ethoxy.

Wait, but how does ethoxy get added?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after forming a diazonium salt.

Wait, maybe after nitration and reduction, we have aniline. Then, adding ethoxy via some method.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the order where the nitro group is added last, and the other groups are activating, making the ring reactive enough for nitration.

In the target molecule, the substituents are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para), and nitro (deactivating, meta). So, perhaps the nitro is added last, after the ring is activated by the other two groups.

So the order would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add tert-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy and tert-butyl in the first two steps.

Adding ethoxy first: perhaps via Friedel-Crafts alkylation is not possible because benzene isn't activated. So perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with another group.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should consider the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts (if possible) → t-butylbenzene.

ii) nitration → nitro added at position 2 or 4.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) nitration → another nitro group?

But this seems to add more nitro groups than needed.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction to aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → Finkelstein.

Hmm. Let me think step by step.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. Since amine is activating, t-butyl would go ortho or para. Let's say para: position 4.

Now, substituents are amine (1), t-butyl (4).

Step iv: nitration. Now, with amine (1) and t-butyl (4), both activating and ortho/para directors. Where would nitro go?

Amine is a strong director, so nitro would go ortho or para to amine. But position 2 is ortho to amine (1), and position 4 is already occupied by t-butyl. So para would be position 4, which is taken. So nitro would go to position 2.

So substituents are amine (1), t-butyl (4), nitro (2).

Step v: diazotization → convert amine to diazonium chloride.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Adding a sulfonic acid group. Where? The ring has nitro (2), amine (1, now as diazonium), and t-butyl (4). Sulfonation is typically directed by deactivating groups, so nitro would direct meta, which would be position 5 or 6.

But in this case, the ring has the diazonium group, which is a strong deactivating group. So sulfonation would occur meta to the diazonium group, which is at 1. So positions 3 or 5.

But I'm not sure.

After sulfonation, step vii is dilute H2SO4, maybe for sulfonation.

Step viii: H3O+ and H2O with heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol. So now, substituents are phenol (1), t-butyl (4), nitro (2), and sulfonic acid (say, 3).

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → Finkelstein, which would substitute a halide with ethoxy. But where's the halide?

Wait, perhaps previous steps introduced a leaving group that can be replaced with ethoxy. But I'm not seeing it.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of this differently.

Another approach: the target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro substituents. The nitro group is meta to ethoxy. The tert-butyl is either ortho or para to ethoxy.

So perhaps the sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy first. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction after adding tert-butyl and nitro.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl → t-butylbenzene.

2. Add nitro → directed meta to tert-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy → directed ortho or para to nitro.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add nitro.

2. Add tert-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy.

But again, I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option D again.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-butyl added to aniline.

iv) Nitration → add another nitro group.

v) Diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → Finkelstein.

Wait, perhaps after step iii, we have aniline (1) and t-butyl (2). Then, step iv adds nitro at position 3 (meta to the t-butyl).

But wait, nitro is a meta director. So when adding nitro to aniline (1), which is an activating group, the nitro would go ortho or para to aniline. But if there's also a t-butyl group at 2, which is an activating group, the nitration could be directed by either.

Hmm. If aniline is at 1 and t-butyl at 2, then when adding nitro, the possible positions are 3 (ortho to t-butyl), 4 (para to aniline).

But since aniline is a strong activating group, nitration would prefer to go para to aniline, which is position 4. But the target requires nitro at position 3.

So perhaps option D is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after steps in D, some rearrangement happens, but I'm not seeing it.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the order of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of the aromatic ring. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The sequence of reactions must ensure that each substituent is added in a position consistent with the desired structure.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: This step involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group. However, benzene is not sufficiently activated for this reaction to proceed efficiently without a pre-existing activating group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group. However, the tert-butyl group is bulky and may sterically hinder the nitration process.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target molecule.
4. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts an amine to a diazonium salt, but no amine is present at this stage.
5. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to form a phenol is not relevant here.
6. **NaOH/EtBr**: This step involves a Finkelstein reaction, but no halide is present to replace with ethoxy.
7. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine is not consistent with the desired synthesis.
8. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Additional nitration is unnecessary and could lead to multiple nitro groups.

This sequence does not align with the target structure and introduces unnecessary steps.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group. However, benzene is not activated, making this step inefficient.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group. The tert-butyl group is ortho/para-directing, so the nitro group would likely occupy the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl group.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine is not consistent with the target molecule.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Additional nitration is unnecessary and could lead to multiple nitro groups.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts an amine to a diazonium salt, but no amine is present at this stage.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to form a phenol is not relevant here.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: This step involves a Finkelstein reaction, but no halide is present to replace with ethoxy.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target molecule.
9. **dilute H₂SO₄**: This step does not contribute to the desired synthesis.

This sequence introduces unnecessary steps and does not produce the target structure.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group. However, benzene is not activated, making this step inefficient.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target molecule.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group. The tert-butyl group is ortho/para-directing, so the nitro group would likely occupy the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl group.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine is not consistent with the target molecule.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts an amine to a diazonium salt, but no amine is present at this stage.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Additional nitration is unnecessary and could lead to multiple nitro groups.
7. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to form a phenol is not relevant here.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: This step does not contribute to the desired synthesis.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: This step involves a Finkelstein reaction, but no halide is present to replace with ethoxy.

This sequence introduces unnecessary steps and does not produce the target structure.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group at position 1, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine, forming aniline.
3. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group. The amine is a strong ortho/para director, so the tert-butyl group would occupy the ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) position relative to the amine.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a second nitro group. The amine and tert-butyl group are both ortho/para directors, but the nitro group is added at position 3 (meta to the tert-butyl group and ortho to the amine).
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amine to a diazonium salt.
6. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target molecule.
7. **dilute H₂SO₄**: This step does not contribute to the desired synthesis.
8. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt forms a phenol, but this step is not necessary for the target structure.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: This step involves a Finkelstein reaction, but no halide is present to replace with ethoxy.

This sequence partially aligns with the target structure but introduces unnecessary steps and does not successfully produce the ethoxy group.

### Conclusion:
None of the options provide a complete and correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. However, based on the analysis, **Option D** comes closest to the desired sequence, despite introducing unnecessary steps and failing to successfully add the ethoxy group.
