Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but let me think through this.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry entails. Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that passes through the axis. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Looking at the options, I've got four molecules. Let me go through each one:

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran-...hexaone. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. The structure might have multiple rings, maybe some sort of bridged system. Wait, triphenylene is a tricyclic compound, and if it's connected to trifuran, which is a ring with three oxygen atoms (like a tricyclic furan derivative?), the molecule might have a symmetrical arrangement. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees, that could give a C3 rotation. Also, if there's a mirror plane cutting through, that could give the h component. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-...hexaone. The benzo part suggests a benzene ring fused with the trifuran. Benzo rings can have certain symmetries. Wait, benzo[...]trifuran—like how benzofuran is a fused benzene and furan. So this molecule is a trifuran with benzo rings attached. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees, maybe it has a C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? I'm not certain. Maybe if the structure is symmetric across a plane, but I'm not sure if it's a horizontal one.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate is [B(OiPr)3], where iPr is isopropyl. The borate ion has a trigonal planar structure, right? So the three isopropyl groups are attached to boron. That would make it a trigonal planar molecule, which has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane (so a three-fold rotation). But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. So the molecule is flat, with three identical groups around the boron. A horizontal mirror plane would be in the plane of the molecule. That mirror plane would reflect each isopropyl group onto another. So yes, that would make sense. Thus, C3h symmetry. Because it has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane in the same plane.

Wait, but wait, I think triisopropyl borate has each isopropyl group arranged in a trigonal planar around boron. So the molecule is flat, with a plane of symmetry passing through the boron and each pair of isopropyl groups. So that would have a C3 axis (perpendicular to the plane) and a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the molecule). So that would be C3h, right?

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a bridge between two rings. Its structure is like a cube with a bridge, so it's sometimes called the "cube-shaped" amine. The structure has a three-fold axis, I think. Wait, quinuclidine has a bridge that gives it a certain symmetry. Let me think. The molecule has a chair-like structure, and I believe it has a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. If the molecule is symmetric across a horizontal plane, then yes. Wait, quinuclidine is a meso compound, so it has a plane of symmetry. The plane would pass through the bridge, right? So yes, it has a mirror plane. So quinuclidine has C3 symmetry and a mirror plane, which would make it C3h. Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Quinuclidine has a three-membered bridge, so the main structure is a bridged bicyclic system. The molecule is symmetric across a plane that includes the bridge. So if you rotate it 120 degrees around the bridge axis, it would look the same. And there's a mirror plane through the bridge, which is a horizontal plane. So that would give C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Quinuclidine's point group is actually C3. Because it's a chiral molecule? Or is it? No, wait, quinuclidine is actually a meso compound. It has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. So its point group includes the mirror plane. If it has a C3 axis and a σh plane, then yes, it's C3h.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again about each molecule.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar with three isopropyl groups. So the molecule is symmetric under 120-degree rotations about the C3 axis (perpendicular to the plane). And it has a σh plane in the molecule's plane, which would reflect each group onto another. So yes, C3h.

Quinuclidine: has a three-fold axis (C3) and a σh plane. So yes, C3h as well.

Wait, so both options C and D could have C3h symmetry? But the question is which of the given molecules has it.

Wait, let me look back at the options. The options are labeled A, B, C, D, each corresponding to a molecule.

The options:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...-hexaone

B) benzo[...]trifuran...hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So both C and D could have C3h symmetry. But I'm not sure. Let me think about each.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Structure: B with three isopropyl groups, trigonal planar. So the molecule is flat with three identical substituents. So yes, it has a C3 axis. And it has a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the molecule itself). So C3h.

Option D is quinuclidine. It is a bridged bicyclic amine. The structure: it has a three-membered bridge, which would give a three-fold rotational axis. And it's a meso compound, so it has a plane of symmetry. So that plane would be the σh plane. So that gives C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I thought quinuclidine is a C3h molecule. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a different point group.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. Let me think about the possible structures.

Triisopropyl borate: as we said, C3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it's in the C3 point group. Wait, no. Because in C3h, the mirror plane is horizontal. If quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that's not horizontal, maybe it's a different point group.

Wait, what's the definition of a horizontal mirror plane? It's a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the Cn axis. So for C3h, the σh is perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, quinuclidine's symmetry: the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, and a plane of symmetry. But is that plane perpendicular to the rotation axis?

In quinuclidine, the three-fold axis is along the bridge, and the mirror plane is cutting through the bridge, so the plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So yes, that would make the σh plane, so the point group is C3h.

Similarly, triisopropyl borate has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, and the mirror plane is in the same plane as the substituents, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis (so it's a σh plane). So both have C3h symmetry.

But wait, the options are four, and only one can be correct. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, let me think about the structures again. Triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule with three substituents arranged 120 degrees apart. So any rotation of 120 degrees would leave the molecule looking the same, and the mirror plane would pass through the center, reflecting each substituent onto another. So that's a clear C3h.

What about quinuclidine? Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane system. The bridge is between two carbons. If you draw it, the molecule is symmetric across a plane that includes the bridge. That plane is also perpendicular to the three-fold rotation axis. So yes, that's the σh plane. So C3h symmetry.

Wait, that can't be right because the question gives only one correct option. So perhaps I'm incorrect about one of them.

Alternatively, maybe only one of them actually has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: triphenyleno[...]trifuran...hexaone (option A) — if it's a tricyclic system with three phenyl groups attached, perhaps arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees. That would give a C3 rotation and a mirror plane, making C3h.

Similarly, benzo[...]trifuran...hexaone (option B) — perhaps it's a benzofused furan system but not symmetric enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or option C.

Wait, let me think about the actual structures.

Triisopropyl borate: definitely has C3h symmetry because it's a trigonal planar arrangement with a mirror plane in the plane.

Quinuclidine: I'm a bit uncertain. I thought it has C3h, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, I'll look up the point groups of these molecules in my memory.

Triisopropyl borate: It's a trigonal planar molecule, so its point group is D3h, but wait, D3h includes C3 and σh, but also other operations. Wait, no, D3h is a higher symmetry. Because D3h has a three-fold rotation, three mirror planes, and inversion. Alternatively, if the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a single horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borate has no inversion symmetry. Because all the substituents are the same, so inversion would leave it unchanged. So, it's symmetric under inversion. Hmm, that complicates things. So perhaps its point group is D3h, but I'm not sure.

Wait, D3h has a horizontal mirror plane and a C3 axis, but also other elements like C2 and C2' axes, and other mirror planes. Triisopropyl borate probably doesn't have those. So perhaps it's just C3h.

Alternatively, maybe it's D3h. If so, then it might not have C3h symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about D3h. The D3h point group includes a C3 axis, a σh plane, and other operations. So triisopropyl borate might belong to D3h, but I thought the question was about C3h.

Similarly, quinuclidine: I think its point group is C3, not C3h. Because while it has a mirror plane, perhaps that mirror plane is not horizontal.

Wait, what defines a horizontal mirror plane? It's a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the Cn axis. So if the mirror plane in quinuclidine is not horizontal, then it can't have C3h.

Wait, what's the orientation of the mirror plane in quinuclidine? It's a meso compound, which has a plane of symmetry. If the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, then it's σh. Otherwise, it's a σv plane.

So if the mirror plane in quinuclidine is σh, then the point group is C3h. If it's a σv, then the point group is C3v, but that's a different scenario.

But I'm not certain about the exact orientation of the mirror plane in quinuclidine. Let me try to visualize it.

In quinuclidine, the bridge is between two carbons, and the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis through the bridge. The plane of symmetry would cut through the bridge and reflect the substituents on either side. So if the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, then it's σh.

So that would imply C3h symmetry. So both quinuclidine and triisopropyl borate have C3h symmetry? But that can't be because the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the question is which one has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think about the structure.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene has three benzene rings arranged in a sort of triangular fashion, connected by three bridges. When it's attached to a trifuran, perhaps the substituents are at 120-degree intervals. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation symmetry, and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, so perhaps that structure has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees, then yes.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the other options.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It definitely has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. So C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. I'm unsure, but I think it has C3h.

But the question is a multiple-choice, and I need to pick the correct option.

Wait, perhaps only option A has C3h symmetry. Let me think about the structure of each.

Wait, Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane. So, the molecule is symmetric in a way that it has a three-fold axis. But the mirror plane is not horizontal. Because the bridge is at a certain position, perhaps the mirror plane is tilted, making it a σv plane, not σh. So perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a σh plane, so it's just C3, not C3h.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry. So option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: the horizontal mirror plane is one that is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So if the mirror plane is in a direction that's perpendicular to the rotation axis, then it's σh.

In quinuclidine, the rotation axis is along the bridge. The mirror plane would be a plane that includes the bridge and cuts through the molecule. That plane would be perpendicular to the bridge (C3 axis), so it is a σh plane. Thus, the point group is C3h.

So both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have C3h symmetry.

But the options don't have two correct answers. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3v point group. Because if the mirror planes are vertical, then it would be C3v.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane in quinuclidine is not perpendicular to the C3 axis, making it C3 instead of C3h.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about another angle. The question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps only one of the options is correct.

Looking back, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

If I can eliminate some options:

Benzo[...]trifuran (option B) would have a benzene ring attached. The structure might not have three-fold symmetry because of the way the benzene is fused. So probably not C3h.

Triphenyleno[...], option A, perhaps has three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically, so C3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another thought: triphenyleno implies three phenyl groups connected in a symmetric way, as in triphenylene. Triphenylene has a three-fold axis. Then, if it's connected to a trifuran, the substituents would be symmetrically placed. So option A could have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: I'll think about each option's structure.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. The structure is trigonal planar, with three isopropyl groups arranged 120 degrees apart. So a clear C3 axis. A mirror plane in the same plane as the molecule, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis, so that's a σh plane. So yes, C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. The molecule has a three-membered bridge, and a plane of symmetry through the bridge. The mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, so σh. So yes, C3h.

So both options C and D have C3h symmetry. But the question gives four options, so only one can be correct.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about quinuclidine's point group. Perhaps quinuclidine is C2h or another point group.

Wait, let me think. Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine. It's a meso compound, so it has a plane of symmetry. The plane of symmetry is along the bridge, so it's a σ plane. The bridge is the three-membered bridge. The molecule's symmetry includes a C3 axis (rotating 120 degrees brings it back), and a σ plane. But is that σ plane horizontal?

Wait, the C3 axis is along the bridge. The mirror plane is through the bridge. So the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, making it a σh plane. So yes, C3h.

So if both options C and D have C3h symmetry, but in the question only one is correct, perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the presence of a horizontal mirror plane, but quinuclidine's symmetry doesn't include a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine is in a different point group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, the triphenyleno[...]trifuran.

Wait, another thought: the 'trifuran' part in option A has three oxygen atoms connected in a ring. If the substituents (phenyl groups) are attached at every 120 degrees around the trifuran, that would give a C3 axis. And if there's a mirror plane in the same plane as the ring, then yes, C3h.

So perhaps option A also has C3h.

But again, I'm getting stuck because I'm not certain which of these structures actually have C3h symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should look for the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. Triisopropyl borate definitely has it. Quinuclidine's mirror plane is through the bridge, which is a horizontal plane.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A. Or perhaps it's option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for which of these structures is known to have C3h symmetry.

I recall that triisopropyl borate is a common example of C3h symmetry. It's a trigonal planar molecule with a three-fold axis and a mirror plane in the plane.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I'm not certain. Wait, I think quinuclidine's point group is C3 because it only has a three-fold axis and no mirror plane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, quinuclidine is a meso compound, so it must have a mirror plane. So it must have C3h symmetry.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to find another angle. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. The options are four, and I need to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings arranged symmetrically, and when connected to a trifuran, the substituents are arranged every 120 degrees, making it have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, I think I've heard that triphenylene derivatives can have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a plane of symmetry (mirror plane) is necessary for C3h. So, which of these molecules definitely has a plane of symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: yes, because it's planar and symmetric.

Quinuclidine: yes, because it's a meso compound.

So both have C3h symmetry.

But the options only have four, so perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D, each is a different molecule. So perhaps the correct answer is option A or D.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. Let me think about the actual structures.

Triisopropyl borate: yes, it's a trigonal planar molecule, so it's C3h.

Quinuclidine: I'm not sure. Let me think about the actual molecule. Quinuclidine has a bridge, and the mirror plane is through the bridge. If the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis, then it's σh, making the point group C3h.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of mirror planes. C3h has one σh plane. D3h has multiple planes, including σh.

So, if a molecule only has one mirror plane (σh), its point group is C3h. If it has more, like three, then it's D3h.

So triisopropyl borate has only one mirror plane (the plane of the molecule), so it's C3h.

Quinuclidine: does it have more than one mirror plane? If it has a plane of symmetry through the bridge, but also other planes, then it would be D3h. But I think quinuclidine only has that one mirror plane, so it's C3h.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has multiple mirror planes.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to reach a conclusion.

I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait! I just thought that the molecule has three substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. So it's in the trigonal planar geometry, which is D3h. No, wait, trigonal planar is D3h because it has a horizontal mirror plane, a C3 axis, and other symmetry elements.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The trigonal planar molecule, like BF3, has D3h symmetry because it has a C3 axis, a σh plane, and other planes. But triisopropyl borate is a neutral molecule, but its structure is trigonal planar with three identical groups. So perhaps it's D3h.

Wait, but D3h includes a C3 axis, σh, and C2 axes perpendicular to the C3. But triisopropyl borate doesn't have any C2 axes. So perhaps it's only C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is C3h.

But I'm getting stuck in the details. I think I'll have to go with my initial analysis that triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on the defining characteristics of **C₃h** symmetry: a three-fold rotation axis (**C₃**) and a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**) that is perpendicular to the **C₃** axis.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule contains a triphenylene core, which is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings arranged symmetrically. The trifuran ring is fused to the triphenylene, and the substituents are likely arranged at 120° intervals. This arrangement suggests a **C₃** axis. If there is a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the **C₃** axis, the molecule would have **C₃h** symmetry. However, the exact structure is unclear, and there is no definitive evidence provided to confirm the presence of a **σh** plane.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a benzene ring fused with a trifuran system. The arrangement of the substituents does not appear to be symmetric at 120° intervals, as the fused benzene ring disrupts the three-fold symmetry. Without a clear **C₃** axis or a horizontal mirror plane, this molecule does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around a central boron atom. This arrangement provides a clear **C₃** axis (perpendicular to the plane of the molecule). Additionally, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**), which is perpendicular to the **C₃** axis. Therefore, triisopropyl borate has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a three-membered bridge. It has a **C₃** axis along the bridge and is a meso compound, meaning it has a plane of symmetry. However, the exact orientation of the mirror plane is critical. If the plane of symmetry is perpendicular to the **C₃** axis, it would qualify as a **σh** plane, giving the molecule **C₃h** symmetry. If the mirror plane is not horizontal, the symmetry would be different. While there is uncertainty about the exact orientation of the mirror plane, quinuclidine is tentatively considered to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Both **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) and **quinuclidine** (Option D) appear to have **C₃h** symmetry based on the analysis. However, since the question specifies only one correct answer, **triisopropyl borate** is the most definitive choice due to its clear trigonal planar geometry and the unambiguous presence of both a **C₃** axis and a **σh** plane.

**Answer: C**
