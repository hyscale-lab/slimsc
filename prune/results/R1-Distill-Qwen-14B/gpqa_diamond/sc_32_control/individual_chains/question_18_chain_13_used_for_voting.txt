Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about elemental abundances in stars. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. Alright, the question gives me some data about two stars and their elemental abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. 

Let me read the problem again carefully. There are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. The problem gives me some abundance ratios: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex. Oh, and there's also the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) is 7. I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres.

Wait, okay, the ratio of silicon atoms. So, I think that means n_Si,1 divided by n_Si,2. Or maybe the other way around? Let me make sure. The question says the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2's photospheres.

First, I should probably figure out the abundances for each element in each star. The problem uses the notation [X/Y] which I think represents the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of X to Y abundances compared to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, is it [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun? Or is it log(n_X/n_Y) minus the solar value? Let me recall. Oh yes, the definition is [X/Y] = log_10(n_X/n_Y) - log_10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

So, given that, let me jot down the given data.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

And the Sun's data:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, wait, no—wait, that 12 is part of the formula. So the Sun's data is given as 12 + log(...)= value. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 =-4.5 → nFe/nH =10^-4.5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, nFe/nH_sun =1e-4.5, which is the same as 3.16e-5? Because 10^(-4.5) is sqrt(10^(-9)) )= sqrt(1e-9)≈3.16e-5.

Similarly, Mg in sun is 1e-5, which is 1e-5.

Now, for each star, I can compute the ratios.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun → nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun. So, nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → So the ratio of Fe to H is the same as the sun.

Similarly, Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 = log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, wait, the [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

Hmm. So let me compute nSi_1 / nFe_1. From Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, because [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun → which means log(nSi/nFe)_1 = [log(nSi/nFe)_sun] + 0.3 → so nSi/nFe = 10^{ [log( nSi/nFe)_sun] + 0.3 } = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Wait, but nSi_sun / nFe_sun is known? Because in the Sun, nFe/nH is known, and nMg/nH is known, but what about nSi/nH?

Wait, maybe we don't need nSi in the Sun directly. Hmm. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratios in terms of H, because the problem gives us nFe/nH and nMg/nH for the Sun.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the solar [Si/Fe] or [Si/H], but we can calculate it.

Wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH is 1e-4.5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5. But what about nSi/nH? I'm not given that. Hmm, maybe I can find [Si/Fe] in the Sun first.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun ? No wait, no. [X/Y]_sun is zero because you compare the Sun to itself. So [Si/Fe]_sun is zero.

Wait, but wait, for [X/Y], it's (X/Y)/(X/Y)_sun -1 in log space. No, no. [X/Y] is log10( (n_X/n_Y) ) - log10( (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero because you're comparing the same thing.

So, in the Sun, nSi/nFe is (nSi/nH)/(nFe/nH) ) = (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH) ). But I don't have nSi/nH for the Sun. Hmm, that complicates things a bit. Maybe I can express everything in terms of other elements.

Wait, the problem gives us for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Ah, so perhaps I can find the ratios for Mg, Si, Fe, and H in each star.

Let me approach each star separately.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → which means the abundance ratio of Fe to H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which means that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times higher than in the Sun. So nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I don't know nSi_sun / nFe_sun. Let me compute that.

Wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH is 1e-4.5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5. I don't have nSi/nH, but perhaps I can express nSi in terms of nMg or something else. Hmm, perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, so perhaps the solar ratios for Si will cancel out. Let me proceed.

So, for Star_1, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH_1 / nH_sun), because nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 is nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun ), so:

nSi_1 = [nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun ) ] * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3 → 

Simplify: nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * nFe_sun * 10^0.3.

Wait, nFe_sun cancels, so:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

Hmm. But I don't have nSi_sun. Hmm, perhaps I can find nSi_sun from the other data.

Wait, let me think. The problem doesn't give the solar Si abundance, but maybe we can find it from the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si to H in each star and then compute the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of H. Let's see.

For Star_1, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

And nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3 → substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = [nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun)] * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3

So, nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

So, [nSi_1 / nH_1 ] = [ (nH_1 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3 ) ] / nH_1 

Simplify: [nSi_1 / nH_1 ] = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

So, [nSi_1 / nH_1 ] = [nSi_sun / nH_sun ] * 10^0.3 → which is the same as [Si/H]_1 = 0 + 0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = 0.3. Because [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [Si/Fe] is 0.3, and [Fe/H] is 0, so [Si/H] is 0.3. Oh, right! Because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H]. So since [Fe/H] is 0, [Si/Fe] equals [Si/H]. So that's easier. So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So, for Star_1, [Si/H] = 0.3. Which means that the ratio nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, let's see:

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) =0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 = log(nMg/nH) - log(nMg_sun / nH_sun) =0 → so nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) +0.3.

So, nMg_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^0.3.

But also, from [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

Substituting into the previous equation:

nMg_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun) → so,

(nH_2 *nMg_sun /nH_sun ) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Rearranging for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = [nH_2 *nMg_sun /nH_sun ] / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^0.3 ]

Simplify:

nSi_2 = [nH_2 /nH_sun ] * [nMg_sun /nMg_sun ] * [nSi_sun / (1e0.3) ]

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun / 1e0.3.

So, [nSi_2 /nH_2 ] = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * (1 /1e0.3) ) → [nSi_2 /nH_2 ] = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 1e-0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) → which is log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun)*1e-0.3 ) - log( nSi_sun /nH_sun ) → which is log(1e-0.3 ) → which is -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [Mg/Si] is 0.3. Since [Mg/H] is zero, [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So now, for each star, I have [Si/H].

- Star_1: [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

- Star_2: [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 = 10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

We need the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) → which is [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) ] / [ (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ].

Substituting the values:

= [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ]

The (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) terms cancel out.

So, 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} =10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98 → approximately 4.

Wait, so the ratio is about 3.98, which is roughly 4. So the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is about 4, so the answer would be option A) ~3.9.

Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any errors.

1. For Star_1: [Fe/H] =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = same as Sun.

2. [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

3. For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = same as Sun.

4. [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

5. So, nSi_2/nH_2 =10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )

6. Ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ] / [10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ] =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is approximately 3.9, which is option A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we find \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \). Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we get \( n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \).
- Thus, \( [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3 \), meaning \( n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \).

### Star_2:
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means the ratio of Mg to H in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we find \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \). Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we get \( n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \).
- Thus, \( [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3 \), meaning \( n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}})}{10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}})} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio is approximately 3.9.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
