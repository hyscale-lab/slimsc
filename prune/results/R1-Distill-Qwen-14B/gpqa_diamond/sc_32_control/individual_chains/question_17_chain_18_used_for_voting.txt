Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a given concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, forming complexes with metal ions. So, the problem involves some kind of dissociation of the complex into calcium ions and EDTA.

The given data is: the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the K here is the formation constant, right? The formation constant for the complex Ca-EDTA. I think the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Or wait, maybe it's written differently. Oh, right, Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So, Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]).

But in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. But then, it's in solution, and it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-. So the question is, what's the concentration of Ca²+ ions?

Assuming that the complex is in equilibrium with the calcium and EDTA ions. So the concentration of Ca²+ will be very low because Kf is very large, indicating a stable complex. So the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the Ca²+ concentration is small.

But how do I calculate it? Let's think about the equilibrium. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA⁴-, the concentration of EDTA⁴- will also be x. But wait, wait. Wait, the solution initially has the complex, so the initial concentrations before dissociation would have [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] ≈ 0, [EDTA⁴-] ≈ 0.

So the complex dissociates as follows: CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴-. Let the change be +x for both [Ca²+] and [EDTA⁴-]. So at equilibrium, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small compared to 0.02). So, Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] ) ≈ 0.02/(x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²).

Wait, but Kf is given as 5e10. So set up the equation:

5e10 ≈ (0.02)/(x²)

Wait, let me write this out:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]) 
=> 5e10 ≈ (0.02)/(x²)

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2e-3)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, wait, let's compute that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/(5)) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

Wait, no. Let me compute:

0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10)
= (2/(5)) * 1e-12
= 0.4e-12
= 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 squared? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 (since 6.5 *2 is 13). So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this.

Wait, but let me double-check. So Kf is 5e10. So the equation is 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2). So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 0.000001, 1e-7 is 0.0000001. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is ~6.3e-7. That's exactly option C.

So the answer should be C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the dissociation produces equal amounts of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), their concentrations are both \(x\). The equilibrium expression for \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\) is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(x^2\):
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
