Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z squared equals the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. So first, I need to find these two expectation values.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, so the state is expressed in the P_z basis. That means when I write the state as a vector, each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z.

First, I think I need to find the expectation value of P_z, which is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Then the expectation of P_z squared, ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Subtracting the square of the first from the second gives me (ΔP_z)^2, and then I take the square root to find ΔP_z.

So let's start with the expectation value of P_z, which is the average value. The matrix for P_z is given as:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0],
Row 2: [0, 0, 0],
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ].

Wait, actually, looking at the P_z matrix again: the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So when I calculate ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, it's the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z.

So let's compute each term:

First component: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) → Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is the sum of the components of ψ multiplied by the diagonal elements of P_z and then by the components again? Wait, no. Let me think. The expectation value is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, it's just the sum of each component squared multiplied by the diagonal elements.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector with elements (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2). So ψ† P_z is a row vector where each element is the product of ψ† and the corresponding column of P_z. But since P_z is diagonal, each element is just the product of the respective component of ψ and the diagonal element.

So the product ψ† P_z gives [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ] → [ (-ħ/2), 0, (ħ/2) ].

Then, when you multiply this by ψ, which is a column vector, you get the sum of each element multiplied by the corresponding component of ψ.

So:

(-ħ/2) * (-1/2) + 0 * (1/√2) + (ħ/2) * (-1/2)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-ħ/2) * (-1/2) = (ħ/4)

Third term: (ħ/2) * (-1/2) = (-ħ/4)

So sum is (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0.

Hmm, so the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. That's interesting.

Now, the expectation value of P_z squared, ⟨P_z²⟩. Well, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared, because P_z is diagonal. So the matrix P_z² has diagonal entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2.

So the matrix P_z² is:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]

[ 0, 0, 0 ]

[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

Wait, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ², yeah.

So to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, it's ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, since P_z² is diagonal, ψ† P_z² is [ (-1/2)ħ², 0, (-1/2)ħ² ].

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because each component of ψ is multiplied by the diagonal element of P_z².

So the first component of ψ is -1/2. Multiply by (ħ²) → (-1/2) * ħ².

Third component is (-1/2) → multiply by ħ² → (-1/2) * ħ².

Wait, no. Because P_z² is diagonal, so when you do ψ† P_z², each element is ψ_i^* multiplied by the diagonal element (since it's diagonal, else you'd have to sum over j for each i). So ψ is a real vector, so ψ† is the same as the transpose here.

So ψ† P_z² is [ (-1/2)* (ħ²), (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)* (ħ²) ] → [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Wait no! Wait, no. Because P_z² is diagonal, the multiplication is element-wise.

So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Multiply each element by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z²:

First element: (-1/2) * ħ²

Second element: (1/√2) * 0 → 0.

Third element: (-1/2) * ħ².

So ψ† P_z² is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Then, multiply this by ψ, which is the column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So the expectation value is:

( -ħ²/2 )*(-1/2) ) + (0)*(1/√2) + ( -ħ²/2 )*(-1/2 )

Compute each term:

First term: ( ħ²/4 )

Third term: ( ħ²/4 )

So the sum is ( ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 ) = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Earlier, we found that ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. So ΔP_z squared is ⟨P_z²⟩ minus (⟨P_z⟩)^2 → which is (ħ²/2) - (0) → ħ²/2.

So ΔP_z is the square root of (ħ²/2 ) → (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait the state is given as a column vector: ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ). So ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

When calculating ⟨P_z⟩, which is sum of ψ_i * (P_z diagonal term) * ψ_i.

So each term is ψ_i^2 * (P_z diagonal term for that i).

So for i=1: ( -1/2 )^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ → ħ/4.

i=2: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 → 0.

i=3: (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) → (1/4)(-ħ) → -ħ/4.

Sum: (ħ/4 ) + 0 + (-ħ/4 ) → 0. Correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is ψ_i^2 multiplied by (P_z squared diagonal term).

i=1: (1/4) * ħ² → ħ²/4.

i=2: (1/2) * 0 → 0.

i=3: (1/4) * ħ² → ħ²/4.

Sum: ħ²/4 +0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ΔP_z squared is ( ħ²/2 ) - (0)^2 = ħ²/2.

So ΔP_z is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) → ħ / sqrt(2).

So the correct answer should be option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with elements $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i P_z^{(i)} \psi_i,
\]

where $P_z^{(i)}$ is the $i$-th diagonal element of $P_z$. Substituting the values:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1^2 \cdot \hbar = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{4}$,
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2^2 \cdot 0 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$,
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Summing these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with elements $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i^2 \cdot (P_z^2)^{(i)}.
\]

Substituting the values:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$,
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2^2 \cdot 0 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$,
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Summing these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
