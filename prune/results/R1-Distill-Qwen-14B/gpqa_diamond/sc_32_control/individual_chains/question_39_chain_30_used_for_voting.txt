Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So, I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Wait, the wave function is a complex function because of the 'i' term. Right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, and the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So, to find the normalization constant 'a', I think I need to compute the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space, and set it equal to 1 because the total probability must be 1.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the complex conjugate would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. The absolute square is ψ*ψ, so that's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a...)(a...), the cross terms (the ones with i and -i) will cancel out, leaving the sum of squares.

Oh, right! So the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [a² / (1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the wave function is given only in a region where x is between 1 and 3. Oh, because the particles were only found there. So the wave function is zero outside that region, but according to the problem statement, the wave function is as given only in that part. So the normalization integral should be over x from 1 to 3.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So the integral becomes ∫(from 1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me separate that into two integrals: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), evaluated from 1 to3. So that's [ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

The second integral is from x=1 to x=3, so that's 2 units. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Let me calculate that square root. Hmm, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 1 dx = 3 - 1 = 2
   \]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
