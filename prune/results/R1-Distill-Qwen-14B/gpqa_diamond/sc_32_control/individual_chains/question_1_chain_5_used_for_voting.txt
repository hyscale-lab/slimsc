Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D, with various exponents of 10 and eV units.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with the lifetimes of energy states. Oh right! The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Wait, but in this problem, the lifetimes given are the mean lifetimes of the states, right? So the uncertainty in time Δt would be related to the lifetime τ. I think for exponential decay, the standard deviation is about τ, but sometimes people take Δt as τ or maybe half of it? Not sure, but maybe for this problem, they approximate Δt as the lifetime τ.

So the lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s. But wait, wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Oh wait, no. The problem says we have two states, each with their own lifetimes. We want to distinguish them, so their energy difference should be such that their spectral lines (or whatever they are) don't overlap. How does the lifetime relate to the energy uncertainty?

Right, the lifetime of a state is inversely proportional to the energy uncertainty of that state. Because from ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ). So for a longer lifetime (bigger τ), the energy uncertainty is smaller. So if τ is bigger, the energy is more precisely known.

But in this problem, the two states have different lifetimes. So the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. But wait, how do these uncertainties affect the distinguishability of the two energy levels?

Wait, maybe the idea is that the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties to ensure they can be resolved. Because if the energy difference is too small, their uncertainty intervals might overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

So the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to clearly distinguish them.

Let me calculate:

ΔE1 = ħ / (1e-9 s)
ΔE2 = ħ / (1e-8 s)

But let me compute the values.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert this into eV. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So let's compute ħ in eV·s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

Convert J to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So ħ ≈ 1.05e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s ≈ 6.54e-16 eV·s.

Wait, let me compute that again:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV
So ħ in eV·s is:

1.0545718e-34 J·s * (6.242e18 eV/J) = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 = Let me compute that.

1e-34 * 6e18 is 6e-16. More accurately: 1.0545718 *6.242 ≈ 6.582. So 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check those numbers.

Wait τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, so for ΔE1: 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

ΔE2 is 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are approximately 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV, respectively.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9:

(6.582e-16)/(1e-9) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Yes, that's correct.

So the two energy levels have uncertainties in their energies: E1 has an uncertainty of about 6.58e-7 eV, and E2 has about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Wait no, wait. The two states have energies E1 and E2, each with their own lifetimes, hence their own uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy difference as being the difference between E1 and E2, and the total uncertainty would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Because if E1 is uncertain by ΔE1 and E2 by ΔE2, then the difference would be uncertain by ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So in order for E1 and E2 to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Let me compute ΔE1 + ΔE2: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, wait 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait 7.24e-7 eV is 0.000000724 eV.

So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is larger than 0.000000724.

Wait, but wait: 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV= 1e-4 eV.

So 1e-4 eV is larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than the required 7.24e-7 eV.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.24e-7 eV. So that's too small.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the exponents. Let me compute the numbers again.

Wait, let me think again.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV.

ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.238e-7 eV for the two states to be distinguished.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV.

Which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 is much larger than 7.24e-7.

So yes, option C would satisfy ΔE > sum of uncertainties.

Wait but wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.00000000001 eV.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV.

So the required minimum energy difference is about 7.24e-7 eV, which is 0.000000724 eV.

Option C is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than that. So that would work.

But wait, wait a minute. Do I have that right? Because if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, then yes, the peaks would be separated enough to resolve.

So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, let me think about whether the energy difference is actually the difference between E1 and E2, or if there's something else.

Wait, no, the energy difference is |E2 - E1|. We want that to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties to ensure they don't overlap.

So yes, the correct answer is option C.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). The energy uncertainty for each state is related to its lifetime \( \tau \) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For the given lifetimes:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To ensure the two energy levels are distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluate the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the correct energy difference that allows the two states to be clearly distinguished is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
