Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and from that, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember they're related to point groups in molecular geometry. So I need to figure out what molecule E is, and then determine its symmetry.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H.

I think I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's start by looking for familiar reactions and products.

The bright red product C makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide (SO3), but wait, what else is bright red? Oh! I remember that when metals react with certain gases, they can form colored compounds. Wait, another possibility is that C is sulfur trioxide, but when I think about solid A reacting with gas B to form SO3, what could A and B be?

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur (S), and B is oxygen (O2). Sulfur burning in O2 forms SO3. But wait, the amount of O2 is 8 equivalents. Let me think about stoichiometry.

S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g). But in that case, 1 mole of S reacts with 1 mole of O2 to form 1 mole of SO2. But in our case, the reaction produces C, which requires 8 equivalents of B. So 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B. Hmm, that suggests a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that B is O2, and the reaction produces SO3. Let me calculate the stoichiometry. Sulfur (S) reacts with oxygen to form SO3. The reaction is: S(s) + (3/2) O2(g) → SO3(g). But wait, that would require 3/2 moles of O2 per mole of S. But the problem states 8 equivalents. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe A is lead(IV) oxide, PbO2. No, perhaps another approach. Let me think about C reacting with water to form A, F, and G. If C is SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (a strong acid) and... Wait, but then what would the other product be? Oh, maybe if C is a sulfite, but no, sulfites aren't typically bright red. Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with water producing two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). So, C is probably something that can hydrolyze into two acids. Hmm, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, but then when it reacts with water, it would produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and perhaps another acid if it's a salt. Or perhaps C is a nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about D reacting with B to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But B is a gas. If B is O2, and D is H2, then H would be H2O, a solvent. But D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio. H2 and O2 react in a 1:1 ratio to make H2O, but the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So that wouldn't be 1:1. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought. If B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O, but the stoichiometry would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio of D to B would be 2:1. But the question says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, but that's a liquid. Hmm. Maybe B is Cl2 and D is another gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, back to the first reaction. Suppose A is Na, a solid. B is Cl2 gas. 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 8 moles. So sodium (Na) reacting with Cl2 to form NaCl. But sodium chloride is white, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, A is Fe, and B is Cl2. 8 equivalents would mean Fe + 4Cl2 → 2FeCl3? But FeCl3 is yellowish, not bright red.

Wait, another possibility. What if A is Cu and B is Cl2? The reaction would be Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2, which is green. Not bright red.

Wait, perhaps C is something else. If C is a metal oxide that is bright red, like iron(III) oxide is reddish, but not bright red. Wait, maybe it's a sulfide? Or perhaps it's a nitride? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3. Let me think again. If A is S (solid), and B is O2, then the reaction could be S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. But wait, that would be 3 equivalents of B per 1 A. But the problem states 8 equivalents. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe A is PbS, and B is O2. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a different kind of synthesis. Let me think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, what's a hazardous product? Maybe something like phosgene or another toxic gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound, like a peroxide or something else.

Wait, another angle. The product C when reacted with water gives two acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). If F is a strong acid, perhaps H2SO4, and G is a weak acid, like H2SO3. Wait, but how would that happen? If C is SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4, but that's just one acid. Unless C is a mixture or another compound.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, but that's not likely because sulfites are not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, but nitrates are usually colorless or white.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two different acids, so maybe C is a nitrate and a nitrite salt, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: if C is a nitrate, say, Ca(NO3)2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but again, not sure.

Wait, maybe F and G are sulfuric and sulfurous acids. So, if C is a sulfite, then when it reacts with water, it produces H2SO3 and another acid. But then, where does the other acid come from?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride or something that can hydrolyze into two acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to find possible compounds E and see their symmetry.

Looking at the options:

Option C is D∞h. That's the symmetry of a linear molecule with multiple atoms, like CO2 is D∞h? Wait, CO2 is linear, with D∞h symmetry. But another molecule with D∞h is SO2? No, SO2 is bent, so its symmetry is D2h or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, D∞h is the symmetry group for a linear molecule with an infinite number of planes of symmetry. So, for example, I2 (diiodine) is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, I2 is a diatomic molecule with linear symmetry, so it's D∞h.

Alternatively, O2 and O3 have different symmetries. O2 is diatomic, so D∞h.

So, if E is O2 or O3, which are diatomic or triatomic, but E is a product of C and D.

Wait, going back to the reactions. Let's think about the possible products.

C is a bright red product. Let's think about lead dioxide (PbO2), which is a bright red solid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another compound that is bright red is mercury(II) oxide, HgO, but I think that's red, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another chromium compound is red. Alternatively, it could be vanadium compounds, but I'm not certain.

Let me try to think of the possible structures. If E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry, that would correspond to option C) D∞h.

But how would E be O2? Let's see the reactions.

Wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. If C is SO3 and D is H2O, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, earlier reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So if C is SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (acid F) and perhaps something else. Wait, no, H2O plus SO3 gives H2SO4, which is a strong acid. So then where does G come from?

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. Then, when it reacts with water, perhaps it dissolves into Ca^2+ and nitrate ions. But that wouldn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 and Mg(OH)2. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each reaction step again.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red).

Second: C + 2 D (gas) → E (hazardous).

Third: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Fourth: D + B → H (solvent).

Let me think about D and B. D and B are gases reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Solvents are often polar, like water, alcohols, etc.

Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2, then D and B would react to form H2O.

But the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the molar ratio is 2:1. But the problem says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then the reaction would be H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Unless H is HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. Then they could react to form H2CO3, which is a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 (a gas) and D is H2O (liquid, but the problem states D is a gas). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: B is O2, D is H2O. Then the reaction would be O2 + H2O → maybe something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is NH3. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl and B is O2. Then their reaction would be 2 HCl + O2 → 2 H2O + Cl2. But not sure if that produces a solvent.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about another angle. The product E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe phosgene (COCl2), sarin gas, or other nerve agents. But perhaps in this context, it's a simpler molecule.

Wait, if E is O2, then it's a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then option C (D∞h) would be the answer.

But how does E come about? From C reacting with 2 D.

Wait, if C is SO3 and D is H2O, then perhaps C + 2 H2O → H2SO4 (F) and H2S (G), but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, let me write the equations:

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red)

Second: C + 2 D → E

Third: C + H2O → A + H2SO4 (F) + H2S (G)

Wait, but H2S is a weak acid, so that fits. So if F is H2SO4 (strong acid) and G is H2S (weak acid), then that would make sense.

So, C could be SO3. Then, from the third reaction: SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 + H2S? Wait, that doesn't seem right stoichiometrically. Wait, SO3 plus H2O gives H2SO4, but how do you get H2S?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about C being SO3.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into H2SO3 and NaOH. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2. Then, when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But that doesn't produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back: the third reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So it's a hydrolysis reaction. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is an acid anhydride.

For example, if C is SOCl2 (thionyl chloride), then reacting with water would produce HCl (strong acid) and SO2 (which is a gas, but not an acid). Hmm, not exactly matching.

Alternatively, if C is a mixed anhydride, like HSO3Cl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, C could be an acid chloride, like HClO4. But then, reacting with water would just produce HClO4 and HClO4 again, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate ester, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the possible structures of E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D.

If E is O2, then that's a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. But how would E be O2?

Alternatively, if E is O3, which is a triatomic molecule with C2v symmetry (since O3 is bent, like ozone). Ozone has a bent structure with a central oxygen atom, so its symmetry group is C2v.

Wait, the options include C2v (option D) and D∞h (option C). So, if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But how would E be O3?

Wait, let me think about the reactions again. If C is SO3, and D is H2O, then C + 2 H2O → H2SO4 (F) and H2S (G). But then E would be formed by C + 2 D → E.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O, and C is SO3. Then, C + 2 H2O → H2SO4 and maybe another product. But earlier that didn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O, and E is H2O2. H2O2 is a weak oxidizing agent, but not extremely hazardous. Or maybe E is O2. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the reaction D + B → H, which is a solvent. If B is O2 and D is H2O, then H could be H2O (but that's the same as D). Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O, but H would be H2O, which is a solvent. So, D is H2O and B is O2.

Wait, but D is a gas, so H2O is a liquid under standard conditions. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas that reacts with O2 to form H as a solvent. For example, D could be NH3. Then, O2 and NH3 could react to form HNO3 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: B is O2, D is CO. They react to form CO2 and maybe other products. But I'm not certain.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think about the possible structures of E.

If E is O2, symmetry group D∞h (option C). If E is O3, then C2v (option D). What other possibilities are there?

Wait, another extremely hazardous product is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a trigonal planar structure and D3h symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is diatomic, symmetry group D∞h. But Cl2 is yellowish-green, not bright red.

Wait, perhaps E is SO2, which is a gas, but its structure is bent, so its symmetry group is D2h. Hmm, not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: E is NO, which is a linear molecule with symmetry group D∞h. But NO is a colorless gas, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. If C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2, then when it reacts with 2 moles of D (which might be H2O?), perhaps it produces some nitric acid and another product.

Wait, perhaps C is Ca(NO3)2. Then, when it reacts with H2O, it could hydrolyze into Ca(OH)2 and HNO3. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfate, like CuSO4, then reacting with water would give CuSO4·5H2O, but that's a blue solution, not sure about the acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something else, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, maybe I should try to figure out what H is. H is formed when D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, and it's a solvent. So possible solvents are H2O, ethanol, etc. But since B and D are gases, their reaction must form a liquid or another gas. If H is a solvent, it's likely a liquid, so perhaps H is H2O. But then B and D would need to react to form H2O.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O. Then, Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio. HCl is a strong acid, but HOCl is a weak acid. Wait, but how would that help? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CO. Then, O2 + 2 CO → 2 CO2. No, the ratio is 1:2, not 1:1.

Alternatively, B is O2 and D is CO2. Then maybe reacting to form something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to focus on the possible symmetry groups of E and see which one is more likely.

Let me list the options again:

A) C2: This is a twofold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O (but H2O isn't linear) or some bent molecules have this symmetry.

B) D4h: This is a higher symmetry group, including a fourfold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors. Molecules like methane don't fit, but perhaps something like octahedral structures, but I'm not certain.

C) D∞h: This is for linear molecules with an infinite number of planes of symmetry, like O2, H2, I2.

D) C2v: This is for bent molecules with a twofold rotation axis and two vertical mirrors. Ozone (O3) has this symmetry.

So, the possible E molecules could be O2 (D∞h), O3 (C2v), H2O (but H2O is not linear, so C2v maybe?), or another linear molecule.

Wait, if E is O3, then the symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is O2, it's D∞h (option C).

Which of these makes more sense in the reactions?

If E is O3, then C + 2 D → O3. But how? Let's think.

Wait, let's say B is O2 and D is H2O. Then, D + B would be H2O + O2 → H2O2? But H2O2 is H-O-O-H, which is a diatomic structure with a peroxide bond. H2O2 is a liquid, so perhaps H is H2O2.

Wait, D + B → H, which is H2O2. So D could be H2O and B is O2. Then, the reaction would be 2 H2O + O2 → 2 H2O2. The ratio is 2:1, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is O2. The reaction is H2O + O2 → O3? But that's not a typical reaction. Ozone is formed by the photolysis of O2, not by reacting with H2O.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2O, perhaps the reaction is something else. But I'm not finding a fit.

Wait, another angle: if E is O2, then the reaction C + 2 D → O2. So D must be a diatomic gas that, when reacted with C, produces O2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O2. But H2O2 has C2v symmetry (like ozone). So if E is H2O2, then the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But how would E be formed? C + 2 D → H2O2.

Hmm. Let me think about the first reaction. A + 8 B → C. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of A.

If A is carbon (solid), and B is O2, then the reaction would be C + 8 O2 → C something. Wait, carbon reacting with excess O2 would form CO2, but that's only one O2 per C. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S), and 8 equivalents of O2. Reaction: S + 8 O2 → something. But S + O2 usually forms SO2 or SO3, but 8 O2 would be too much. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, like lead (Pb), and B is O2. Pb + O2 → PbO2, which is bright red. Oh, that's possible!

So, solid lead (Pb) reacts with O2 (gas) to form PbO2, which is bright red. The reaction would be:

Pb(s) + O2(g) → PbO2(s)

But what's the stoichiometry? Lead(IV) oxide is formed when lead is burned in excess oxygen. The reaction is:

2 Pb + 3 O2 → 2 PbO2.

So that would be 3 equivalents of O2 per 2 moles of Pb. But the problem says 8 equivalents. Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the reaction is Pb + 8 O2 → PbO2. That would imply 8 moles of O2 per mole of Pb. But the correct reaction is 2 Pb + 3 O2 → 2 PbO2. So 3 O2 per 2 Pb. Does that fit 8 equivalents? Maybe not directly. Perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe (iron), and B is Cl2. 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean Fe + 4 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. Iron(III) chloride is yellowish, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps A is Cu and B is Cl2. 8 equivalents would mean Cu + 4 Cl2 → 2 CuCl2. But CuCl2 is blue, not red.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on this. Let me try another approach.

If the product E is O2, then its symmetry is D∞h (option C). If E is O3, symmetry is C2v (option D).

Which one is more likely as an extremely hazardous product? Ozone is toxic, but O2 is a common gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which is yellow-green and very hazardous, but Cl2 is diatomic with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but how would Cl2 fit into the reactions?

Let me try that. Suppose E is Cl2.

Then, the second reaction is: C + 2 D → Cl2.

If E is Cl2, then D must be a gas that when reacts with C, releases Cl2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is HCl gas. Then, C reacting with HCl could produce Cl2. But how?

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, earlier reactions: C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). If C is a metal oxide, say, lead oxide, then reacting with water might not produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try to think about the possible E structures and match with the options.

Between options C (D∞h) and D (C2v), and others.

If E is O2, symmetry is D∞h.

If E is O3, symmetry is C2v.

Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is linear, symmetry D∞h. Wait, CO2 is linear, so D∞h symmetry. So CO2 would have D∞h.

Wait, but in the second reaction, C + 2 D → E. If E is CO2, then D would be something that reacts with C to form CO2.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O, but H2O is not linear. Its symmetry is C2v if it were linear, but it's bent, so symmetry is C2v? Wait, no. The molecule H2O is bent, with a bond angle of about 104.5 degrees. Its point group is C2v.

Wait, but in that case, E would be H2O. But H2O isn't extremely hazardous. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl, which is linear (D∞h). But HCl isn't extremely hazardous in small quantities, but perhaps in large amounts.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. But its point group is D2h, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps E is NO, a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. NO is a toxic gas.

But how?

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions. If C is a nitride, like NaNO3. Then, C + 2 D → E. If D is something that would liberate NO, maybe H2O? No, NaNO3 + H2O wouldn't produce NO.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrite salt, but I'm not sure.

This is really tough. Let me try to imagine that E has D∞h symmetry, which would be option C.

If E is O2, then D∞h is correct. So the answer would be C.

But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, if E is O3, then symmetry is C2v.

But in the options, one is C2v (D) and the other is D∞h (C).

How else can I find out?

Wait, looking at the fourth reaction: D + B → H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B must react to form H2O.

If B is O2 and D is H2O, then H would be H2O. But the reaction would be H2O plus O2 → H2O. Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, D is H2O and B is O2. The reaction could be 2 H2O + O2 → 2 H2O2 (but that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1).

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is O2. Then, 4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O. But that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is not H2O. Let me think. Solvents include ethanol, methanol, etc., but they are liquids, not gases. So D and B must react to form a liquid. But D and B are gases, so their reaction must form a liquid. For example, NH3 (gas) and HCl (gas) → NH4Cl (solid), which isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O (as a gas, steam) and B is another gas.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. They can react to form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), which is a weak acid but not a solvent in the usual sense.

Alternatively, B is SO3 and D is H2O. They react to form H2SO4, but that's an acid, not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is something else. But I'm not getting anywhere.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the information.

Given that E is extremely hazardous and produced from C and D, and considering that O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, I'll go with option C) D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the formation of product E, and the goal is to determine its molecular symmetry group. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like PbO₂ (lead(IV) oxide). However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear due to the stoichiometric mismatch in common reactions like sulfur combustion.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a toxic gas. Possible candidates include O₂, O₃, or other hazardous gases like phosgene (COCl₂). However, phosgene's symmetry group (D₂h) is not among the options, narrowing the focus to O₂ or O₃.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This implies C is likely an acid anhydride or a compound capable of hydrolysis. For example, if C were SO₃, it could hydrolyze to H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and H₂S (weak acid). However, this does not align perfectly with the reactions described.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Possible solvents include H₂O, but the reaction between D and B forming H is unclear. For instance, if B is O₂ and D is H₂O, the reaction could form H₂O₂, a solvent, but the stoichiometry does not match a 1:1 ratio.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - If E is O₂, it is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, a high-symmetry group for linear molecules.
   - If E is O₃, it is a bent molecule with C₂v symmetry, which is consistent with its structure.
   - Other candidates like H₂O or H₂O₂ were considered but did not align with the "extremely hazardous" description or the symmetry options provided.

Given the options and the analysis, the most plausible symmetry group for E is D∞h, consistent with O₂, a diatomic and extremely hazardous gas.

**Answer: C**
