Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. 

Alright, let me read the problem again. Two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, the masses might not directly affect the abundance ratios, but maybe the problem is more about the given [X/Y] values.

The given abundances are: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. 

Wait, let's parse that. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nx / ny) - log10(nx_sun / ny_sun). 

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. That means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] = 0 → log(Fe/H star / Fe/H sun) = 0 → Fe/H star = Fe/H sun. Same with Star_2's [Mg/H] = 0, so Mg in Star_2 is same as Sun. 

And for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So log (Si/Fe star1 / Si/Fe sun) = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun. 

Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3. So log (Mg/Si star2 / Mg/Si sun) = 0.3 → Mg/Si star2 = 10^0.3 × Mg/Si sun.

Wait, but how do I find the ratio of silicon in the two stars? The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So I think that's [Si/total], but perhaps it's the ratio of Si in Star_1 vs. Star_2.

Wait, no. The problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

Alternatively, maybe it's (n_Si,1 / H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 / H,2), which would be [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2. Because the ratio of silicon atoms would be (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) * (n_H,2 / n_Si,2). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. 

Wait, let's think in terms of each element's abundance. Let me denote the Sun's abundance of an element X as X_sun. The Sun's [X/H] is therefore log10(n_X/n_H) + some constant, as given. 

So for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, which matches, because that's the reference.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe_1 / H_1 = Fe_sun / H_sun → Fe_1 = same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si_1/Fe_1) = 10^0.3 × (Si_sun / Fe_sun). 

So Si_1 / Fe_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si_sun/Fe_sun).

We can write Si_sun/Fe_sun = [Si/Fe]_sun. But wait, what is [Si/Fe]_sun? Well, since [X/Y] = log( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ), then [Si/Fe]_sun would be 0. But wait, if I'm already using the Sun's values, perhaps I can compute the actual ratios.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express each element's abundance in terms of H.

Let me consider each star's elements in terms of H.

Star_1:

Fe_1 / H_1 = Fe_sun / H_sun → Fe_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

But H_1 is the hydrogen in Star_1. Since the total number of particles is roughly the same, but perhaps we can assume that H is the same in both stars as we're comparing ratios. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because [Fe/H]_1 is zero, it means the metallicity (Fe abundance relative to H) is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun). But wait, no, [Fe/H] tells us that the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So Fe_1 / H_1 = Fe_sun / H_sun → Fe_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

But without knowing H_1 and H_2, how can we proceed? Alternatively, perhaps we can express the abundances as [X/H], which is log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X_sun / n_H_sun). 

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → log(Fe_1/H_1) - log(Fe_sun/H_sun) =0 → Fe_1/H_1 = Fe_sun/H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) - log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) =0.3 → Si_1/Fe_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun).

So, Si_1 = Fe_1 * 10^0.3 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun).

But since Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun), substituting:

Si_1 = (Fe_sun * H_1 / H_sun) * 10^0.3 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) ) = H_1 / H_sun * 10^0.3 * Si_sun.

So Si_1 = (H_1 / H_sun) * 10^0.3 * Si_sun.

But how does that relate to the Sun's Si?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's express each element's abundance relative to H.

For the Sun:

n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5) → [Fe/H]_sun = -4.5.

Wait no, the notation is [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun). Since for the Sun, it's 12 + log(n_X/n_H) = given value, so [X/H] for the Sun would be log(n_X,n_sun /n_H,n_sun) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun) → which is zero. Wait, no:

Wait, the problem says for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0. So the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, which makes sense.

Similarly, for Mg, [Mg/H]_sun is 0.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → same [Fe/H] as the Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

So (Si/Fe)_star1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

But the Sun's [Si/Fe] is 0 by default, so (Si/Fe)_sun = 10^0 =1.

Wait, no, [Si/Fe]_sun is log( (Si_sun/Fe_sun) / (Si_sun/Fe_sun) )=0 → (Si_sun/Fe_sun) =10^0=1.

So for Star_1, (Si/Fe)_1 =10^0.3 *1 = approx 2. So Si_1 = 2 Fe_1.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is same as Sun, Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

So Si_1 = 2 * Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

But the Sun's Si is Si_sun = Fe_sun * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) = Fe_sun * 1 = Fe_sun.

So Si_1 = 2 Fe_1 = 2 * Fe_sun * (H_1/H_sun) → which is 2 * (Fe_sun * H_1 / H_sun) → and since Si_sun=Fe_sun, Si_1=2*(H_1/H_sun) * Si_sun.

But how does this help me? Maybe I should express Si_1 in terms of H.

From Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(Si_1/Fe_1) - log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) =0.3 → which gives (Si_1/Fe_1) = 10^0.3 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) → which is 2 as before.

But since Fe_1/H_1 = Fe_sun/H_sun → Fe_1 = Fe_sun*(H_1/H_sun).

So Si_1 = 2 * Fe_1 = 2 * Fe_sun * (H_1/H_sun).

But Si_sun = Fe_sun → so Si_1 = 2 * (Fe_sun) * (H_1/H_sun) → which is 2*(H_1/H_sun) * Si_sun.

So Si_1 = (2 H_1 / H_sun) * Si_sun.

So the ratio (Si_1 / H_1) = (2 H_1 / H_sun * Si_sun) / H_1 ) → 2 Si_sun / H_sun.

Wait, that can't be. Because (2 H_1 / H_sun) * Si_sun / H_1 = 2 Si_sun / H_sun.

But (Si_sun / H_sun) is a constant. Let me call that S_sun = Si_sun / H_sun.

So Star_1's Si_1 / H_1 = 2 * S_sun.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = log( (Si_1/H_1) / (Si_sun / H_sun) ) → log(2) → which is about 0.3 dex.

Wait, but Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, but we haven't been given [Si/H] for Star_1. Hmm, perhaps this approach is complicating things.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for both stars.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → so [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] = 0 +0.3 = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg/H same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/H] = [Si/H] + [Mg/Si].

Wait, no. Let me think.

[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (Si_1/H_1) / (Si_2/H_2) = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} }.

Wait, because [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X, sun /n_H, sun ).

So (n_X/n_H)_star = 10^{ [X/H]_star } × (n_X_sun /n_H_sun).

So the ratio (n_X,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_X,2 /n_H,2 ) = [ (10^{[X/H]_1} * X_sun/H_sun) / (10^{[X/H]_2} * X_sun/H_sun) ) ] × (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )

Wait, but H_1 and H_2 are the hydrogen in each star. Unless the stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms, which I don't think we can assume. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but perhaps since the stars are in LTE, their photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, but the problem says to use the EW method to determine elemental abundances, which is a standard method, so the [X/H] values account for the overall metallicity.

Wait, but for the purpose of the ratio of silicon, perhaps we can assume that the hydrogen in each star is the same as the Sun. No, that's not correct because [X/H] already considers the star's own H.

Wait, maybe the ratio of silicon is (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) × (n_H,2 / n_H,1).

Because (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2) = (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2) × (n_H,2 / n_H,1).

But without knowing the ratio of H in the stars, this approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2), regardless of H. But that would be just [Si]_1 - [Si]_2. But we don't have [Si] for each star, only [Si/Fe], [Fe/H], etc.

Wait, perhaps I should find [Si/H] for each star.

As I thought earlier, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2) = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) * (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ).

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let me think about the solar ratios.

For the Sun, [X/H] is 0 for both Fe and Mg, since [Fe/H]_sun =0 and [Mg/H]_sun=0.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe_1/H_1 = Fe_sun / H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → Si_1/Fe_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si_sun/Fe_sun) → since Si_sun/Fe_sun=1, as [Si/Fe]_sun is 0.

So Si_1/Fe_1 = 2.

So Si_1 = 2 Fe_1.

Fe_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

So Si_1 = 2*(Fe_sun * H_1 / H_sun) = 2*(Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

But Si_sun = Fe_sun → so [Si_1 = 2*(Fe_sun/H_sun)*H_1 ].

So Si_1 = 2 * (Fe_sun * H_1 ) / H_sun = 2 * (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

But (Fe_sun/H_sun) is the solar Fe/H ratio, which is 3.16e-5 as we calculated earlier.

So, [n_Si,1] = 2 * (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

But what about Star_2?

Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → Mg_2/H_2 = Mg_sun / H_sun.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (Mg_2/Si_2) = 10^0.3 × (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

Since Mg_sun/Si_sun is (Mg_sun / H_sun) / (Si_sun / H_sun) = (Mg/H)_sun / (Si/H)_sun.

Wait, we know for the Sun, [Mg/H]_sun is 0, which is log(Mg/H_sun), but wait, no.

Wait, [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun) → For [Mg/H]_sun, it's 0, which implies n_Mg/n_H = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (Mg_2/Si_2) = 10^0.3 × (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

So, Mg_2 = 10^0.3 × (Mg_sun/Si_sun) × Si_2.

But Mg_2/H_2 = Mg_sun/H_sun → Mg_2 = Mg_sun × H_2 / H_sun.

So substituting:

Mg_sun × H_2 / H_sun = 10^0.3 × (Mg_sun/Si_sun) × Si_2.

Divide both sides by Mg_sun:

H_2 / H_sun = 10^0.3 × (1/Si_sun) × Si_2.

So, Si_2 = (H_2 / H_sun) × Si_sun × 10^-0.3.

Because 10^0.3 is on the right, so 10^-0.3 on the left.

So Si_2 = (H_2 / H_sun) × Si_sun × 10^-0.3.

Hmm, now I have expressions for Si_1 and Si_2 in terms of H_1 and H_2.

The ratio of silicon in the two stars would be (Si_1)/(Si_2) = [2 (Fe_sun/H_sun) H_1 ] / [ (H_2 / H_sun) Si_sun × 10^-0.3 ].

Wait, but since Si_sun = Fe_sun (from the Sun's [Si/Fe]=0), then Si_sun = Fe_sun.

So substituting Si_sun = Fe_sun, the expression becomes:

[2 (Fe_sun/H_sun) H_1 ] / [ (H_2 / H_sun) Fe_sun × 10^-0.3 ].

The Fe_sun cancels out:

[2 (H_1 / H_sun) ] / [ (H_2 / H_sun) × 10^-0.3 ]

Which simplifies to:

2 * (H_1 / H_sun) * (H_sun / H_2 ) * 10^0.3.

So that's 2 * (H_1/H_2) * 10^0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know H_1 and H_2.

Wait, but since both stars are main sequence stars, perhaps their masses can help us estimate their H content.

Wait, the problem gives the masses as 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But I'm not sure how that relates to the photospheric H content.

Wait, for main-sequence stars, mass is correlated with luminosity and temperature, but the overall metal content (H and He) isn't necessarily directly given. Unless we make the assumption that the stars have the same initial composition as the Sun, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the hydrogen density ratio is the same as the mass ratio. But that's probably not accurate.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So it's n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

But based on the abundances given, perhaps I can express this ratio directly using the [Si/H] values.

Because [Si/H] is the logarithm of (n_Si/n_H) relative to the Sun.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) =10^0.3 × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → (n_Si,2 /n_H,2) =10^-0.3 × (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

Thus, the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2) = (n_Si,1/n_H,1) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2) ) × (n_H,2 /n_H,1) ).

Which is [ (10^0.3 × S_sun) / (10^-0.3 × S_sun) ) ] × (H_2 / H_1 ), where S_sun is (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun).

The S_sun cancels, so we get 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) ) × (H_2 / H_1) → 10^0.6 × (H_2/H_1).

Which is about 3.98 × (H_2/H_1).

So the ratio is approximately 4 times (H_2 / H_1).

But without knowing H_2 and H_1, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the stars have the same metallicity in terms of H. Or perhaps the H content is the same as the Sun, which would make H_1 = H_sun and H_2 = H_sun. But that's not correct because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, implying Fe is same as Sun, but H could vary.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that H_1 and H_2 are the same as the Sun since the stars are similar. But that's a big assumption.

Wait, let's think about the [X/H] values again. [X/H] is the logarithm of (n_X/n_H) for the star compared to the Sun.

If [X/H] is positive, the element is more abundant relative to H in the star than in the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3 → more Si relative to H than the Sun.

Star_2's [Si/H] is -0.3 → less Si relative to H than the Sun.

So the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2) = [ (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2) ) ] × (n_H,2 /n_H,1).

Which is (10^0.3 /10^-0.3) × (n_H,2 /n_H,1) → 10^0.6 × (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ) ≈3.98 × (n_H,2 /n_H,1).

But without knowing H_1 and H_2, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same total number of particles as the Sun. But that's probably not the case, unless they're the same radius and temperature, which they're not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the H ratio and just compute the [Si/H] ratio, leading to a ratio of ~4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is about 10^0.6 (which is ~3.98). So if H_2/H_1 is 1, then the ratio is ~3.98.

But wait, why would H_2/H_1 be 1? The stars are more massive, but that doesn't necessarily mean more hydrogen. Unless the stars are on the main sequence, but I don't think that's directly helpful here.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the hydrogen content scales with the star's mass. So for Star_1, mass 1.5 solar masses, so H_1 = 1.5 × H_sun. Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses, so H_2=1.2 × H_sun.

If that's the case, then H_2/H_1 = (1.2/1.5) = 0.8.

Then the ratio (Si_1/Si_2) = 3.98 × 0.8 ≈3.184 → which is about 3.2, but that's not one of the options. The options are 3.9, 12.6, 0.8, 1.2.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the ratio of H is the inverse because higher mass stars have higher H? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the H content is inversely related to the mass? No, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is simply (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) = 10^0.6 ≈3.98, and the answer is option A.

But why? Because maybe the H content in each star is the same as the Sun, so H_1 = H_2 = H_sun. Then the ratio of (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2) =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~3.9. So perhaps that's the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition as a reference.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → Silicon is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.
   - Using the Sun's [Si/Fe] = 0, this implies [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → Mg abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → Mg is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.
   - Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we find [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex.

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - [Si/H]_sun = 0 dex (by definition).

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}\right)} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]

Using the logarithmic abundance ratios:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1} \cdot n_{\text{Si,H,sun}},
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2} \cdot n_{\text{Si,H,sun}}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,H,sun}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,H,sun}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]

Here, \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\). Assuming the hydrogen content scales with the stars' masses (a reasonable approximation for main-sequence stars), we estimate:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{1.2}{1.5} = 0.8.
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.98 \cdot 0.8 \approx 3.18.
\]

However, if we assume the hydrogen content is the same for both stars (a simpler assumption), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
