Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? We take the speed of light in a vacuum, c, as 1.

Hmm, so the setup is about relative velocities of the glass and the light. I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially involving light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, this is about the speed of light in a medium, not in a vacuum. Oh, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is the ratio of c to the speed in the medium (v_medium = c/n).

Wait, but the glass itself is moving. So the observer in the lab is seeing the glass moving towards them, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but that's for when you're transforming velocities from one frame to another. But here, the medium (glass) is moving, and the light is within that medium.

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, perhaps the observed speed is the speed of the light in the glass plus the speed of the glass itself? But that might not be correct because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Or wait, no. Because the medium is moving, but the speed of light in the medium is v_light = c/n. So would the observer in the lab see the light moving at v_light + v?

Wait, but that would be a Galilean addition, which is only valid at non-relativistic speeds. But since the problem doesn’t specify the speed v, maybe it's assumed to be non-relativistic. But in reality, for light, we need to use relativistic velocity addition.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light. Then, what's the speed in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light?

In special relativity, the velocity of an object in one frame (u') is related to another frame (u) by the Lorentz transformation. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²).

Wait, applying that here, the light's speed in the glass frame (u') is c/n. So u' = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the speed of the light in the lab frame (u) would be (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²). But wait, wait, I think I might have the direction wrong. Let me think: if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then the lab frame would perceive the light's velocity as u = (u' + v_glass) / (1 + (u' * v_glass)/c²), where u' is the speed of light in the glass.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write it out.

In the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion in the lab frame (S). The glass is moving at velocity v relative to S (lab frame). So, to find u, the speed of light as observed in S, we use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c² )

Plugging u' = c/n:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u = [ (c + n v) / (n) ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator again. The denominator is 1 + (u' v)/c². So substituting u' = c/n:

( (c/n) * v ) / c² = (v)/(n c)

So denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c ) = [n c + v ]/(n c )

So the entire expression for u becomes:

u = [ (c + n v )/(n) ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is the same as [ (c + n v) / n ] * [n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels:

= [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Wait, the numerator is c (c + n v ), denominator is (n c + v )

Wait, so u = [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v )

But since c is 1, let's substitute that:

u = [1*(1 + n v ) ] / (n *1 + v )

So u = (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Hmm, so that's the expression.

Looking back at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which matches what I got.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, would the relative speed be higher than c/n? Because the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so the light's speed in the lab frame would be v_light plus v_glass, but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, but according to the calculation using the relativistic addition formula, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ). So that's the correct option.

Wait, but what if I approach this another way? Suppose the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. The glass is moving at v. So in the lab, the light's speed is the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass. But that's the Galilean addition, which would give (c/n + v). But that's not considering relativity, which is needed when speeds are significant compared to c. But in the problem, v is a constant velocity, but we don't know its magnitude. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A. Let me check if that aligns with the options.

Yes, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ). So that's the answer.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the refractive index of the glass is \( n \). The speed of light in the glass is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass (rest frame of the glass),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) \cdot v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression for \( u \) becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this reduces to:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]
