Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is broken down into its X, Y, and Z components, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators. For a spin-½ particle like a muon, the spin operator components are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The general form for the spin operator along a direction n (which is in the x-z plane here, so n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)) would be something like S = (ħ/2) (σ_x sinθ cosφ + σ_y * 0 + σ_z cosθ). Since n is in x-z, the y-component is zero, so the operator simplifies to S = (ħ/2) (σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ), right?

Wait, but the problem gives the components Px, Py, Pz as specific matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the standard Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], again the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2. Pz is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], Pauli Z scaled by ħ/2.

So the operator P is the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector. Since the direction is arbitrary in x-z, the operator would be P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Wait no, actually, the operator for spin along direction n is given by S·n, where S is the vector of spin operators. So S·n = Sx nx + Sy ny + Sz nz. Since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero, so it's Sx nx + Sz nz.

In this case, the operator P is the spin operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the matrix form of P is (ħ/2) (nx σ_x + nz σ_z), where nx and nz are the direction cosines. Since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

Hmm. The eigenvectors of the spin operator S·n for eigenvalue +ħ/2 are the spin-up states along direction n. These are typically written as a superposition of the spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis.

Wait, but the problem states that n lies in the x-z plane. That might mean that the direction is parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) in x, y, z. So the operator becomes P = (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z).

So the matrix for P would be (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you add sinθ σ_x and cosθ σ_z, you get [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]. Multiplying by ħ/2 gives the full operator.

So we're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So let me write the matrix equation:

( (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Since the eigenvalue is ħ/2, I can factor that out, so we have:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

Wait, no, more accurately, the equation is:

( (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix M = sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

So M is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So we want to find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue +1.

Because our equation is M |ψ> = |ψ>, so the eigenvalue is 1.

To find the eigenvectors, we'll set up (M - I)|ψ> = 0.

So the matrix M - I is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

We can write this as:

Row 1: (cosθ -1) * a + sinθ * b = 0
Row 2: sinθ * a + (-cosθ -1) * b = 0

We can write these as two equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Let me pick the first equation to express a in terms of b.

From equation 1: a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] * b

Wait, because (cosθ -1) is -(1 - cosθ), so:

(cosθ -1) a = -(1 - cosθ) a.

So (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → -(1 - cosθ) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] * b.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to factor using trigonometric identities. 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting these:

a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] * b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] * b
= cot(θ/2) * b

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [ cot(θ/2) * b, b ]^T.

We can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [cot(θ/2), 1]^T.

But wait, this may be in terms of θ, but the question is about the normalized eigenvector, so I need to find the elements in terms of θ or other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates or other variables. Let me think about another approach.

Another approach: the eigenvectors of spin in an arbitrary direction are given by the spin coherent states, which can be written in terms of rotations from the z-axis. The spin-up state along n can be written as:

|ψ> = e^{-i φ S_z} e^{i θ S_y} |↑>

Wait, but since n is in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So the state would be e^{i θ S_y} |↑> ?

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I should think about the rotation operators. To align the spin along an arbitrary direction, you can rotate from the z-axis to that direction. For a direction in the x-z plane, the rotation would be about the y-axis by an angle θ. So the state can be written as R_y(θ)|↑>, where R is the rotation operator.

The rotation operator about y by θ is given by exp(-i θ S_y / ħ). So for a spin-½ particle, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So R_y(θ) = exp( -i θ (σ_y/2) ).

But perhaps more importantly, the spin-up state along n is given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

Since in this case, n is in the x-z plane, so φ = 0. So the state becomes:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>

Because when you rotate around y by angle θ (from z to n direction), the state becomes a combination of |↑> and |↓> with coefficients involving cos and sin of θ/2.

Wait, let me confirm. For a general spin-½ system, the eigenstate along direction (θ, φ) is given by:

|+> = e^{-i φ S_z} [ cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{i φ} sin(θ/2)|↓> ]

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0. So it simplifies to:

|+> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>

Expressed as a column vector, this would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvector I found earlier from the matrix approach was proportional to [cot(θ/2), 1]^T, which would be [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ]^T. So when normalized, it's [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T multiplied by 1/sqrt( [cos^2 + sin^2] ) = 1, so that's the normalized eigenvector.

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, the options are written as:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2/2))?

Wait, no, looking back, the options are:

Option C) (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)) – no, wait, the user wrote the options as:

Looking back, the options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but the eigenvector I derived is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along the x-z direction is often written as such, right? So that's probably option C. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option B is more like a spherical coordinate expression, but it's not necessarily normalized. For example, in spherical coordinates, you have r = 1, so cosθ and sinθ would be in the vector, but it's expressed as (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which might be a direction in some other basis.

Wait, option C is the same as what I got. But looking at the matrix approach, the eigenvector was [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T. Let's compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix approach.

Wait, let's redo the matrix approach. The matrix M is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

And we're looking for eigenvectors where M |v> = |v>. So the eigenvalue is 1.

The determinant of (M - I) is (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sinθ^2.

Which is [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) ] - sin^2θ.

Multiply it out: (-cos^2θ -cosθ + cosθ +1 ) - sin^2θ.

= (-cos^2θ + 1 ) - sin^2θ.

But 1 - cos^2θ is sin^2θ, so:

= sin^2θ - sin^2θ = 0.

So the equations are consistent, as expected.

So the system is:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can take a = 1 (for simplicity) and solve for b.

From the first equation: (cosθ -1) + sinθ b = 0 → b = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Which is [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2).

So b = tan(theta/2).

Wait, so the eigenvector is [1, tan(theta/2)]^T. To normalize this, compute the magnitude:

sqrt(1^2 + [tan(theta/2)]^2) ) = sqrt( 1 + tan^2(theta/2) ) = sqrt( sec^2(theta/2) ) ) = |sec(theta/2)| = 1 / cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [1, tan(theta/2)]^T / (1 / cos(theta/2)) ) = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Because [1 * cos(theta/2), tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) ] → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So yes, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly this. So the answer should be C. Wait, but what about the other options?

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but that would imply a specific angle. For example, if theta is such that cos(theta/2) = sqrt(2/3) and sin(theta/2) = sqrt(1/3), but that's only for a particular theta, which might not be the case here. Since the direction is arbitrary, the eigenvector should depend on theta, so option C is general.

Option B is parametrized with theta and phi, but in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} would be 1. So option B becomes (cos theta, sin theta), but that's a different parametrization. Hmm. Wait, that would be the direction vector of the unit vector in spherical coordinates. But the eigenvector isn't the direction vector; it's a state vector in the spin space.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the spin state with the direction of the vector n. The eigenvector is a spin state, not the direction vector. So option B would be the components of n, but that's not the same as the spin state. So option B is not the spin state.

Option A has ħ factors, but in our calculation, the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector since spin states are normalized vectors. So option A is probably incorrect because it's scaling the components by ħ, which would have units of angular momentum. So the eigenvector shouldn't have units of ħ; it's a pure number.

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the spin operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized by an angle $\theta$ from the z-axis, as the problem specifies that $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Formulation**:  
   The spin operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z)$, where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the Pauli matrices, the operator can be written as:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}\right) 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}
   = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}
   = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector**:  
   Subtracting the identity matrix from the operator matrix, we get:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix}
   = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   From the first row, $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$. Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:
   \[
   a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b.
   \]
   Substituting $a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b$ into the second row confirms consistency. The eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\
   \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1$.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ factors, which are inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors.  
   - **Option B**: Parametrizes the components as $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$, which corresponds to the direction vector $\vec{n}$, not the spin state.  
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$.  
   - **Option D**: Introduces additional coefficients $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the general solution.

### Conclusion:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.
