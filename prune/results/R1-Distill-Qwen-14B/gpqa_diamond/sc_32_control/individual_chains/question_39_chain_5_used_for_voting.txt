Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position of the particles, none are found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding the particle. The total probability over all space must equal 1 because the particle must be somewhere. So I think I need to normalize the wave function.

Wait, but the wave function here has a real part and an imaginary part. Oh right, the probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function, which is |ψ(x)|². So I need to compute this and then integrate from x=1 to x=3 because that's where the particles are found.

But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. 

The square modulus is |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number like A + Bi, the modulus squared is A² + B². So here, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but this is for each x. So the total probability is the integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3, and this should equal 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me set that up:

Integral (from 1 to 3) [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this into two separate integrals:

a² * ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 * ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute each part.

The first integral: ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that's ln(2).

The second integral is ∫ dx from 1 to 3, which is 2 (since 3-1=2).

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's ln(2)? It's approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213. Then a is the square root of that. Let me compute sqrt(0.7213).

Wait, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, because 0.85² is 0.7225, which is close to 0.7213. Hmm, 0.85 squared is 0.7225. So 0.85^2 is 0.7225, which is just a bit more than 0.7213. So maybe the square root is around 0.849 or something. But looking at the options, B is 0.85, which is close. Another option is D) 0.6, but that's much smaller.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

0.5 / ln(2) = 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213.

a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close to 0.849. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the integral.

The first part:

The integral of 1/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is indeed ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), correct.

The second term: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5. That's correct.

So the equation a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. So the equation is correct.

So a² = (1-0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5/(0.6931) ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

So the closest option is B) 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we normalize the given wave function. The wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the square modulus of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability must equal 1. Thus, we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

1. For the first term, the integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

2. For the second term, the integral of \( 1 \) over \( x \) is simply the length of the interval:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} dx = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

Substituting these results back into the equation:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Take the square root to find \( a \):

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to \( 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
