Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is about calculating the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If X is Li with 3 neutrons, that means the isotope is Li-6 because the number of protons is 3 and neutrons are 3, so 3+3=6. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, adding 3 neutrons gives a total of 6 nucleons. So yes, the nucleus is Li-6. So I'll need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

But wait, in particle physics, when dealing with energy, we often use the rest mass energy. So I'll need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it using the atomic mass of lithium-6.

The formula for the relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 c², right? Gamma is the Lorentz factor. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Let me calculate gamma first. v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, correct. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Hmm, but let me double-check the calculation. 0.96c is v. So (v²/c²) is 0.96² = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. So the energy E is gamma times m0 c squared. Wait, but m0 is the rest mass of the nucleus. So I need to find the rest mass energy of a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but wait. How do I find the rest mass of Li-6? I think the atomic mass of a Li-6 atom is approximately 6.014 atomic mass units (amu). But wait, the atomic mass is the mass of the atom, including electrons. Since the nucleus is just protons and neutrons, I need to account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the mass of a single nucleon. Since Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), each with an average mass. The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate mass given by the sum of the masses of its nucleons.

Wait, but wait. Let's think. The mass number is 6, so 6 nucleons. So each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So assuming 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass would be 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV/c²? No, wait, that can't be right. Because each neutron and proton have slightly different masses, but when you have a nucleus, there is a binding energy, so the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons. But wait, in this case, perhaps we're using the rest mass of the nucleus, which includes the binding energy as a negative contribution (mass deficit).

But maybe for this problem, we can approximate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look up the precise mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014101918 amu. But wait, the atomic mass includes electrons. So to get the mass of the nucleus, I need to subtract the mass of the electrons.

Wait, a Li atom has 3 electrons. So for Li-6, each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 amu. So 3 electrons would be approximately 0.00164574 amu. So subtracting that from the atomic mass gives the mass of the nucleus.

So the mass of Li-6 nucleus would be 6.014101918 amu - 3 * 0.00054858 amu.

Let me compute that: 6.014101918 - 0.00164574 = 6.012456178 amu.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014102 amu. So 3 electrons are 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 amu. So subtracting that, 6.014102 minus 0.00164574.

6.014102 - 0.00164574 = 6.01245626 amu. So approximately 6.012456 amu.

Now, I need to convert this mass into energy. But wait, the energy we're calculating is the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma times m0 c².

So first, I need to find m0, which is the rest mass of the nucleus. So m0 is 6.012456 amu.

Now, 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m0 in MeV/c² is 6.012456 * 931.5 ≈ let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 is 5589. 0.012456 * 931.5 ≈ let's see, 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315, 0.002456 * 931.5 ≈ roughly 2.282. So total is 9.315 + 2.282 = 11.597. So adding to 5589, we get 5589 + 11.597 = 5600.597 MeV.

Wait, wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately:

6.012456 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.012456 * 931.5 = 0.012456 * 931.5.

Let me compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315.

0.002456 * 931.5 = ?

0.002 *931.5 = 1.863.

0.000456 *931.5 ≈ 0.4233.

So 1.863 + 0.4233 = 2.2863.

Adding 9.315 and 2.2863 gives 11.6013.

So total m0 c² is 5589 + 11.6013 = 5600.6013 MeV. Which is 5.6006 GeV approximately.

Wait, wait—because 5589 MeV is 5.589 GeV. 5.589 + 0.0116013 GeV is about 5.6006 GeV.

Wait, wait no, wait: 5600.6013 MeV is 5.6006 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5600.6013 MeV is 5.6006 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting the rest mass energy as approximately 5.6006 GeV. So m0 c² is 5.6006 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times m0 c². Gamma is approximately 3.5714, as calculated earlier.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.6006 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.6006.

Let me compute 3.5 * 5.6 = 19.6. But more accurately:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284.

Adding them together: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 (approximately) but wait more accurately:

Wait, 3.5714 *5.6 = ?

Well, 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

So total is 17.857 +2.14284 = 19.99984 GeV. Approximately 20 GeV.

Wait, but let me check with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.5714 *5.6006.

Let me compute 3 *5.6006 =16.8018.

0.5714 *5.6006 = ?

0.5 *5.6006 = 2.8003.

0.0714 *5.6006 ≈ 0.0714 *5=0.357, 0.0714*0.6006≈0.0429. So total around 0.357 +0.0429 =0.3999.

So 2.8003 + 0.3999 ≈ 3.2002.

Adding to 16.8018, total is 16.8018 +3.2002 = 20.002 GeV.

So E ≈20.002 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. I might have made a mistake in calculating the mass of the nucleus.

Let me double-check the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Because I subtracted the electrons, but perhaps I should have considered the binding energy as well. However, the rest mass of the nucleus is indeed given by the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy (mass defect). Wait, but when I calculated the nucleus mass as 6.012456 amu, that includes the binding energy, right? Because the atomic mass is higher than the sum of nucleons' masses due to binding energy? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, no, I'm confused. Let's clarify:

The atomic mass of a nucleus (like Li-6) includes the mass of the nucleus plus the mass of the electrons. So to get the mass of the nucleus alone (the actual rest mass of the nucleus), you subtract the mass of the electrons.

So the atomic mass of Li is 6.014102 amu, which is the mass of the atom (nucleus plus electrons). So to get the nucleus mass, I subtract the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron is about 0.00054858 amu. So 3 electrons: 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 amu.

So 6.014102 - 0.00164574 = 6.01245626 amu. So that's correct.

Now, 1 amu is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.01245626 amu * 931.5 MeV/c²/amu.

Calculating that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01245626 * 931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.00245626 *931.5 ≈ let me compute:

0.002 *931.5=1.863.

0.00045626 *931.5= approx 0.424.

So 1.863 +0.424=2.287.

So 9.315 +2.287=11.602 MeV.

So total m0 c² is 5589 + 11.602 = 5600.602 MeV = 5.6006 GeV.

So E=gamma*m0*c²=3.5714 *5.6006 GeV.

Wait, 3.5714 *5.6006.

Let me compute it accurately.

3.5714 *5.6006 = ?

Let me write it as (3 + 0.5714) *5.6006.

3*5.6006=16.8018.

0.5714 *5.6006.

Compute 0.5 *5.6006 =2.8003.

0.0714 *5.6006 ≈0.0714 *5=0.357, 0.0714 *0.6006≈0.0429.

So 0.357 +0.0429=0.3999.

So 2.8003 + 0.3999=3.2002.

So total E=16.8018 +3.2002=20.002 GeV.

Hmm, but the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So my calculation gives about 20.002 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit off. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating gamma.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of gamma.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²= (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, correct.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think: the exact atomic mass might be 6.014101918 amu.

So 6.014101918 - 0.00164574 =6.012456178 amu.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check that. Because perhaps the Li-6 nucleus has a mass that's a bit different when considering binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus in MeV/c².

Wait, from what I remember, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.603 GeV/c². Hmm, that would make the E about 3.5714 *5.603 ≈20.01 GeV. But that's not matching the options exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is not exactly 6 nucleons. Wait, no—Li-6 has 6 nucleons, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of 1 amu in terms of MeV. 1 amu is approximately 931.494 MeV/c².

So m0 =6.012456 amu *931.494 MeV/c²/amu.

So 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.012456 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.002456 *931.494= approximately 2.2835.

So 9.31494 +2.2835=11.5984.

Total m0 c²=5588.964+11.5984=5600.5624 MeV, which is 5.6005624 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6005624 GeV.

Let me compute this product more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6005624.

Let me compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.6005624.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5.6005624.

Let me approximate 3.57142857 as 35/10 × 35/10 = 3.5 ×3.5 = 12.25, but maybe a better way.

Alternatively, 3.57142857 is 25/7 ≈3.5714286.

So 25/7 *5.6005624 = ?

5.6005624 ×25 =140.01406.

140.01406 /7 ≈20.00201.

Hmm, that's about 20.002 GeV.

But the options are C)20.132 and D)21.419.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me try to compute it again.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass. Let's take the exact atomic mass of Li-6 from a reliable source.

Looking it up (though in reality I can't, but for the sake of this problem), I'll assume the exact value is 6.014101918 amu. So mass of nucleus is 6.014101918 - 3*(0.00054858) =6.014101918 - 0.00164574 =6.012456178 amu.

Multiplying by 931.494 MeV/amu:

6.012456178 *931.494 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.012456178 *931.494 = Let's compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.002456178 *931.494 ≈ let me compute 0.002 *931.494=1.862988.

0.000456178 *931.494≈0.000456178 *900=0.4105602, and 0.000456178 *31.494≈0.0143503. So total about 0.4105602 +0.0143503=0.4249105.

So 0.002456178 *931.494 ≈1.862988+0.4249105=2.2878985.

So 9.31494 +2.2878985=11.6028385.

Adding to 5588.964 gives 5588.964 +11.6028385=5600.5668385 MeV, which is 5.6005668385 GeV.

So m0 c²=5.6005668 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6005668.

Calculating it:

3.57142857 *5.6005668.

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6005668.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0005668 ≈ 0.002026.

So 2.142857142 +0.002026 ≈2.144883.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.144883 =20.00202585 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.002 GeV. But the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

1/0.28=3.57142857. Correct.

So gamma is accurate.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me think: perhaps I should have considered the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) minus the binding energy. But wait, the method I used earlier subtracts the electrons from the atomic mass to get the nucleus mass. Maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass I'm using is incorrect. Let me think: maybe the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 5.604 GeV/c². Let me try that.

E=3.57142857 *5.604.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.604= Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142, 3.57142857 ×0.004=0.014285714.

Adding gives 2.142857142 +0.014285714=2.157142856.

So E=17.85714285 +2.157142856=20.0142857 GeV.

Still close to 20 GeV.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should use the mass in u (atomic mass units) more accurately.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 5.604 GeV, and gamma is 3.57142857, so E is 5.604 *3.57142857.

Let me compute that: 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.604 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.004 *3.57142857≈0.01428571.

So 2.142857142 +0.01428571≈2.15714285.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.15714285=20.0142857 GeV.

Still, that's around 20.014 GeV.

Hmm. The options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419

So the closest is option C)20.132. But why isn't our calculation matching it?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass of the nucleus. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach:

The mass of the nucleus can be calculated using the formula:

Mass of nucleus = (Z * m_p + (A-Z) * m_n) - binding energy.

But perhaps I should use the exact values for the proton and neutron masses.

The proton mass m_p=938.272 MeV/c².

The neutron mass m_n=939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, Z=3, A=6, so neutrons=3.

So mass of nucleus = 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) - binding energy.

But wait, actually, the binding energy is the mass defect, so the actual mass is (sum of individual nucleons) - (binding energy in MeV/c²).

Wait, but in reality, the binding energy is given by the mass defect, which is the difference between the sum of the individual nucleon masses and the actual nucleus mass.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the sum and then subtract the actual mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the theoretical mass without binding energy and see.

So sum of protons and neutrons: 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV.

Now, the actual nucleus mass is 5600.5668 MeV (from earlier calculation). So the binding energy is 5633.511 -5600.5668=32.9442 MeV.

Wait, but that's the binding energy. But how does that help me? I think that's a side note.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the exact mass of the nucleus in terms of MeV. From earlier, m0 c² is 5.6005668 GeV.

Hmm. So gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.6005668 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.6005668.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6005668.

Breaking it down:

3 ×5.6005668 =16.8017004.

0.57142857 ×5.6005668.

Compute 0.5 ×5.6005668=2.8002834.

0.07142857 ×5.6005668≈0.07142857 ×5=0.35714285.

0.07142857 ×0.6005668≈0.042910.

So 0.35714285 +0.042910≈0.399, approximately.

So 2.8002834 +0.399=3.1992834.

Adding to 16.8017004: 16.8017004 +3.1992834=20.0009838 GeV.

So approximately 20.001 GeV.

Hmm. So the calculation gives about 20.001 GeV, but the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the question is referring to the kinetic energy instead of the total energy? Because sometimes in such problems, people confuse total energy (which includes rest mass) with kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)", which I believe refers to the total energy, including rest mass. Because colliders typically accelerate particles to high energies, which is their total energy (gamma m c²).

But perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy. Wait, the problem states, "What is the energy of the RHIC that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So it's about the energy imparted by the collider, which is the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy?

Hmm. Let me think. The total energy is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m c².

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which I calculated as approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass was miscalculated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so gamma is 3.5714. So the total energy is gamma m c². But perhaps the rest mass is not 5.6005 GeV but higher.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus in GeV/c².

Upon checking (hypothetically, since I can't access external data), I find that the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.603 GeV/c².

So E =3.5714 *5.603 ≈20.01 GeV.

Still, that's close to 20 GeV.

But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the gamma calculation.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.96²) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857. Correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: maybe the question is using a different reference for the mass, like the proton's rest mass.

Wait, but no, the nucleus is Li-6, so it's a much heavier particle.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed given is such that beta is 0.96, but perhaps the calculation uses a different approach, like using the relativistic work-energy theorem where the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c², but I think the question refers to the total energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I correctly calculated the total energy as about 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 5.608 GeV/c².

Let me try 5.608 GeV.

E=3.5714 *5.608 ≈3.5714 *5=17.857.

3.5714 *0.608=2.172.

So total is 20.029 GeV.

Hmm, that's closer to option C)20.132.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of the rest mass is 5.608 GeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact mass using the exact atomic mass.

Wait, atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014101918 amu.

Subtracting 3 electrons: 6.014101918 - 3*(0.00054858) =6.014101918 -0.00164574=6.012456178 amu.

So 6.012456178 amu *931.494 MeV/amu = ?

Let's compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.012456178 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.002456178 *931.494.

0.002 *931.494=1.862988.

0.000456178 *931.494≈0.000456178 *900=0.4105602; 0.000456178 *31.494≈0.0143503.

So 0.4105602 +0.0143503=0.4249105.

So 1.862988 +0.4249105=2.2878985.

So 9.31494 +2.2878985=11.6028385 MeV.

So total m0 c²=5588.964 +11.6028385 =5600.5668385 MeV=5.6005668 GeV.

So E=3.5714 *5.6005668 GeV=20.001 GeV.

Hmm. So the calculation is correct. But the only option close is C)20.132.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the speed. Oh wait, wait a second: the speed is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options have a typo, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a precision step.

Wait, the problem states that the precision is at 1e-4, so to four decimal places.

So perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

So beta =0.96.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Now, m0 c² is 5.6005668 GeV.

So E=3.571428571 *5.6005668.

Let me compute this precisely.

5.6005668 ×3.571428571.

Let me compute 5 ×3.571428571=17.857142855.

0.6005668 ×3.571428571.

Compute 0.6 ×3.571428571=2.1428571426.

0.0005668 ×3.571428571≈0.0020258.

So 0.6005668 ×3.571428571≈2.1428571426 +0.0020258=2.1448829426.

Adding to 17.857142855: 17.857142855 +2.1448829426=20.0020257976 GeV.

So E≈20.0020 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a lithium nucleus as 5.603 GeV/c².

Let me compute E=3.571428571 ×5.603.

3.571428571 ×5=17.857142855.

3.571428571 ×0.603=?

0.6 ×3.571428571=2.1428571426.

0.003 ×3.571428571=0.0107142857.

So 2.1428571426 +0.0107142857=2.1535714283.

Adding to 17.857142855: 17.857142855 +2.1535714283=20.010714283 GeV.

Still, that's about 20.01 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV. But why is there such a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different value for 1 amu, like 931.5 MeV/c².

Let me try that. m0=6.012456 amu ×931.5 MeV/amu.

6.012456 ×931.5.

6 ×931.5=5589.

0.012456 ×931.5=?

0.01 ×931.5=9.315.

0.002456 ×931.5= approximately 2.287.

So total 9.315 +2.287=11.602.

So m0 c²=5589 +11.602=5600.602 MeV=5.600602 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.600602.

5.600602 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.600602 ×3.57142857=?

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.000602 ×3.57142857=0.002154.

So total 2.142857142 +0.002154=2.145011142.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.145011142=20.00215399 GeV.

Hmm, still the same.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the nucleus as a point particle with a specific charge radius, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic energy with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula with the rest mass of the nucleus, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma factor.

Wait, another way to compute gamma:

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

No mistake here.

Hmm. I'm getting really stuck here. My calculation consistently gives around 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in a different way, like considering the mass of the atom instead of the nucleus. But that would give a higher energy.

Let me compute that. If I mistakenly used the atomic mass (including electrons) of Li-6 as 6.014102 amu, which is 6.014102 ×931.5 MeV=5600.6 MeV=5.6006 GeV.

E=3.5714 ×5.6006=20.002 GeV. Same result.

But if I used the atomic mass (including electrons), which is higher than the nucleus mass, then the energy would be higher.

Wait, no. Because the nucleus mass is less than the atomic mass. So using the atomic mass would give a higher E. Let me compute that.

If m0=6.014102 amu, then m0 c²=6.014102 *931.5 MeV=5600.6 MeV=5.6006 GeV.

E=3.5714 ×5.6006=20.002 GeV.

Same result as before. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass in a different way, like the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, sum of the individual nucleons: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

m_p=938.272 MeV, m_n=939.565 MeV.

So 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E=3.5714 ×5.633511 GeV.

3 ×5.633511=16.900533.

0.5714 ×5.633511=3.21107.

Total E=16.900533 +3.21107=20.1116 GeV.

That's closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Ah, perhaps that's the approach. The problem might be using the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without considering the binding energy) as the rest mass. So m0=5.6335 GeV.

Then E=3.5714 ×5.6335=20.111 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, neglecting the binding energy.

So the answer would be approximately 20.11 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV as option C.

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The steps are as follows:

---

### 1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))**
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

---

### 2. **Determine the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus (\( m_0 \))**
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the atomic mass of Li-6 (\( 6.014101918 \, \text{amu} \)) and subtracting the mass of 3 electrons (\( 3 \times 0.00054858 \, \text{amu} \)):

\[
m_{\text{nucleus}} = 6.014101918 - 3 \times 0.00054858 = 6.012456178 \, \text{amu}
\]

Converting to energy using \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.012456178 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5600.56 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6006 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### 3. **Calculate the total energy (\( E \))**
Using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

Substitute \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 \approx 5.6006 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6006 \approx 20.002 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### 4. **Reconcile with the options**
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.002 \, \text{GeV} \), but the closest option is \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \) (Option C). This discrepancy may arise from approximations in the rest mass calculation or differences in the assumed values for constants. If the problem assumes the sum of individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) without accounting for binding energy, the result aligns more closely with Option C.

\text{Answer: C}
