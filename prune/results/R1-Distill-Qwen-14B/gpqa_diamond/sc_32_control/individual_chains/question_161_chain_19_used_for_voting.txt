Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in a vacuum. Hmm, I remember that in electron microscopy, a vacuum is really important because if there's too much gas, the electrons get scattered and the image quality goes down. So Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get the sample compartment down to ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But even then, some gas particles are still there because the mass spectrometer detected them. 

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I think the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is the pressure. Right, so higher pressure means shorter mean free path because molecules are closer and collide more often.

But then Mike starts the electron beam, and he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, which is different from λ1. The question is why. The temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. The sample compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature were the same factors he used to determine λ1. Wait, but once the electron beam is on, does that change the conditions? 

Oh, I remember that high-energy electrons can cause various effects. One possibility is that the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize. So if the gas gets ionized, the ions would behave differently. But wait, in that case, the mean free path would probably increase because charged particles interact more with each other? Or maybe the electrons are being scattered by the gas molecules more, which would affect the electron beam but not necessarily the gas's mean free path. Hmm.

Wait another thought: The mean free path for the gas molecules themselves—like, how far they go before colliding with something—is that affected by the electron beam? I'm not so sure. The mean free path λ1 was determined based on vacuum factors. Once the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is being heated by the beam? Because high-energy electrons can deposit heat into the sample, but if the sample's temperature is the same, maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to ionize. Ionized gas increases the effective cross-section for collisions. Oh wait, because when a molecule is ionized, it has a charge, so maybe the ions attract each other more, changing how often they collide. Or perhaps the ions have a different mean free path because they're charged and interact differently with the chamber walls or other molecules.

But wait, when the mean free path is calculated, it's based on the average distance between collisions. If the gas becomes ionized, the ions might have a shorter mean free path because their effective diameter increases—due to the charge, they might be attracting or repelling each other, leading to more frequent collisions. Alternatively, perhaps the ions are easier to scatter because they have a charge, so they interact more with the electron beam, but that's about the electrons, not the gas molecules' movement.

Wait, another angle: The mean free path of the gas molecules is about how far they go without colliding. If the electron beam is causing some kind of interaction, like exciting the gas molecules, maybe this makes them move more, increasing the rate of collisions. Or perhaps the molecules are being knocked out of the chamber, reducing the pressure, which would increase the mean free path.

Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is ultra-high vacuum, so any change might be negligible. The pressure was already low. If the electron beam somehow increases the pressure, that would decrease the mean free path. But if it's a high-energy beam, could it cause gas molecules to be knocked out, effectively increasing the mean free path? Or maybe the presence of the beam doesn't affect the gas pressure, so the mean free path remains λ1.

Wait, but Mike's observation is that the mean free path changes. So the mean free path is now λ2, which is different. The question is whether λ2 is greater than or less than λ1.

Considering that the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So if the electron beam somehow reduces the pressure, that would increase λ. But wait, in ultra-high vacuum, how much would that affect? Or maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, and the ionized gas has a different behavior.

Wait, I think about the concept of mean free path in gases. The mean free path depends on the number of collisions. If the gas is ionized, the effective diameter increases because the ions have a larger effective size due to their charge. So the collision cross-section increases, so the mean free path decreases. Because if the cross-section is bigger, molecules collide more often, so the mean free path is smaller.

So if λ1 was calculated under neutral conditions, and λ2 is under ionized conditions, then λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C says λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think: In a vacuum, the mean free path is determined by the pressure. If the presence of the electron beam causes some gas to be removed (like pumping more effectively), the pressure would drop. Lower pressure means higher mean free path, so λ2 would be larger than λ1. But that's assuming that the beam somehow improves pumping, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, the electron beam may cause some gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which could cause them to stick to the walls or the sample, effectively removing them from the gas phase. That would lower the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. So in this case, λ2 would be larger than λ1. But that's a different scenario.

Wait, but in the problem statement, Mike detected gas particles with the mass spectrometer before initiating the beam. So the presence of gas is known. When he turns on the beam, perhaps the gas is being ionized, increasing the cross-section, which would cause more collisions, thus shorter mean free path. Or, the gas might be getting excited but not ionized, which might not change the cross-section.

Wait, the mean free path for gas molecules is about their movement and collisions. If the electron beam is causing them to ionize, the ions have a larger effective diameter because their charge increases the cross-section. So when calculating the mean free path, the collision cross-section σ would be σ = π (d + δ)^2, where δ is some factor due to charge. So σ increases, which makes λ = 1/(nσ) smaller. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: The mean free path for gas molecules is determined by the number density and the collision cross-section. If the cross-section increases (due to ionization), then the number of collisions increases, so the mean free path decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

So that would point to option C: λ2 < λ1.

Another angle: Why does the electron beam affect this? The electron beam could be causing the gas to be more rarified because the beam is heating the sample, which might cause more gas to be released or pumped out. But the problem states that the temperature remained the same, so it's not about thermal expansion or pressure changes due to temperature.

Wait, another possibility: The electron beam could cause gas molecules to be ionized, creating charged particles. These ions might be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, causing them to move towards the walls or electrodes. This could effectively remove them from the gas phase, thus lowering the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Hmm, this is conflicting. So which effect is more dominant? On one hand, ionization increases the cross-section, decreasing λ. On the other, ionized gas might be removed, lowering pressure and increasing λ.

Which effect wins? If the pressure is already ultra-low, any change due to ionization and removal might be minimal. But perhaps the ionization effect is more significant. Alternatively, maybe the dominant effect is the change in the nature of the gas.

Wait, but in electron microscopy, when you have a vacuum and turn on the electron beam, do the gas molecules get ionized or does the beam cause any movement of the gas? I'm not certain, but perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the mean free path because the gas molecules are being scattered by the electrons, thereby reducing their number in the compartment. Or perhaps the scattering of electrons by gas molecules causes the gas molecules to be knocked out of the chamber, effectively reducing the pressure.

Wait, that's a possibility. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be bombarded by electrons, causing them to gain energy or even be expelled from the chamber. If some gas is expelled, the pressure would decrease, so the mean free path would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, if the pressure decreases, λ = kT/(√2 π d² P). Since P decreases, λ increases. So in this case, λ2 would be greater than λ1. So λ2 > λ1. So looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. That's a big increase.

Option D: λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1. So a moderate increase.

But the question says that the temperature is the same, so T is the same. So the main change would be due to pressure.

If the pressure decreases, then λ increases. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

But wait, the initial pressure was already in the ultra-high vacuum. So even if the pressure decreases a bit, the mean free path would increase.

So the scenario is: before beam, λ1. After beam, λ2. Which is larger?

In that case, option C is λ2 < λ1, which would mean the mean free path is shorter. But in the scenario where pressure decreases, mean free path increases. So λ2>λ1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, Mike was trying to minimize gas, but some remained. Upon turning on the beam, he notices the mean free path is no longer λ1. If the beam is causing gas to leave, the mean free path would increase, which would help the electron microscopy by reducing scattering.

But the question is about what conclusion can be drawn about λ2. So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. Option D says between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Option C: λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities. So let me think again.

Mean free path equation: λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * n), where n is the number density. Alternatively, since pressure P = n*k*T, then λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n) = (P)/(√2 π d² n) * something. Wait, perhaps better to re-derive.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So n = P/(RT). Wait, or n = P/(kT), since n is number density (per unit volume). So,

n = P/(k T).

So the mean free path λ = 1/(√2 π d² n) = 1/(√2 π d² (P/(k T))) ) = (k T)/(√2 π d² P).

So λ is proportional to T/(P). 

If P decreases, λ increases.

So, the only way λ would change is if either P, T, or d changes. But in the problem, T is same, d is same (same gas molecules). So λ must change because P changes.

So, if the pressure drops, λ2 increases.

So λ2 > λ1.

So looking at options, which have λ2 greater than λ1.

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Option D: λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1.

But wait, why would λ2 be 1.22 times or more? Because what causes P to change?

Wait, when the electron beam is on, gas molecules may be ionized. The presence of ions can change the pressure if they are pumped out or if they stick to the walls more. Alternatively, the ionized gas could have a different behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas to be expelled, which would lower the pressure, thereby increasing λ.

But how significant is this effect? Since the initial pressure is already less than 1e-9 Torr, which is extremely low, any small change in pressure could have a big effect on the mean free path.

So if the pressure decreases by some factor, the mean free path increases by the inverse of that factor.

But, in the problem, Mike's observation is that the mean free path is now λ2. If the pressure decreases, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So, which option says λ2 is larger than λ1? Let's see.

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → λ2 bigger.

B) λ2=λ1 → no change.

C) λ2 < λ1 → no, opposite.

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1 → λ2 is bigger but less than 1.22 times.

So, which is it? Is λ2 larger than λ1, and by how much?

Wait, the relevant factor might be the factor of 1.22. Where does that number come from? Let me think. Oh, 1.22 is the factor for the Debye length or something else? Alternatively, perhaps it's the factor relating mean free path in different conditions.

Wait, maybe the factor 1.22 comes from the comparison between mean free path for elastic vs. inelastic collisions, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be ionized, which would increase their effective diameter, thereby decreasing the mean free path. But earlier reasoning suggested that if the pressure decreases (due to gas being removed), the mean free path increases.

Hmm, conflicting possibilities.

Wait, how else could the electron beam affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Another possibility: The presence of the electron beam may cause gas molecules to become excited (but not ionized), which could change their effective cross-section. However, if the gas is already in a high vacuum and the beam's energy is high, perhaps the dominant effect is that the gas is being pumped out more effectively, leading to a lower pressure and higher mean free path.

So, if the pressure decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the options don’t all have λ2>λ1. Let me look again.

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → implies a significant increase.

C) λ2 < λ1 → decrease.

So the question is, is the mean free path increasing or decreasing?

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, causing them to become ionized. Ionized gas would have a higher charge, which could cause them to interact more with the chamber walls or be pumped out more effectively. If the ionized gas is removed, the pressure decreases, so λ increases.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path may not change much if the pressure remains the same because the cross-section depends on the ion's diameter. But if the ions are being removed, the pressure goes down, so λ goes up.

So, this would lead to λ2 being larger than λ1.

So the answer would have λ2 > λ1. Now, looking at the options, options A and D suggest λ2 is larger.

But why would option A be 1.22 times and option D between λ1 and 1.22 times.

Wait, perhaps the factor 1.22 is due to an increase in the effective cross-section when considering ionization. Let's think.

The mean free path λ is 1/(n σ), where σ is the collision cross-section.

If the gas is neutral, σ is based on the molecular diameter d. When ionized, the effective diameter could increase. Because ions have a larger effective diameter due to their charge cloud. So σ increases, which would make λ decrease.

But wait, in that case, λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

So which effect is stronger: the possible decrease in pressure (causing λ to increase) or the increase in cross-section (causing λ to decrease)?

If the pressure decreases, it's a multiplicative effect on λ. Because λ is inversely proportional to pressure.

Suppose the pressure decreases by a factor of 1/0.833, then λ increases by 1.2 times. Because 1/0.833 is approximately 1.2.

Wait, 1.22 is approximately 1/(0.82), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the cross-section increases by a factor of sqrt(2), so the mean free path would decrease by sqrt(2), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The mean free path in the presence of charged particles (ions) would be affected by Coulomb interactions. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path is determined by the gas's ability to conduct electricity, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become a plasma, but at ultra-high vacuum, that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let's think about the situation: Before the beam, the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas particles are more likely to be ionized. If the gas is ionized, it's possible that the mean free path of the ions is different from the neutral gas.

Wait, but the question says that Mike observed a change in the mean free path of the gas molecules. So he's measuring the same gas's mean free path after the beam starts. So, the same gas is present, but now ionized.

In that case, the cross-section for collisions would be larger for ions than for neutral molecules because of their charge. So σ_ion > σ_neutral. So the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to σ, so λ_ion = λ_neutral * (σ_neutral / σ_ion) < λ_neutral.

So λ2 would be less than λ1. So the answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

But wait, this contradicts the earlier thought that the pressure might decrease, leading to a longer mean free path. But in this case, the gas is still there; Mike just changed the beam on. So pressure remains the same? If the pressure is same, but the cross-section increases due to ionization, λ would decrease.

But wait, if the gas is ionized, but the pressure is the same, then λ would drop.

So in that case, option C is correct.

But wait, another possibility: When the gas is ionized, the actual number density might change. For example, if ionization causes the gas to dissociate or combine, but I think that's less likely under high vacuum.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, it might be pumped away more efficiently because charged particles are more likely to be captured by the chamber walls or the pump. So the pressure could decrease, leading to an increase in λ.

Hmm, but the problem states that the temperature remained the same. So thermal effects are not the cause. If the pressure drops, λ increases.

But the question is, is the pressure dropping because the gas is being pumped out more, or is the gas's cross-section increasing?

I think I'm stuck between two possibilities.

Wait, what's the practical effect of turning on the electron beam in a TEM? I remember that in TEMs, the vacuum is maintained by pumps, but the electron beam can cause some gas to be knocked out of the sample or the chamber, but in ultra-high vacuum, this effect is minimal. However, the gas molecules in the chamber are likely to be at such a low pressure that their mean free path is already very long. But when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be scattered or ionized, which affects the electron beam's resolution. However, the problem is about the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas's mean free path, but Mike observed a change in how the electrons scatter, which is related to the gas's presence. But the question is about the gas's mean free path, not the electron's scattering.

Hmm, perhaps the mean free path of the gas increases when the beam is on because the gas is being more effectively removed, but it's possible that the beam causes some gas molecules to be ionized, which then stick to the walls more, effectively removing them. So again, the pressure decreases, leading to a longer mean free path.

But if that's the case, λ2 > λ1, which would make option A or D correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path doesn't change because the pressure is so low, and the beam's effect is negligible. But the problem states that there's a change, so that's not the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to approach it from the given options.

If the correct answer is option C, λ2 < λ1, that suggests that the mean free path is shorter when the beam is on. That could happen if the cross-section increases (e.g., due to ionization), assuming pressure remains the same.

If the correct answer is option A or D, that suggests λ2 is longer than λ1.

But how to decide?

Wait, considering that the presence of the electron beam would provide energy to the gas molecules. If the gas is ionized, ions have higher mass, but the mean free path depends on collisions. Alternatively, the ions could move faster, but in the mean free path equation, temperature is same, so speed isn't the main factor.

Wait, no. The mean free path formula uses the temperature, but if the gas is ionized, the effective temperature might change. But the problem says the temperature of the sample compartment remains the same.

Another thought: The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the gas is ionized, the ion's mean free path would be shorter because they might interact more with each other or the walls, but if the pressure is same, same applies.

Alternatively, since the electron beam is moving at high speed, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded and scattered more, leading to more frequent collisions. But that would affect the electron's path, not directly the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas's mean free path isn't directly affected, but Mike's measurement was based on electron scattering, which is affected by the gas density.

Wait, the problem says Mike accurately determined the mean free path as λ1 before the beam. Then, upon initiating the beam, he found that the mean free path was λ2. So the change is due to the electron beam's presence, probably affecting the gas in some way.

Wait, but how does the electron beam affect the gas? It could cause gas molecules to be ionized. Ionized gas might have a lower mean free path because the cross-section is larger. So λ2 < λ1.

So that would make option C correct.

But earlier, the reasoning about pressure was conflicting. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the gas doesn't change because the pressure and temperature are the same, but Mike's observation was about the electron beam's mean free path. But the question is about the gas's mean free path.

Wait, the question says, he found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1. So the gas's mean free path changed. So either due to the environment changing (like pressure) or the gas's properties (like ionization).

But if the pressure remains the same, and the gas is ionized, the cross-section would be larger, so λ decreases.

So the answer is option C: λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


In the given scenario, Mike is operating a high-resolution transmission electron microscope under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10⁻⁹ Torr). Initially, he determines the mean free path of the gas molecules in the vacuum as λ₁. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observes that the mean free path changes to λ₂. The question asks whether λ₂ is greater than, less than, or equal to λ₁.

The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules is determined by the equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(P\) is the pressure. Since the temperature (\(T\)) remains constant, any change in λ must arise from changes in the pressure (\(P\)) or the effective collision cross-section (\(d^2\)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Effect of the Electron Beam on Gas Molecules**:
   - The electron beam can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective collision cross-section due to the charged nature of the ions, which leads to more frequent collisions between gas molecules. This would decrease the mean free path (\(λ\)).

2. **Pressure Changes**:
   - While the electron beam might cause some gas molecules to be removed (e.g., through ionization or interaction with the walls), the problem specifies that the temperature remains constant, and the initial pressure is already extremely low. Thus, the pressure change is unlikely to be significant enough to alter the mean free path by a large factor.

3. **Dominant Effect**:
   - The ionization of gas molecules increases their effective cross-section, which has a more direct and significant impact on reducing the mean free path compared to any potential pressure changes. Therefore, the dominant effect is the increase in the collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path (\(λ₂ < λ₁\)).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\(λ₂ \geq 1.22 \cdot λ₁\))**: This implies a significant increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the ionization effect that reduces the mean free path.
- **Option B (\(λ₂ = λ₁\))**: This suggests no change in the mean free path, which contradicts Mike's observation of a change.
- **Option C (\(λ₂ < λ₁\))**: This aligns with the reasoning that ionization increases the collision cross-section, reducing the mean free path.
- **Option D (\(λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 \cdot λ₁\))**: This implies a moderate increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the ionization effect.

### Conclusion:
The ionization of gas molecules by the electron beam increases their effective collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that \(λ₂ < λ₁\).
