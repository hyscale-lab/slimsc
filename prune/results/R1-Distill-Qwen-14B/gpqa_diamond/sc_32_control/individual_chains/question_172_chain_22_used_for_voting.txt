Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of a star that emits light, right? And it's about the energy levels of the iron atoms there.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh, I think it's referring to the excitation state, like the number of atoms in that energy level. So maybe the population of that energy level is higher in star_1.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, because that's probably the delta E or the energy quantum between the levels.

And the question says to assume that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means each small region of the photosphere behaves like a blackbody at a certain temperature. So we can apply the Boltzmann distribution here.

So the key idea here is the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of the populations of two energy states is given by exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So let me write that down. The Boltzmann distribution for two states is:

n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, in the problem, the higher level is more excited, so E2 is higher than E1. The question says that star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is given.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think it's the ratio of the population of a specific higher energy level to the lower one. Let's say for each star, the ratio is n_high/n_low. For star_1, that ratio is twice what it is for star_2.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, that phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that the excitation (the energy) is twice as high, or that the number of excited atoms is twice as much?

Wait, no, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy levels differ by that amount. So the excitation energy is fixed, but the number of atoms in that excited state is different in the two stars.

I think the correct interpretation is that the number of excited atoms in that specific level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So the ratio of populations for each star is (n_high/n_low) = something, and for star_1, that ratio is twice that of star_2.

So for star_1, (n_high)^1 / (n_low)^1 = 2 * [ (n_high)^2 / (n_low)^2 ]

But wait, no, because star_2 has a lower ratio. Let me think. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1, and for star_2 as R2. So according to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, no, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Maybe it's that the excitation (the population) is twice as high, so the ratio R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the number of atoms in the higher level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, n_high = 2 * n_high_star2. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me read again.

Wait, the problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level (the population in that level) is twice as much in star_1. So, n_high for star_1 is twice that of star_2. But wait, no, because the stars themselves might have different temperatures, so the populations will be different.

Wait, but the question is about the effective temperatures. So we're to relate T1 and T2 based on the excitation levels.

So to model this, for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_high) to the ground state (n_low) is given by the Boltzmann factor:

n_high / n_low = exp( - ΔE / (k T) )

But wait, ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Since it's the same for both stars, ΔE is the same. So for each star, the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, the excitation in star_1 is twice as much compared to star_2. Hmm, I'm not exactly clear on what that means. Is R1 equal to 2 R2, or is n_high for star_1 equal to twice that of star_2?

Wait, perhaps the ratio n_high/n_low is given. So for star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, let's think. Let's say for star_2, the ratio is R2, and for star_1, it's R1 = 2 R2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) and R2 is exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2 )

Bring the terms involving T to one side:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] = - ln(2 )

Hmm, that's:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) = - ln(2 )

Wait, because 1/T1 - 1/T2 is (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2).

So then,

ΔE/(k) * ( (T2 - T1) ) / (T1 T2) ) = - ln(2 )

We can rearrange that:

(T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) = [ - ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But I don't know the exact values of k and ΔE, but perhaps the equation can be simplified.

Wait, the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is approximately k. Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So assuming ΔE = k, then:

(T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = [ - ln(2) * k ] / (k ) ) = - ln(2 )

So,

(T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = - ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is exactly what this equation is.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, the initial equation after taking the ln was:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-do that step.

We have R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Then,

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2 )

Which can be written as ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But if ΔE = k, then,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) * k / k = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rearranged as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, but option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the two stars.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = -\ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \) as \( \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
