Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh, right, tau is related to the width Γ. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, actually, more accurately, the width Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime is tau = ħ/(Γ). But since Γ is given in GeV units, I have to handle the units properly.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma: gamma = E / (m c^2). But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E is the total energy? So gamma should be E / (m c^2), but since E is already in GeV and m is in GeV/c², I think the units for gamma would be E/(m) because E = gamma m c². So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Wait, let me confirm. The energy E is the total energy of the meson, so E = gamma m c². Therefore, gamma = E/(m c²). But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², the c² will cancel out when considering units. So gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) * (c^2 / c^2) ) Hmm, actually, perhaps it's just 8 / 1.2, because the units GeV and GeV/c² will have c² in the denominator. So yes, gamma is 8 / 1.2, which is 6.666... or 20/3.

2. Calculate beta. Beta is v/c, and since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), we can rearrange to find beta. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))). Alternatively, beta can be approximated for high gamma as approximately 1, but given that gamma is 6.666, which is not extremely large, I'll calculate it properly.

So gamma = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Gamma squared: (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - 9/400 = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887. Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, 0.988^2 is approximately 0.976, and 0.9887 squared is about 0.9775. So yes, beta is approximately 0.9887.

3. Compute tau, the proper lifetime. Tau is hbar / Gamma. Wait, but the width is given in MeV. So Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, units: hbar is Planck's constant over 2pi, which is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = hbar / Gamma. So hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let's calculate that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 = let's see... 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s.

So tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is the same as 2.056875e-24 s.

4. Now, the mean lifetime is tau. But the particle is moving, so the lifetime observed is gamma * tau. So the lifetime from the lab frame is gamma multiplied by tau.

Wait no, wait. The decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Because in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau, so the distance it travels is beta c tau. But in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the particle, time dilation applies, so the lifetime is gamma tau, so the distance would be beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

So putting it all together:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

We have gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6667, beta ≈0.9887, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s, tau= ~2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute gamma * beta: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's see, 6.6667 * 0.9887. 6 * 0.98 is 5.88, 0.6667 *0.9887 is about 0.658, so total approx 6.538. Alternatively, more accurately: 6.6667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute 0.6667 * 0.98 = approx 0.6534, and 0.6667 * 0.0087 ≈ 0.0058. So total 0.6534 + 0.0058 = 0.6592.

So 5.9322 + 0.6592 = 6.5914.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5914.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So multiplying all together:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau

= 6.5914 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s)

Let me compute the numbers:

First, multiply 3e8 m/s and 2.056875e-24 s.

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625.

1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.170625e-16 meters.

Now multiply this by gamma * beta ≈6.5914.

So 6.5914 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Hmm, 6.5914 * 6.170625.

Let me compute that.

6 * 6 =36, but more precisely:

6.5914 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6.5914 *6 =39.5484.

6.5914 *0.170625 ≈0.5599.

So total ≈39.5484 + 0.5599 ≈40.1083.

So 40.1083e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, 6.5914 *6.170625e-16.

Wait, 6.5914 *6.170625 = 40.1083 approximately. So 40.1083e-16 m.

Which is 4.01083e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, option C is 5.0223e-15, etc.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 4.01e-15, but the closest option is B (4.0655e-15). But perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, let's recompute gamma * beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/(400/9)) ) = sqrt( (400 -9)/400 ) = sqrt(391/400) ) = sqrt(0.9775).

sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

But perhaps I can compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 0.9775.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) to more decimal places.

0.9887^2 = 0.97752569, which is very close to 0.9775.

So beta is ~0.9887.

So gamma * beta = 6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute this more accurately.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887:

Compute 0.6 * 0.9887 = 0.59322.

0.0666667 *0.9887 ≈0.06589.

So 0.59322 + 0.06589 ≈ 0.65911.

So total gamma beta is 5.9322 + 0.65911 = 6.59131.

So 6.59131.

Now, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma beta: 6.59131 * 6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.59131 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6.59131 *6.170625.

Break it down:

6 * 6 =36.

6 *0.170625 =1.02375.

0.59131 *6 =3.54786.

0.59131 *0.170625 ≈0.1009.

Add all together:

36 + 1.02375 =37.02375.

37.02375 +3.54786=40.57161.

40.57161 +0.1009=40.6725.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should compute 6.59131 * 6.170625 more accurately.

Wait, 6.59131 multiplied by 6.170625.

= (6 + 0.59131) * (6 + 0.170625)

=6*6 + 6*0.170625 + 0.59131*6 + 0.59131*0.170625.

=36 + 1.02375 + 3.54786 + (approx 0.1009).

36 +1.02375=37.02375.

37.02375 +3.54786=40.57161.

40.57161 +0.1009=40.67251.

So 6.59131 *6.170625 ≈40.6725.

So 40.6725e-16 meters.

Which is 4.06725e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why is my initial approximate calculation giving a slightly higher value? Let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the width is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Another possible mistake: Did I confuse GeV and MeV? No, because I converted Gamma to GeV (320 MeV = 0.32 GeV).

Also, c is 3e8 m/s, correct.

So calculation seems correct, leading to approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m). The slight discrepancy is due to more precise calculations, but it's very close.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

Rearranging for \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma_X \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]

Here, \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
Substitute \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5913
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \times 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
