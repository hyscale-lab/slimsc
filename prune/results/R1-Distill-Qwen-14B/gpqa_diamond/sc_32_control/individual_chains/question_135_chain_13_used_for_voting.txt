Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λ_f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, wait, I think that's a typo in my notes. Oh, I see, it's probably L(y) = -λ_f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this is a Yukawa interaction term, right? Because Yukawa interactions are like that, coupling a scalar (or boson) to fermions with a coupling constant λ.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. And the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find which fermion pairs X can decay into.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy to be created. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because when a particle decays, each product must have rest mass energy, and the kinetic energy must be non-negative, so the sum of the rest masses must be ≤ the mass of the parent.

So, X can decay into a pair of fermions ff̄ if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

What fermions are available? Let's list all possible charged leptons and quarks.

Charged leptons: electrons (e), muons (μ), taus (τ). Their masses are approximately:

e: 0.511 MeV
μ: 105.7 MeV
τ: 1777 MeV (about 1.777 GeV)
Wait, the tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 1.777 * 2 = ~3.55 GeV. So X is 6 GeV, which is more than that. So tau pairs are allowed.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV is greater than 2*(mass of tau), which is about 3.55 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Similarly, for electrons, 2m_e is about 1 MeV, way below 6 GeV. Same for muons: 2m_mu is about 0.21 GeV, much less than 6 GeV.

So X can decay into e+ e- and μ+ μ- and tau+ tau-.

Now for quarks: X can decay into quark-antiquark pairs. But which quarks are light enough? The quark masses vary, but in the Standard Model, the masses are:

up (u): about 2.2 MeV
down (d): about 4.7 MeV
strange (s): about 95 MeV
charm (c): about 1.5 GeV
bottom (b): about 4.7 GeV
top (t): about 173 GeV

So, the masses of the quarks. For X to decay into a quark pair, 2m_q must be ≤6 GeV.

Looking at each quark:

u: 2m_u = 4.4 MeV → allowed
d: 2m_d = 9.4 MeV → allowed
s: 2m_s ≈ 190 MeV → allowed
c: 2m_c ≈ 3 GeV → allowed (since 3 <6)
b: 2m_b ≈ 9.4 GeV → 9.4 is greater than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Top quark is way too heavy; 2m_t is like 346 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV.

So X can decay into u, d, s, c quarks, but not b or t.

Wait, but wait. Do I need to consider whether the fermion is accessible via the interaction? Because the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which presumably are the fermion fields. So which fermions are coupled to X?

Looking at the Lagrangian: the interaction term is -λ_f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So the fermion ψ_f is interacting with X. So ψ_f could be any fermion that has a Yukawa coupling to X.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs field (which is a boson) couples to all fermions. But in this problem, the interaction is given as for ψ_f. So unless specified otherwise, does X couple to all fermions, or only some?

Wait, the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So ψ_f refers to the fermion species that X interacts with. So the Lagrangian term implies that X couples to ψ_f, which presumably are specific fermions.

But in the multiple-choice options, the possible decay channels include various quarks and leptons. So I think the assumption is that X can decay into any fermion pair as long as the mass allows it, provided that X couples to those fermions.

Wait, but maybe the problem is in the context of the Standard Model, where the Higgs field couples to different fermions with different couplings. So X in this problem would behave similarly to the Higgs boson, so it can decay into any fermion pair for which 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So in that case, X can decay into any fermion pair where 2m_f is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So the fermions allowed are:

Leptons: e, μ, τ (since 2m_τ ≈3.55 GeV <=6 GeV)
Quarks: u, d, s, c (since 2m_c is ~3 GeV <=6 GeV; 2m_b is ~9.4 GeV >6, so no b; t is way too heavy).

So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−, uū, dđ, ŝ s̄, cī.

Wait, but what about the charges? Because X is neutral, assuming it's a scalar like the Higgs. So when it decays, it must produce a fermion-antifermion pair, which would have charges that sum to zero. So for example, a pair of electrons (with charges -1 and +1) sum to zero. Same for quarks—each quark has charge +2/3 or -1/3, so a quark and antiquark would cancel.

So the possible decay products are all the pairs where m_f is such that 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So:

For leptons: e, μ, τ.

For quarks: u, d, s, c.

So X can decay into:

e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−, uū, dđ, ŝ s̄, cī.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄,... which isn't allowed because 2m_b is 9.4 GeV>6 GeV. So A is out.

Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. So that's all except for b and t. So B includes all except b and t. But does it include all the right fermions?

Looking at option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−. That seems correct.

Option C: includes t t̄ which is 2m_t=346 GeV>6 GeV, so C is out.

Option D: includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So D is out.

So the correct option should be B.

Wait, but looking again, the options:

Option A: includes b, which is too heavy.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The kinematic condition for a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) is \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). Additionally, \( X \) must couple to the fermions involved in the decay.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses and Decays:
1. **Charged Leptons**:
   - \( e^+e^- \): \( 2m_e \approx 1 \, \text{MeV} \), which is much less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( \mu^+\mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( \tau^+\tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.

2. **Quarks**:
   - \( u\bar{u} \): \( 2m_u \approx 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( d\bar{d} \): \( 2m_d \approx 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( s\bar{s} \): \( 2m_s \approx 190 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( c\bar{c} \): \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
   - \( b\bar{b} \): \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \), which is greater than 6 GeV. Not allowed.
   - \( t\bar{t} \): \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which is much greater than 6 GeV. Not allowed.

3. **Exclusion of \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \)**:
   - The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are too heavy for \( X \) to decay into their pairs, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are \( X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), as given in **Option B**.
