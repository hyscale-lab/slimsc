Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The question is asking which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D, with different exponents on 10.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, which is ħ. So ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2.

Wait, the lifetimes of the states are given. I think the lifetime is related to the uncertainty in time here. So each state has its own lifetime, which would be the Δt for each. But wait, in this case, we're looking at two different states and their energy difference. Or maybe the lifetime relates to the measurement time of their energy?

Wait, no. Let me think. Each state has a certain lifetime, which is the time it exists before decaying. So for a quantum state, the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in energy. Because the longer the lifetime, the more precisely we can know the energy, since the state doesn't change quickly. So the relation is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

Wait, so for each state, the uncertainty in energy is about ħ divided by the lifetime. But wait, in this problem, we're considering two different states. So each has their own uncertainties, but I'm not sure how that directly applies here.

Wait, maybe it's more about being able to resolve two different energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the combined uncertainty of the measurements, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the energy resolution required to distinguish the two levels. The energy difference (ΔE = E2 - E1) must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So the uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the uncertainties in each energy? Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty comes from the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty in energy.

Let me get this straight. The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE_i ≈ ħ / τ_i. So for the first state, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9). The second state has τ2 = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8). 

Wait, but ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. So let me compute these.

Wait, but the options are in eV, so maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.05e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) = approximately 6.56e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So for the first state, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.

Hmm, that's 6.58e-7 eV. For the second state, τ2 = 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 ≈ (6.58e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainties are 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for the two states. So the combined uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of these two? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Because if you're trying to measure the difference between E2 and E1, the uncertainty in ΔE would be ΔE2 + ΔE1, assuming the errors are independent.

Wait, but the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties so that they can be resolved. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2. 

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. Adding them together: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8 eV.

Hmm, none of the options are around 1e-7 eV. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy difference in terms of the time it takes to measure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the uncertainty in the energy due to the lifetime of each state. So the energy is uncertain by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ for each. So to resolve two energies, E2 and E1, their separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.

So the energy difference must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Which, as computed above, is about 7.24e-7 eV.

But the options are all much smaller than that. The closest is option C) 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV, much larger than 7e-7 eV. Option A is 1e-9, which is much smaller.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the ħ value.

Wait, another approach: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

In eV·s, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so ħ ≈ (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) ) = approx 6.59e-16 eV·s.

So yes, that's correct.

So for τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 = 6.59e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.59e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2=1e-8 s, ΔE2 = 6.59e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.59e-8 eV.

So the sum is ~7.25e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than this to be resolved.

Looking at the options, none are larger than this. The largest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger. So that should be the correct answer?

Wait, but why is the option D 1e-8 eV? That's the same as the ΔE2.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently. Perhaps the question is about the energy resolution of a measurement. The energy resolution is often given by ΔE = ħ / τ. So if you have a measurement with a time duration τ, the uncertainty is ħ/τ.

But in this case, perhaps the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the maximum of their individual uncertainties.

Wait, because if the energy difference is larger than either of the individual uncertainties, you can possibly distinguish them. Let me think. If two peaks are separated by more than the width of the lines, you can see them as separate. So perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties.

In this case, ΔE1 (6.58e-7) is larger than ΔE2 (6.58e-8). So to distinguish E1 and E2, the ΔE between them must be larger than ΔE1.

Because if the difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty, then you can resolve them.

So the required ΔE should be greater than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is much larger than 6.58e-7. So that would satisfy the condition.

But wait, what if the measurement's time is limited? Hmm, perhaps the measurement time is given by the longer lifetime? Or perhaps each state's lifetime gives its own energy uncertainty. So if the energy difference is greater than either of the individual uncertainties, then the two can be resolved.

So the minimal required ΔE is the maximum of the two uncertainties. If ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2), then they can be resolved.

So in this case, since ΔE1 is larger, the energy difference must be larger than ΔE1, which is 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the only one larger than this (even just barely) is option C (1e-4 eV), which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. But 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658 eV. So 1e-4 is 1000 times larger.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but why is option D) 1e-8 eV. That's the same as the ΔE2. So if the energy difference is 1e-8, which is less than ΔE1, then you can't distinguish them.

So the answer should be option C, 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, the lifetimes of the two states (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)) represent the uncertainties in time (\( \Delta t \)). The energy uncertainty for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_i \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_i}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \)) must be greater than the combined uncertainty in energy, which is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Among the given options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small, as it is much less than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small for the same reason.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: Sufficiently large, as it is much greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small, as it is less than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**.
