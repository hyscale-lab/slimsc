Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves an operator P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is represented as a matrix. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z.

Hmm. So, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Right, so I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. But wait, since P_z is a Hermitian operator, its expectation value is real, and for ⟨P_z²⟩, since it's just the operator squared, it's the same as the expectation of P_z squared.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the basis. The problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state provided is given in the P_z basis. That should make things easier because I can directly compute the expectation values.

Wait, no. Wait, the state is given as a column vector, but in which basis? Because the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state vector's components are the coefficients in the P_z eigenbasis. So, the state |ψ⟩ is represented by the vector ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. So each component corresponds to a different eigenstate of P_z.

So, for P_z, since the basis is its eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal. Let me look at P_z's matrix. Oh, yes, P_z's matrix is diagonal: [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ, with corresponding eigenvectors being the basis vectors.

So, when the state is given as a vector in this basis, the expectation value of P_z is simply the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, the state has components a, b, c, where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2. Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector with components in the basis. So the square of the absolute value of each component gives the probability.

Wait, but here, the components are real numbers, but do they represent amplitudes or probabilities? No, they are the amplitude coefficients. So the probability for each eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient.

So, let's compute |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2.

a = -1/2 → |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

b = 1/√2 → |b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

c = -1/2 → |c|^2 = 1/4.

So the probabilities are 25%, 50%, and 25% for the three eigenstates of P_z, which have eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) 

Calculating that: (1/4 - 1/4) ħ → 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Hmm, interesting.

Then, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since for each eigenstate, the square of the eigenvalue is (ħ)^2, 0^2=0, and (-ħ)^2=ħ^2. So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the variance, which is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩², is (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = ħ²/2.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance: sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option B is ħ/√2.

So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recheck.

The state is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. So each component is the amplitude for the eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

The probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|².

a is -1/2, so |a|² is 1/4.

b is 1/√2, so |b|² is 1/2.

c is -1/2, |c|² is 1/4.

So, the expectation of P_z is (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

The expectation of P_z squared: (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So variance is 1/2 ħ², so uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Yes, that seems right. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. The probabilities are given by the squared magnitudes of the components of $| \psi \rangle$:

- $|a|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$ for the eigenvalue $\hbar$,
- $|b|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$ for the eigenvalue $0$,
- $|c|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$ for the eigenvalue $-\hbar$.

Thus, 

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (1/4)(\hbar) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ corresponds to the square of the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Therefore, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4)(\hbar^2) + (1/2)(0^2) + (1/4)((-\hbar)^2) = (1/4 + 1/4)\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is given by:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
