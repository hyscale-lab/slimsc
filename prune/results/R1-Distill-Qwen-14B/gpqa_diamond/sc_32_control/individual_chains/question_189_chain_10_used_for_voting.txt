Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about particles and broken symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question is asking which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking happens when the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry. So, particles arising from such a broken symmetry are called 'Nambu-Goldstone bosons' I think. They have a lower mass because the symmetry is broken.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Phonon. Phonons are quantized sound waves in a solid. I think they come from the vibrations of atoms in a crystal lattice. When a crystal has a certain symmetry, like in a perfect lattice, but when it's in a lower energy state, maybe when it's broken into a different phase, phonons emerge. So phonons are Nambu-Goldstone bosons, hence associated with broken symmetry. So A is associated with SSB.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were originally proposed in the context of nuclear physics to describe nucleons. But I think they also appear in other areas, like in magnetic materials. Skyrmions arise due to the breaking of certain symmetries. For example, in the context of pion masses, the pion is a Goldstone boson when chiral symmetry is broken. Wait, but Skyrmions are more about the structureâ€”like, they're solutions in a theory with certain symmetries. But wait, does the Skyrmion itself come from a broken symmetry? Or is it an object that exists in a theory where symmetry is broken? Hmm, maybe Skyrmions are not Goldstone bosons. Or wait, maybe they are solutions in a theory with symmetry breaking. I'm a bit confused here.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in a crystal. They arise from the quantization of spin waves. In ferromagnetic materials, the system has a broken symmetry because it chooses a magnetization direction. The spin waves (magnons) are the Goldstone bosons for that broken rotational symmetry. So C is associated with SSB.

Option D: Pion. Pions are the lightest hadrons, and I remember that in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the pions are the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. So D is definitely associated with SSB.

So the question is which one is NOT associated. So I need to find the one that isn't a Goldstone boson.

Phonon (A) is a Goldstone boson in crystals with broken translational symmetry. So that's correct.

Skyrmion (B): Wait, Skyrmions are a bit different. They are not Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions are solutions of the equations of motion in a theory where symmetry is broken. For instance, in the case of pion physics, the Skyrmion model treats the pions as the Goldstone bosons, but the Skyrmion itself is a soliton. So Skyrmions are related to symmetry breaking, but are they the result of it? Or do they arise in a theory where symmetry is broken? Hmm.

Wait, when chiral symmetry is broken, pions are the Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions are a different concept. They arise in a theory where chiral symmetry is broken but also have some other structure. So maybe Skyrmions are not the Goldstone bosons themselves but are solutions that exist because of the symmetry breaking. So in that case, the Skyrmion is associated with the broken symmetry, but it's not a Goldstone boson. But the question is about whether the particle is associated with a broken symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about the particle not being associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So if Skyrmions are a result of symmetry breaking, then they are associated with it. But if they are not, then they're the answer.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each particle represents.

Goldstone's theorem says that when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, massless bosons (Goldstone bosons) appear. For phonons, when a crystal breaks translational symmetry (like when it's in a disordered phase), phonons emerge as Goldstone bosons.

Magnons are similar in that they arise from the broken rotational symmetry in a magnetic material. So they are Goldstone bosons too.

Pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.

Skyrmions, though, are not Goldstone bosons. They are topological solitons, meaning their existence is due to the topology of the vacuum in the theory. They arise in theories where there's a broken symmetry, but they aren't the Goldstone bosons themselves. So perhaps Skyrmions are not the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same way. Wait, but I'm not too sure. Another angle: in the context of broken symmetry, Goldstone bosons appear as massless or light particles. Skyrmions are not necessarily massless and are more about the structure of the theory. So maybe the Skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson, so it's not associated with a broken symmetry in the same way.

Wait, but the question is about which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So if Skyrmions are a result of SSB, then B is associated. So if the other options are, then the odd one out is... I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall what each one is. Phonon is a Goldstone of translation symmetry breaking in crystals. Magnon is a Goldstone of broken rotational symmetry in magnets. Pion is a Goldstone of chiral symmetry breaking. So all of these (A, C, D) are Goldstone bosons. What about Skyrmion?

Wait, another thought: Skyrmion is a soliton, not a Goldstone boson. So Skyrmions are solutions in a theory with symmetry breaking but are not the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Therefore, the Skyrmion is not the Goldstone boson particle, so it's not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in that way.

So the question is about which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. So among the options, Skyrmion (B) might be the answer. Or wait, no, because Skyrmions arise in a theory with symmetry breaking. So they are associated with it, but they are not the Goldstone bosons themselves.

Wait, the question is about which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So if the others (A, C, D) are Goldstone bosons, and B is not, then B is the correct answer.

So the answer would be B) Skyrmion.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each option:

- **Option A: Phonon**  
  Phonons are quantized vibrational modes in a crystal lattice. They arise as Nambu-Goldstone bosons when translational symmetry is spontaneously broken in a crystalline solid. Thus, phonons are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

- **Option B: Skyrmion**  
  Skyrmions are topological solitons that arise in certain theories, such as those involving chiral symmetry breaking. However, they are not Nambu-Goldstone bosons themselves. Instead, they are solutions to the equations of motion in a theory with broken symmetry. While they are related to symmetry breaking, they are not directly the result of it in the same way as Goldstone bosons. Therefore, Skyrmions are not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same sense as the other particles.

- **Option C: Magnon**  
  Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin waves in magnetic materials. They emerge as Nambu-Goldstone bosons when rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken in a magnetic system. Thus, magnons are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

- **Option D: Pion**  
  Pions are the lightest hadrons and act as the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Therefore, pions are associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

From this analysis, phonons, magnons, and pions are all Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries. Skyrmions, while related to symmetry breaking, are not Nambu-Goldstone bosons and are not directly associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
