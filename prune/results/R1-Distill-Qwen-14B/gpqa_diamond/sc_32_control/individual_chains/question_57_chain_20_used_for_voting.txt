Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that deals with the conservation of kinetic energy, right? But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, scattering amplitude relates to how particles are scattered, and phase shifts are involved here.

The given phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. The rest are ignored, so I only consider these. I think the formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part involves a sum over these phase shifts. Let me try to recall.

In partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given in terms of Legendre polynomials and phase shifts. The imaginary part of f(0), the scattering amplitude along the beam direction (θ=0), is given by the sum over all l of ( (2l + 1)/(4π) ) * sin(δ_l). Wait, yes, because the real and imaginary parts come from the phase shifts. So for each l, the term is ( (2l+1) / (4π) ) * sin(δ_l), and the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of these terms for all l.

Wait, but what's l here? The phase shifts δ_l correspond to different angular momenta. So for example, δ₀ is the s-wave (l=0), δ₁ is p-wave (l=1), δ₂ is d-wave (l=2), and so on.

So the imaginary part Im f(0) is (1/(4π)) [ sin δ₀ + 3 sin δ₁ + 5 sin δ₂ + 7 sin δ₃ + 9 sin δ₄ + ... ]. Since higher l's are ignored beyond δ₄, we can stop at δ₄.

Let's plug in the values:

Compute each term:
sin δ₀ = sin 90° = 1 → (2*0 +1)=1 → term is 1*1/(4π) → 1/(4π)
sin δ₁ = sin 67°. Let me calculate that. 67 degrees... sin(60)=√3/2≈0.866, sin(75)≈0.966. 67 is between, so approx 0.9205. So 3 * 0.9205 = 2.7615 → term is 2.7615/(4π)
Similarly, sin δ₂ = sin(55°). 55 degrees is about 0.8192. So 5 * 0.8192 =4.096 → term is 4.096/(4π)
Sin δ₃ = sin(30°)=0.5 → 7 *0.5=3.5 → term is 3.5/(4π)
Sin δ₄ = sin(13°). 13° is approximately 0.22495. So 9 * 0.22495≈2.0245 → term is 2.0245/(4π)

Now sum all these terms:

Term0: (1)/(4π)
Term1: (2.7615)/(4π)
Term2: (4.096)/(4π)
Term3: (3.5)/(4π)
Term4: (2.0245)/(4π)

Sum = (1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 +3.5 +2.0245)/(4π). Let me add these numerators.

1 + 2.7615 =3.7615

3.7615 +4.096 =7.8575

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575

11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

So sum is 13.382/(4π)

Wait, 4π is approximately 12.566. Let me compute 13.382 / 12.566 ≈ 1.064.

Wait, but wait, the formula is Im f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (4π). So the sum we computed is 13.382/(4π) → 4π is about 12.566, so 13.382 /12.566 ≈ 1.064. Wait, but 13.382 ≈ 4π is 12.566, so 13.382 is about 1.064 times 4π? Hmm, no, wait, 13.382 over 4π is 13.382 / (12.566) ≈ 1.064.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives the phase shifts, and we need to compute the imaginary part in fm. Because scattering amplitude is in units of length (fm, femtometers), since the formula has (2l+1)/(4π) times sinδ, I think. Wait, but I'm getting a value of approximately 1.064, but that's in 1/(4π) which is 1/(~12.566). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait. The formula is Im f(θ=0) = [sum (2l +1) sin δ_l ] / (4π). So the sum is 13.382, and divided by 4π. So 13.382 / (4π) ≈ 13.382 / 12.566 ≈ 1.064. So Im f(0) is approximately 1.064.

Wait, but the options are in units of fm. So perhaps the formula gives Im f in units of 1/(fm), or maybe I've missed something about the energy dependence. Because I remember that the scattering amplitude f is proportional to something involving the wavelength, and maybe the energy.

Wait, the electrons have energy 50 MeV. So perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (something) multiplied by a factor involving the wavelength, which depends on the energy.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude f is (from partial waves):

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)/(4π) [ sin(δ_l) e^{iδ_l} ] P_l(cosθ) 

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1 for all l. So the amplitude is sum ( (2l+1)/(4π) ) sin δ_l e^{iδ_l}.

The imaginary part would be sum ( (2l+1)/(4π) ) sin δ_l * sin δ_l? Wait no, wait. Wait, the term is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l multiplied by e^{i δ_l}.

The imaginary part is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * sin δ_l? No, wait, no. Because e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when you take the imaginary part of the term, which is (2l+1)/(4π) [ sin δ_l ( i sin δ_l) ]? No, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the term is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * e^{i δ_l}.

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * sin δ_l. Because e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when you multiply by sin δ_l, the imaginary part is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * sin δ_l.

Wait, no. Wait, the term is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * e^{i δ_l}.

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * sin δ_l.

Wait, because e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when you multiply this by sin δ_l, the term becomes sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l. So the imaginary part is sin^2 δ_l multiplied by (2l+1)/(4π).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The term is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * e^{i δ_l}.

e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So the imaginary part is (2l+1)/(4π) * sin δ_l * sin δ_l = (2l+1)/(4π) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but wait, no, because when you take the imaginary part of the entire term, it's the coefficient of the i term. So the term is (2l+1)/(4π) [ sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) ].

So, breaking it down:

= (2l+1)/(4π) [ sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

So the imaginary part is (2l+1)/(4π) sin² δ_l.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because earlier I thought it was (2l+1)/(4π) sin δ_l, but actually, it's sin squared delta.

So let me correct myself. The imaginary part Im f(0) is sum over l of [ (2l+1)/(4π) sin² δ_l ].

Wait, but that can't be right because for δ=90 degrees, sin delta is 1, so sin² is 1, and that would make each term (2l+1)/(4π). Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me refer back to the correct formula.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, k, k') = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) (k/k') [ sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} P_l (cosθ) ]

But I might have some confusion about the exact factors. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} ] P_l (cosθ)

Wait, but I think I'm getting mixed up here. Let me see: in partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude f is expressed as:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} ) / (k (2ik)^{-1} ) ) ] P_l (cosθ)

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact expression.

Wait, the standard expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] P_l (cosθ)

But since e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l} ) ) which is 2i sin δ_l e^{iδ_l}.

So, e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So substituting back:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l (cosθ)

Simplify:

= (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l

The 2i cancels with 1/(2ik), leaving (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l.

So, f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ).

So, taking the imaginary part along θ=0.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part Im f(0) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin δ_l, because e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so when multiplied by sin δ_l, the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So,

Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the formula is sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δ_l, multiplied by 1/k.

So, with k being the wave number.

Now, the electrons have energy E=50 MeV. So, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2m E) ) / ħ, but perhaps in natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, but I need to calculate it properly.

Wait, in units where ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm), then the momentum p is given by sqrt(2 m E). Wait, but for non-relativistic speeds, but 50 MeV electrons are relativistic. Hmm, but perhaps for simplicity, we can use the relativistic expression for the momentum. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic treatment. Let me think.

The energy of an electron is given by E = (p²)/(2m) + m c², but wait, for high energies, E≈pc. But 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. So for 50 MeV, E≈pc. So p = E/(c), approximately.

But in natural units (ħ=c=1), p = E. But when calculating k, we have:

k = p / ħ.

Wait, but let me get the exact formula.

The wave number k is defined as p/ħ, with p being the momentum.

In natural units, c=1, so p ≈ E (since E = pc when non-relativistic is not valid, but at high energies E≈pc). Wait, wait, actually, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So for E=50 MeV, much larger than m c²=0.511 MeV, so we can approximate E≈ pc → p≈E/c.

But let's compute it more accurately. Let me use natural units where c=1, ħ=197.33 MeV fm (since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm). Wait, no, wait, in natural units, c=1, so ħ has units of MeV·fm. Because ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So, without natural units, ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c. Since c is in units of fm per MeV? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of E.

Wait, let's calculate k. The wave number k is given by:

k = p / ħ

p is the momentum, which is sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find k in terms of the energy. The relation between the wave number k and the energy E is given by:

E = (ħ² k² )/( 2 m_e )

Wait, no, that's the non-relativistic expression. For high energies, E = sqrt( (ħ c k )^2 + (m_e c^2 )^2 )

But perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic relation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the non-relativistic formula, which would be E = p²/(2m). 

But given that the electrons are 50 MeV, which is much higher than their rest mass, the non-relativistic formula isn't accurate, but perhaps the problem assumes it.

Wait, let's proceed.

Assuming non-relativistic:

E = p²/(2m_e)

So p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

Then, k = p / ħ.

So, calculate k:

m_e = 9.10938356 ×10^-31 kg

E = 50 MeV = 50 × 1.602176634 ×10^-13 J ≈ 8.01088 ×10^-12 J.

But in terms of units, perhaps it's easier to use ħ in MeV·fm.

Wait, ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

Wait, but I'm getting confused with units again. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, in natural units, E (in MeV) is equal to p (in units of MeV/c) multiplied by c. So, for E = 50 MeV, p = E / c.

But in natural units, since c is 1, p would be 50 MeV/c. Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for k is:

k = (2m E )^{1/2} / ħ

But with E in energy units and m in kg.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate it in steps.

First, m_e = 9.10938356e-31 kg

E =50 MeV =50 × 1.602176634e-13 J = 8.01088317e-12 J.

So, compute p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

p = sqrt(2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088317e-12 J )

Compute the product inside the square root:

2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01088e-12 = 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01088e-12

First compute 9.10938e-31 *8.01088e-12 = 9.10938 *8.01088e-43 ≈ 72.980e-43 =7.298e-42.

Multiply by 2: 1.4596e-41.

Take square root: sqrt(1.4596e-41) ≈ 1.208e-20.5 (wait, sqrt(1e-40) is 1e-20, so sqrt(1.4596e-41) is sqrt(1.4596) *1e-20.5 ≈ 1.208 * 3.16e-21 ≈ wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 1.4596e-41 is 1.4596 ×10^-41.

The square root is sqrt(1.4596) × 10^-20.5 ≈ 1.208 × 10^-20.5.

Wait, 10^-20.5 is approx 3.16e-21.

So 1.208 * 3.16e-21 ≈ 3.813e-21 kg·m/s.

That's the momentum p.

Now, compute k = p/ħ.

ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = (3.813e-21 kg·m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s )

But 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², so J·s = kg·m²/s.

So units: (kg·m/s) / (kg·m²/s) ) = 1/(m) → so k is in m^-1.

Compute the value:

3.813e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 3.813 / 1.0545718e13 → 3.813 / 1.0545718 ≈ 3.615, so 3.615e13 m^-1.

Wait, that seems very large. 3.6e13 m^-1 is 36 petameters^-1, which is impossible because an electron wavelength at 50 MeV is very small.

Wait, something is wrong. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, p = sqrt(2 m_e E) → 2 *9.10938e-31 kg * 8.010883e-12 J.

Calculating the product:

9.10938e-31 *8.010883e-12 =9.10938 *8.010883e-43 ≈72.98e-43 =7.298e-42.

Multiply by 2: ~1.4596e-41.

sqrt(1.4596e-41) = sqrt(1.4596) * sqrt(1e-41) → sqrt(1e-41)=1e-20.5 → which is 3.16e-21.

sqrt(1.4596)=~1.208.

So p ≈ 1.208 *3.16e-21 ≈3.813e-21 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = 3.813e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 3.813e-21 / 1.0545718e-34.

Compute the exponent: 1e-21 /1e-34 = 1e13.

So 3.813 / 1.0545718 ≈ 3.615, so 3.615e13 m^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the wavelength λ = 2π/k → λ = 2pi / (3.6e13 ) m ≈ 1.75e-13 m, which is 0.175 picometers.

Wait, but electrons at 50 MeV have a wavelength of about 0.1 picometers, which makes sense.

Wait, so k is 3.6e13 m^-1.

But I need to convert this into 1/fm units because the options are in fm.

1 m = 1e15 fm. So 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So, k =3.6e13 m^-1 → 3.6e13 * (1e-15 fm^-1) ) → 3.6e-2 fm^-1.

Hmm, so k ≈ 0.036 fm^-1.

Wait, that seems more reasonable.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.

k = p / ħ.

p = sqrt(2 m_e E )

m_e =9.10938356e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50 * 1.602176634e-13 J =8.01088317e-12 J.

p = sqrt(2 *9.10938356e-31 *8.01088317e-12 )

Compute 2 *9.10938356e-31 =1.8218767e-30.

Multiply by 8.01088317e-12 →1.8218767e-30 *8.01088317e-12 = 1.8218767 *8.01088317e-42 ≈14.6e-42 →1.46e-41.

p = sqrt(1.46e-41) ≈ 3.82e-21 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ=6.5823e-25 GeV·s → but perhaps in J·s, it's 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k =3.82e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈3.82e-21 / 1.0545e-34 ≈3.62e13 m^-1.

Convert m^-1 to fm^-1: 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So,

k =3.62e13 m^-1 → 3.62e13 * 1e-15 fm^-1 → 3.62e-2 fm^-1 → 0.0362 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but wait, another way to compute k is using the relation E = (ħ^2 k^2)/(2m_e) for non-relativistic, but since E is high, perhaps the relativistic form is better. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation:

k = (2m E )^{1/2}/ħ

Again, m in kg, E in Joules, ħ in J·s.

So,

k= sqrt(2m E ) / ħ.

Plugging in the numbers,

k = sqrt(2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.01088e-12 J ) / 1.0545718e-34 J·s

Compute the numerator:

2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01088e-12 = 1.4596e-41 kg·J.

Wait, 1 J =1 kg·m²/s², so kg·J = kg^2 · m^2/s^2.

So sqrt(kg^2 m^2/s^2 )= kg·m/s → which is the unit of momentum, which matches p.

So sqrt(1.4596e-41) = 3.82e-21 kg·m/s, same as before.

So k=3.82e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 → 3.62e13 m^-1 → 3.62e-2 fm^{-1}.

So, k ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Now, going back to the formula for Im f(0):

Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So, 1/k is 1/(0.0362 fm^{-1}) )= 27.62 fm.

Wait, 1/(0.0362) = approximately 27.62.

Now, compute sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l for l=0 to 4.

Compute each term:

l=0: 2l+1=1; δ=90° → sin²=1 → term=1*1=1.

l=1: 3; δ=67° → sin(67)=approx 0.9205 → sin²≈0.8473 → term=3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5; δ=55° → sin(55)=0.8192 → sin²≈0.6710 → term=5 *0.671=3.355.

l=3:7; δ=30° → sin=0.5 → sin²=0.25 → term=7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9; δ=13° → sin(13)=0.22495 → sin²≈0.0506 → term=9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Now, sum all terms:

1 + 2.5419 =3.5419

+3.355 → 6.8969

+1.75 →8.6469

+0.4554 →9.1023.

So sum≈9.1023.

Now, Im f(0)= (1/k)*sum → 27.62 fm *9.1023 → 27.62 *9.1023 ≈ let's compute.

27.62 *9 =248.58

27.62 *0.1023≈2.827 → total≈251.407.

So approximately 251.4 fm.

Looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number of the electron, and \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts for different angular momentum states \( l \). The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and higher-order phase shifts are ignored.

### Step 1: Compute \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the electron's energy \( E \) by the relativistic relation:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}
\]

Here:
- \( m = 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (electron mass),
- \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} = 8.01088317 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J} \),
- \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

First, calculate the momentum \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{2mE} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01088317 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 3.82 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Now, calculate \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{3.82 \times 10^{-21}}{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Convert \( k \) to \( \text{fm}^{-1} \) (1 m = \( 10^{15} \, \text{fm} \)):

\[
k \approx 3.62 \times 10^{13} \cdot 10^{-15} \, \text{fm}^{-1} = 0.0362 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \)
For each \( l \), calculate \( (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \) and sum the results:

1. \( l = 0 \): \( (2l+1) = 1, \sin^2 \delta_0 = \sin^2 90^\circ = 1 \), so \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \).
2. \( l = 1 \): \( (2l+1) = 3, \sin^2 \delta_1 = \sin^2 67^\circ \approx 0.8473 \), so \( 3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419 \).
3. \( l = 2 \): \( (2l+1) = 5, \sin^2 \delta_2 = \sin^2 55^\circ \approx 0.6710 \), so \( 5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355 \).
4. \( l = 3 \): \( (2l+1) = 7, \sin^2 \delta_3 = \sin^2 30^\circ = 0.25 \), so \( 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \).
5. \( l = 4 \): \( (2l+1) = 9, \sin^2 \delta_4 = \sin^2 13^\circ \approx 0.0506 \), so \( 9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554 \).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im } f(0) \)
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l,
\]

substitute \( k \approx 0.0362 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \) and \( \sum (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx 9.1023 \):

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{9.1023}{0.0362} \approx 251.4 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option is **D) 251.271 fm**.
