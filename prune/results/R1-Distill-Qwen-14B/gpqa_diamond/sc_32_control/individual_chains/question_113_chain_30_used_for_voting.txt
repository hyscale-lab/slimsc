Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, carboxylic acids also show a peak around 1700 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Let me think: the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching) or maybe another carbonyl group if there are conjugated double bonds nearby.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere. Also, since there are multiple peaks, maybe it's a substituted alkene or maybe more than one type of hydrogen in the vinyl group.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment, often corresponding to a CH3COO group or maybe a ketene ion. Alternatively, it might be a result of breaking a specific bond. For example, if the molecule loses a larger fragment, the remaining part could be 45. Another possibility is that the 45 comes from a smaller functional group, like an ethyl group or something similar.

Now, let's think about the possible formulas and what they could represent.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation calculation: For C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be either a ring or a double bond or a carbonyl. But wait, O2 could contribute to that. For example, if it's an ester or a ketone.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU for this would be (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and a double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds, or one double bond and one carbonyl group.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a ring and a double bond or a ring and a carbonyl, or two double bonds, etc.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU.

Now, looking back at the FTIR data: the 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group. The peak at 1650 could be an aromatic ring or an conjugated carbonyl. Wait, if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's a conjugated system. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an ester or another type of carbonyl.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, so that's another DoU. So the compound must have a double bond and a carbonyl group. Let's see:

If the molecule has both a double bond and a carbonyl, that's two degrees of unsaturation. Which options have at least two DoU? Let's check again.

Option A: C6H12O2 has 1 DoU. So perhaps not enough if we have both a carbonyl and a double bond, which would require two. Unless the carbonyl is part of an ester or something that uses one DoU.

Wait, wait. Each DoU accounts for either a ring or a double bond. A carbonyl is a double bond (C=O), so that counts as one DoU. A vinyl group (C=C) is another DoU. So total two DoU.

So which options have two DoU?

Option B: C6H10O has two DoU. But does that include a carbonyl and a double bond? Because O is in the formula, maybe it's a ketone (which is a carbonyl) and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2 has two DoU. Could have a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a peak at 1700, which could be an ester (which has a carbonyl). So if O2 is present, like in an ester group, that would take part in the structure.

But let's think about the possible functional groups.

The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is probably O-H. So the compound could be a carboxylic acid, but those tend to have very broad and strong peaks. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the O-H would also be broad. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe it's something like acrylic acid, which has a double bond and a COOH group.

But the FTIR also has 1650 cm^-1. Carboxylic acids have strong absorption around 1700 and O-H around 2500-3300, which is a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, where the O-H isn't present, but in that case, the broad peak would not be there. Hmm, but the O-H is present because of the broad peak at 3000. So perhaps it's a hydroxy group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the other IR peaks: 1700 and 1650. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. The 1650 could be from conjugated double bonds. Maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Like something like CH2=CHCOO-R.

Alternatively, it could be a ketone with a double bond somewhere else. Let me think.

In the case of the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the compound has a double bond. So perhaps it's an allylic alcohol or an allyl ester. Hmm.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 is CH3COO- (which is 45: 12+16+12+16= that's 12*(2) + 16*(2)= 24+32=56. Wait, no. Maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: m/z 45. Maybe it's (CH3)COH, but that's 45? Let me calculate the molecular weight of CH3COOH (acetic acid): C2H4O2 is 60. Hmm, so 45 is less than that. Alternatively, the fragment could be C3H7O or something. Alternatively, it's a ketene ion (like (CH3)2CO+ would be 58, I think. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2CO+ which is 58? Hmm, not 45. Maybe it's a smaller fragment. Let's think: 45 could be (CH3)CO+ which is 58? No. Wait, let's do the math. 45 is 45. So possible options: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O? Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. Sum is 36+7+16=60. So that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a different approach. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas and what their molecular weights are.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight would be 6*12 +12*1 + 2*16=72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. 6*12 +10*1 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 6*12 +10*1 +32=72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

Hmm, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. So if the molecular ion is, say, 114 for option C, which is 114, then losing 69 would give 45. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base peak is at 45, which could be a small fragment.

Wait, perhaps the fragment comes from cleavage of an ester. For example, if the compound is an ester, say R-O-CO-R', when it breaks, it could lose the R'COO- group, leaving R-O- as a fragment. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion. But I'm not certain about that.

Let me think about the possible structure of the compound based on the data.

The FTIR has a broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1, which suggests O-H. So maybe it's a diol? But then why the carbonyl peaks? Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something with an alcohol and a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. That would have an O-H (if it's opened, but maybe not in the cyclic form). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester? Like ethyl acetoacetate. That has both a carbonyl and a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the compound has a double bond. So maybe it's something like an allyl ester or an allyl alcohol.

Putting this together: O-H (from FTIR), carbonyl (from IR), and a double bond (from NMR). So perhaps it's an allyl ester. Let's think about the structure CH2=CHCOOR (allyl ester). That would have a carbonyl group (ester) and a double bond.

But what's the formula of that? Let's say R is ethyl. Then the formula would be C5H8O2. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, if R is methyl, it's C4H6O2. Hmm, but the options are C6H10O2, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted compound with both an ester and a double bond.

Another angle: The mass spec fragment of 45. Let's think of possible structures that would break into a 45 fragment. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2. Wait, but that would be larger. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3), which has a formula C4H6O2. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a diester or has multiple carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from a cleavage between two carbons. For example, if the molecule is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH (but that's a diol, not sure about the carbonyl).

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like cyclopentanol with an ester group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol. But I'm not certain.

Let me think again. We have O-H (broad peak), carbonyl (1700), and a double bond (vinyl H in NMR). So possible structures could include:

- An alpha-hydroxy ester, like CH2CH(OH)COOR.

- An allyl alcohol with an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cinnamic acid derivative, but that's more of a conjugated system.

Wait, cinnamic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. Its IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid), a carbonyl around 1700, and a conjugated double bond which would have a peak around 1650 (C=C). That matches the IR data. The NMR would show vinyl protons (which it does), and the OH proton would be broad, but since it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad. The molecular formula of cinnamic acid is C9H8O2, but that's not one of the options provided.

Hmm, so maybe the compound isn't a carboxylic acid but something else.

Wait, the options are for C6 compounds. So maybe it's something like methyl vinyl ketone, but that would be an O-containing compound with a double bond and a ketone. But methyl vinyl ketone is C4H6O. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a six-membered ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, etc. Let me calculate their molecular weights again.

Option A: C6H12O2 → 6*12=72 +12=84 +32=116.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 72 +10=82 +32=114.

Option B: C6H10O → 72 +10=82 +16=98.

Option D: C6H12O → 72 +12=84 +16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a peak at 45. For example, if the molecule has a fragment that's 45, perhaps it's a part of the molecule.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's think about degrees of unsaturation. Each DoU is either a ring or a double bond.

Looking at the options:

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU is 2.

Hmm, 2 DoU could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

So, if the structure has a ring (like cyclohexane) and a carbonyl (like cyclohexanone), but that would be a ketone. But then the FTIR would show a strong peak around 1700. Alternatively, if the structure is an ester, which would have a carbonyl.

But wait, the FTIR shows two peaks at 1700 and 1650. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or a conjugated C=C.

Let me imagine a structure: perhaps a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, something like cyclohexene ester, which would have both a double bond and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diester with a double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 could be a small group, maybe a CH3COO- group. Wait, CH3COO- is 59 (12+12+16+16+1=57? Wait, molecular weight of CH3COO- is (12*2)+(1*4)+(16*2)=24+4+32=60. Hmm, not 45. So perhaps a different fragment.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me see: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O. Wait, 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=59. No. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketone ion. For example, (CH3)2CO is 58. So that's not 45. Alternatively, it could be a smaller fragment.

Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O. Let me calculate that: (12*2) + (2*2*1) +16=24 +4 +16=44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, (CH3)O- would be 31. No.

Hmm, perhaps it's a COOCH3 group losing something. COOCH3 is 60 (12+16+16 +12+1+1=60?). No, wait, COOCH3 is (12*2)+(16*2)+(12+3)=24+32+15=71. That's not helping.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the result of a McLafferty rearrangement? I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a simple loss of a group.

Another angle: Perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is option C, then the molecular weight is 114. If the fragment is 45, then the loss would be 114 -45=69. But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another part. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an orthoester or some other structure. Hmm.

Let me think about the NMR again. Vinyl hydrogens in the NMR probably mean a trans or cis substituted alkene. So the presence of vinyl protons suggests that the H's are on double bond carbons.

Putting it all together, let's try to assign.

The presence of O-H (from IR), carbonyl (IR), and a double bond (NMR) suggests the compound has a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond.

So, possible structures could be:

1. An alpha-hydroxy ester: RCOOR' with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon.

2. A beta-hydroxy ester.

3. An allyl alcohol with an ester group.

Wait, considering the molecular formula, let's say it's an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. So, for example, if R is ethyl and R' is allyl, the formula would be C5H10O2. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. So, for example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage would have the formula C6H10O2. That's option C. Let me check: a six-membered lactone would have a structure like O-CO-O in the ring, but wait, no. Wait, a lactone is a cyclic ester, like gamma-butyrolactone is a five-membered ring. So a six-membered lactone would have the structure where an alcohol and a carboxylic acid are connected in a ring. For example, something like HOOC-(CH2)3-O in a six-membered ring. Wait, but that would require at least five atoms between the O and the COOH. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, in any case, the formula C6H10O2 would have a DoU of 2. So if it's a lactone, that's a ring (which is one DoU) and the ester carbonyl (another DoU). So that's two DoU, which fits.

But wait, the IR shows a broad absorption around 3000, which would correspond to an O-H group. But in a lactone, the ring is formed by an ester group, so there's no free O-H. Unless it's a substituted lactone with an additional hydroxyl group. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the compound isn't a lactone. Let me think again.

If the compound has both a carbonyl (like an ester) and a hydroxyl group (like an alcohol), then it's an alcohol with an ester. The formula would be something like R-OH and an ester group R'COOR''. But then the molecular formula would have more oxygens. Wait, but the options have O2 for C6H10O2 and O2 for C6H12O2.

Wait, let's think of an example: suppose the compound is benzyl alcohol. But that's C7H8O, which isn't our option. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclohexanol, which is C6H12O. That's option D. But cyclohexanol's FTIR would show a broad O-H peak, and no carbonyl. But our IR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So cyclohexanol wouldn't match.

So back to the drawing board.

The presence of a carbonyl (1700) and O-H (3000) in the IR suggests that the compound has both, but if it's an ester, then the O-H would be part of an alcohol, not a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps it's an ester with a free -OH group. For example, something like RCOOR' where R' has an -OH group.

Wait, but that would require two O's. The formula would be something like CnH2mO2. So option C is C6H10O2, which fits.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an acetylated alcohol, like R-O-CO-R''.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a fragment at m/z 45. Let me see the molecular formula of option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 114. If the molecular ion is at 114, then a fragment at 45 suggests a loss of 69 (114-45=69). But 69 is a possible loss, perhaps of a larger group.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the breakdown of the molecule into smaller parts. For example, if the molecule has an ester group that breaks into two parts. If the ester is R-O-CO-R', then the loss of R'COO- would leave R-OH. Let me calculate the molecular weight of R-O-.

Wait, if the fragment is 45, then R-O- would have a molecular weight of 45. So R-O- would be 45. Let's see: R is an alkyl group. For R-O-, the formula is CxHyO. The molecular weight is 45. So:

12x + y +16 =45.

Possible options:

x=2: 24 + y +16=40 +y =45 → y=5. So R-O is C2H5O. Oh wait, but C2H5O would be 45? Let me calculate: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. Sum is 45. Yes. So R-O- could be ethoxy (C2H5O-). So the fragment could be ethoxy (CH2CH2O-) with a charge of +1, giving m/z=45.

If that's the case, then the ester part would be RCOO-. So the full ester would be RCOOCH2CH3. The RCOO- would be part of the original molecule.

So putting it together, the molecule would be RCOOCH2CH3, where R is something with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. Wait, but the options have to fit into the given formulas.

Wait, the molecular formula of the compound would be C6H10O2. Let's think: if the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, then the R group would be C3H5O. Wait, because RCOOCH2CH3 would be C(n+2)H(2n+3)O2. Let me see: for RCOOCH2CH3, R is CxHyO, then the ester is Cx+2 H2y+3 O2.

Wait, but if the entire formula is C6H10O2, then RCOOCH2CH3 would be: R is C3H5O, because RCOOCH2CH3 would be (C3H5O) (COO) (CH2CH3) → C3+2+1=6, H: (5 +3 + 5)=13? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (CH2CH2O)COOR', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like CH2CH2O-CO-O-R, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps another approach. If the fragment is 45, which is the ethoxy group (C2H5O, 45), then the remaining part would be RCO-. The molecular formula of the compound is C6H10O2. If the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, then R would be C3H5O (since RCOOCH2CH3 = C3+2=5? Wait, but that doesn't add up because the formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, maybe the ester is CH2CH2CO-O-R, where R is something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is not from the ester part but from elsewhere.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to match the options with the data.

Option C is C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So it could have a ring and a carbonyl or a double bond and carbonyl.

The FTIR shows O-H (broad), carbonyl (1700), and possibly a double bond (1650). So it would fit if the structure has an O-H, carbonyl, and double bond.

So if the structure is an ester with a double bond and an O-H group, that would fit.

Alternatively, it's a dihydroxy compound with a carbonyl. But the DoU is 2, so that's possible.

Another thought: the 1650 cm^-1 peak could be from an aromatic ring (C=C stretch). But the options don't have aromatic formulas, as they are all aliphatic (C6H10O2 would be something like a cyclic ester or a diester with a double bond).

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are typically from alkenes, not aromatic rings. So aromatic protons would be different.

So, putting it all together, the compound has an O-H, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

So the formula must have O2 and two DoU. So that points to option C (C6H10O2) or option B (C6H10O) which has two DoU but only one O.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H. The presence of O-H and a carbonyl (ester) would require at least two O's, so the formula must have O2. That removes options B and D, which have only one O.

So the options are either A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, the degrees of unsaturation. For option C, 2 DoU. The structure would need a double bond and a carbonyl (each contributing one DoU), which fits the data.

For option A, 1 DoU, which may not be enough because it needs both a double bond and carbonyl.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-calculate DoU for options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU.

So if it has a carbonyl group (which is one DoU), then no room for a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So that's a problem. So option A is probably out.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So that can accommodate a double bond and a carbonyl.

That makes more sense. So the structure would have both a double bond and a carbonyl, plus an O-H group.

So option C is more likely.

Now, the mass spectrum. If the compound is C6H10O2, and the fragment is 45, which is likely the ethoxy group (C2H5O), then the rest would be RCO-. So RCO would be C4H5O. Wait, C6H10O2 minus C2H5O is C4H5O. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, breaking the ester into the acid part and the alcohol part.

If the compound is RCOOR', where R' is ethyl, then the molecular formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. R would be C4H7O? No, because RCOOCH2CH3 would be R is C3H5O, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is from the ketene ion. For example, if the structure has a carbonyl group and breaks to form a ketene (like (CH3)2CO+), but that's 58, not 45.

Another thought: the fragment at 45 could correspond to the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, like ethanol (46), but that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methylene group with some oxygen.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. Not matching the options. So perhaps it's a larger molecule.

Wait, but the options are for C6. So perhaps a cyclopentene ring with an ester group. For example, something like cyclopentene ester.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think of possible structures.

If the formula is C6H10O2, possible structures include:

- An ester with a double bond and an O-H group (but not sure how that would fit).

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's see: that would be C6H10O2. Yes, because CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 is C6 (since 2 from CH2=CH, 2 from CH2COO, and 2 from CH2CH3), but wait, let me count:

CH2=CH (2 C), CH2COO (3 C), CH2CH3 (2 C) → total 2+3+2=7. Hmm, no, that's not right. Maybe I'm not counting correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl acetate. But that would be C7H10O2, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, cyclohexene with an ester substituent.

But I'm not sure.

In any case, based on the FTIR and NMR data, the compound has an O-H, a carbonyl, and a double bond. So the formula must have O2 and two DoU. That points to option C (C6H10O2).

The mass spec fragment at 45 is a bit confusing, but considering the options, and the other data, option C seems the most likely.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options provided are:

- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**  
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**  
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**  
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

### Key Analysis:

1. **FTIR Data**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group (likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid).  
   - Strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond or aromatic system.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond (C=C).

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a small fragment, possibly an ethoxy group (C₂H₅O, molecular weight = 45).

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:  
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 1. This suggests one ring or double bond, but the data indicates the presence of both a double bond and a carbonyl group, requiring two DoU. Thus, this option is unlikely.  
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: DoU = 2. This accounts for a double bond and a carbonyl group. However, it has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the broad O-H peak in the FTIR spectrum.  
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: DoU = 2. This accounts for a double bond and a carbonyl group. The two oxygen atoms are consistent with the presence of both an O-H group and a carbonyl group (e.g., an ester or alcohol). This matches the FTIR and NMR data.  
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: DoU = 1. Similar to Option A, this suggests one ring or double bond, but the data indicates the presence of both a double bond and a carbonyl group, requiring two DoU. Thus, this option is also unlikely.

5. **Mass Spectrometry Fragment (m/z = 45)**:  
   - The fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with an ethoxy group (C₂H₅O). This aligns with the structure of an ester or alcohol, which is consistent with Option C.

### Conclusion:  
The compound must have two degrees of unsaturation (a double bond and a carbonyl group), as well as two oxygen atoms to account for the O-H and carbonyl groups. The mass spectrometry data further supports the presence of an ethoxy fragment. Based on this analysis, the most likely chemical formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

**Answer: C**
