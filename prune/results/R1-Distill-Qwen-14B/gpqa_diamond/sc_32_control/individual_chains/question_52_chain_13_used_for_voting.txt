Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and think about how to approach it.

The question is about a star and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall temperature changes, which in turn affects the ionization and excitation states of the atoms in their photosphere.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, how does that happen? Oh, right, because the spots are cooler, so the average emitted flux is lower. But for this problem, I think the key is how the temperature affects the ionization and excitation of Ti.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two specific energy levels decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I'm guessing that this is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps visible range. But more importantly, the wavelength relates to the energy difference between the two levels. Because energy (E) is related to wavelength (λ) via E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to calculate the exact energy difference. The key here is the Boltzmann equation, which describes the population ratio in two energy levels. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference between levels 2 and 1, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

So the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels is n2/n1. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. But wait, when the spots are present, 40% of the surface is covered, so does that affect the average temperature in the photosphere? Or is the Teff given the effective temperature of the star as a whole, so the photosphere's effective temperature is lower.

The question mentions that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region is at a certain temperature, and the overall effect is an average. But wait, spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the photosphere is at 6000 K? Or does the entire photosphere's average temperature drop to 5500 K?

Hmm, the problem says when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500K. So the spots are making the star emit less, so the effective temperature is lower. But for the photosphere, I think the temperature structure might change in regions covered by spots. So when spots are present, some parts are cooler and others are at 6000 K? Or does the effective temperature being 5500 K mean that the average of the entire surface is 5500 K?

Wait, no. Effective temperature is determined by the total emitted flux. So the star's luminosity is lower when spots are present because 40% of the area is at a lower temperature. But wait, the problem says the Teff decreases to 5500 K. So the star as a whole has an effective temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. But in reality, the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions.

But for the purpose of this problem, we're told that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region is at its own temperature. But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures. Wait, no, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present. But that can't be right, because spots are cooler regions than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, perhaps the star without spots has a uniform Teff of 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the photosphere has two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a lower temperature. Let's say the spot has Teff Ts. The overall effective temperature (Teff_total) is given as 5500 K.

Wait, but how is the total Teff calculated when part of the surface is at a lower temperature? The effective temperature is such that the total luminosity is L = 4πR^2 σ Teff^4. So when a fraction f of the surface is at a lower temperature T_spot, and the remaining fraction (1-f) is at T_phot.

So the total luminosity is L = (1-f) * 4πR^2 σ T_phot^4 + f * 4πR^2 σ T_spot^4.

But the total effective temperature T_total is such that L = 4πR^2 σ T_total^4.

So,

(1-f) T_phot^4 + f T_spot^4 = T_total^4.

In this problem, f is 0.4, T_phot is 6000 K (since without spots, the Teff is 6000K), and T_total is 5500 K. So we can solve for T_spot.

Let me compute that.

(0.6)(6000^4) + (0.4)(T_spot^4) = (5500)^4.

Compute each term.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12. 5.5^4 is (5^4)* (1.1)^4. 5^4=625, 1.1^4≈1.4641. So 625 *1.4641≈ 914.4375. So 5500^4≈914.4375e12=9.144375e14.

Similarly, 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So,

7.776e14 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.144375e14.

Subtracting:

0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.144375e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.368375e14.

So T_spot^4 = (1.368375e14) / 0.4 = 3.4209375e14.

Take the fourth root: T_spot = (3.4209375e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. Let's express it in terms of 1e14.

We can write 3.4209375e14 = 3.4209375 * 1e14. The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = 1e3.5 = 3,162.27766 approx (since 10^3.5= approx 3162.27766).

So the fourth root of 3.4209375 is approximately the fourth root of 3.42. Let me see, 3^4=81, 3.42 is about 3.42.

Wait, no, I think I'm complicating it. Let me compute in terms of exponents.

Compute ln(T_spot^4) = ln(3.4209375e14) = ln(3.4209375) + ln(1e14) = approx 1.23 + 32.236 (since ln(1e14)=32.236, because ln(e^32.236)=32.236, and e^32.236 is approx 1e14). So ln(T_spot^4)=1.23 +32.236=33.466.

So ln(T_spot)=33.466/4=8.3665.

Exponentiate: T_spot= e^8.3665.

e^8 is about 2980, e^8.3665 is e^(8 + 0.3665)= e^8 * e^0.3665. e^0.3665≈1.442. So 2980 *1.442≈4287 K.

Wait, but that's a very rough calculation. Let me try a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (3.4209375e14)^(1/4).

Approximate:

We can write 3.4209375e14 = 3.4209375 x 10^14.

Take the fourth root: (3.4209375)^(1/4) x (10^14)^(1/4).

(10^14)^(1/4) = 10^(14/4) = 10^3.5 = 3162.27766.

(3.4209375)^(1/4). Let's compute that.

We know that 3^4=81, 4^4=256, so 3.4209 is between 3 and 4, but in terms of the fourth root.

Wait, 3.4209375 is about 3.42.

Wait, 3.42^(1/4): let's compute. Let me compute 3.42^(1/4).

I know that 3.42 is approximately 3.42.

Let me try some approximate numbers. Let me think about what number to the 4th power is 3.42.

Let me try 1.35^4: (1.35)^2=1.8225, then squared again: 1.8225^2 = approx 3.32. That's close to 3.42. So 1.35^4≈3.32. So 1.36^4: (1.36^2)=1.8496, squared again: (1.8496)^2≈3.42. Oh wait, exactly! So 1.36^4 is approximately 3.42.

So (3.42)^(1/4) is approximately 1.36.

So back to T_spot: 1.36 * 3162.27766 ≈ 1.36 *3162 ≈ 4306 K.

So T_spot≈4306 K.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, when 40% of the surface is cooler, and the rest is at 6000 K, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the spot temperature is about 4306 K.

Wait, but let me proceed. Now, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio n2/n1 in the photosphere is affected by the temperature.

In the absence of spots, the photosphere is at 6000 K. When the spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, does the photosphere's temperature change? Or is it a mix of 6000 K and 4306 K regions?

No, wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Hmm, I might have misread that earlier.

Wait, but the problem states: "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that would imply that the spots are causing the entire photosphere to cool, which doesn't make much sense physically. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average temperature of the entire photosphere as 5500 K, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. So in the presence of spots, the average temperature of the photosphere might be 5500 K, but the individual regions have higher or lower temperatures.

But for this problem, since the photosphere is in LTE, each region is at its own temperature, so when we have spots, part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature, and the rest remains at 6000 K.

But when calculating the average ratio of Ti levels, how does that work? Because the ratio of n2/n1 depends on temperature, so in different regions, the ratio would be different.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels decreases. So perhaps what they're considering is the average ratio over the entire photosphere. But that's more complicated because it would require integrating over the different temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is oversimplified, and you can just compare the ratio at 6000 K and 5500 K, assuming the entire photosphere is at that temperature when spots are present.

Wait, but the problem says "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that doesn't make sense physically because the spots are cooler regions. So perhaps the problem is considering that the average temperature is 5500 K, but that would involve a combination of regions.

But given that the problem is multiple-choice and probably expects a straightforward approach, perhaps the intended solution is to compute the ratio at 6000 K and 5500 K, and find the ratio of the ratios.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spot-free (6000 K), the ratio is higher, and when it has spots (5500 K), the ratio is lower.

Wait, but the ratio depends on temperature as per the Boltzmann factor. The ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ). Since ΔE is positive, as temperature T increases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases, so the ratio increases. So higher T leads to higher n2/n1.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Let's say E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential term increases. So n2/n1 increases with T if g2/g1 is constant.

So when the temperature is higher, the ratio n2/n1 is higher, and when temperature is lower, the ratio is lower.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K), so n2/n1 is lower. That's consistent with what the problem says.

So the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

But wait, in the presence of spots, are all regions at 5500 K? Or is it a mix of 6000 K and 4306 K regions?

Hmm, if it's a mix, then the overall ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios in each region. But that complicates the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which would be a simplification.

But given that the problem says that when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is covered by spots, perhaps the photospheric temperature has two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot ≈4306 K (as calculated earlier).

So the average ratio would be the average of the two ratios, weighted by their area coverage.

Wait, but each region contributes according to their area and their emission. But wait, the ratio is a number ratio, not an emission line ratio. So for the entire photosphere, the number of Ti atoms in each level would be the sum from each region.

So n2_total = n2_hot * 0.6 + n2_cool * 0.4.

Similarly, n1_total = n1_hot *0.6 + n1_cool *0.4.

So the overall ratio R_total = (n2_total)/(n1_total) = [0.6*(n2/n1)_hot + 0.4*(n2/n1)_cool ] / [0.6*(n1)_hot + 0.4*(n1)_cool ].

Wait, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. So the question is to compute the ratio of (n2/n1) at 6000 K to (n2/n1) at 5500 K.

Because the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So we can compute (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

If I proceed with that approach, let's compute it.

First, calculate the ratio for each temperature.

The ratio is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

Assuming that g2/g1 is the same for both temperatures (because the statistical weights don't change), the ratio of the ratios would be:

[ (n2/n1)_6000 ] / [ (n2/n1)_5500 ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, let me see:

(n2/n1)_T = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio is [ exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k *5500) ) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k 6000) + ΔE/(k 5500) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Wait, because:

exp(a - b) = exp( (a) - (b) ) = exp( (a - b) )

So:

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Compute the term in the exponent.

Compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500 * 6000) ) = 500/(5500 *6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) ≈ 1.51515e-6.

So (ΔE/(k)) * (1.51515e-6) )

But what is ΔE? Because the transition corresponds to λ=1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 meters. The energy can be calculated using E= hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 m.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 /1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 /1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So E = 1.373e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5 K.

1.373/1.38≈0.995 ≈1. So ΔE/(k) ≈1e5 K.

So the exponent becomes:

(1e5 K) * (1.515e-6) = approx 0.1515.

So the ratio is exp(0.1515) ≈ e^0.1515.

e^0.15 is about 1.1618. e^0.1515 is a bit higher, say 1.163.

So the ratio is approximately 1.163.

But wait, the problem is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ≈1.163. So the ratio increases by a factor of ~1.16.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1.1. But wait, my calculation gives ~1.16. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the exponent.

ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= (1.373 /1.38 ) * 1e5 K.

1.373/1.38 is approximately 0.99565, so 0.99565e5 = 99565 K.

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no:

Wait, 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 /1.38) * (1e-18 /1e-23) )= (0.9956) *1e5 = 99560 K.

So, 99560 K. Then, multiply by (1/5500 -1/6000 )= 1.51515e-6.

99560 * 1.51515e-6 = ?

Compute 99560 *1.51515e-6.

99560 ≈1e5.

1e5 *1.51515e-6 = 0.151515.

So 99560 *1.51515e-6 ≈ 0.1515 * (99560/1e5) )= 0.1515 * 0.9956≈0.1509.

So exponent is 0.1509.

e^0.1509 ≈ e^0.15 is ~1.1618, e^0.1509 is about 1.162.

So the factor is approximately 1.16, which is about 1.1.

But the options have A as ~1.1, which seems close. But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 is the factor by which it increases, so the answer is about 1.16, which is close to 1.1. But the options don't have 1.16. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

Hmm, 1.1 is the closest. But I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, so we're comparing T=6000 K to T=5500 K, but perhaps the factor is larger.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the exponent. Let me re-express the ratio.

Wait, (n2/n1)_T = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So the ratio of the two ratios is [ exp(-ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) )

Which is the same as what I did earlier. So the exponent is positive 0.15, leading to e^0.15≈1.16.

But wait, another approach. Let me compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

At T1=6000 K, (n2/n1)_T1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

At T2=5500 K, (n2/n1)_T2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio (T1)/(T2) is [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Which is the same as before.

So the same calculation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio to be the reciprocal. Because when the temperature is lower, the ratio is lower. So the factor is how much higher the ratio is when T is higher.

So the factor is 1.16, which is closest to option A, ~1.1.

But wait, the options don't have 1.16. So perhaps the problem is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, so the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = e^(ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000 )).

Wait, the same calculation as before, so 1.16.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exponent more accurately.

Compute (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) )= 5/(330,000) = 1/(66,000) ) = approx 0.0000151515.

So 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = 99565 K.

Multiply by 0.0000151515: 99565 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 1.508.

Wait, 99565 * 0.0000151515:

Let me compute 99565 * 1.51515e-5.

99565 * 1.51515e-5 = (approx 1e5) * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.

Wait, 1e5 *1.515e-5 = 1.515. But 99565 is a bit less than 1e5 (1e5 is 100,000), so 99565 * 1.515e-5 = approx 1.515 * (99565/1e5) ) = 1.515 *0.99565≈1.508.

So the exponent is 1.508.

e^1.508 ≈4.5.

Wait, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. e^1.508 is about 4.51.

So the ratio is approximately 4.5.

That's option C.

Wait, wait, this is conflicting with previous calculation. So where did I go wrong before?

Ah, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Let me do this again.

Compute (ΔE/(k)) * (1/5500 -1/6000).

We have ΔE/(k) = 99565 K.

(1/5500 -1/6000 ) = (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) )=500/(33,000,000 )=1/(66,000 )= approximately 0.0000151515.

So 99565 * 0.0000151515 = ?

Let me compute 99565 * 0.0000151515:

99565 * 0.000015 is 1.493475.

99565 *0.0000001515 is approximately 0.01506.

So total is approx 1.493475 +0.01506=1.5085.

So exponent is 1.5085.

e^1.5085≈ e^1.5 ≈4.4817; e^1.5085 is slightly higher.

Compute e^1.5085:

We can use the Taylor series or linear approximation around 1.5.

e^1.5 =4.4817.

The derivative of e^x is e^x. So for x=1.5, the slope is 4.4817.

The difference from 1.5 is 0.0085. So e^1.5085 ≈ e^1.5 + 4.4817 *0.0085.

4.4817 *0.0085= approx 0.0381.

So e^1.5085 ≈4.4817 +0.0381=4.5198.

So approximately 4.52.

Thus, the ratio (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ≈4.52.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Ah, that makes sense. So the factor is about 4.5.

So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze how the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the ratios at the two temperatures is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\)
Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 99565 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The term \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (99565)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.508.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the ratio
The ratio of the ratios is:

\[
\exp(1.508) \approx 4.52.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This corresponds to option **C**.
