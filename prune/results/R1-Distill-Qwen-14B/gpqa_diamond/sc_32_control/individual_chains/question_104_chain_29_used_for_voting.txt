Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's presence and some of its characteristics.

The problem says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. So the planets are probably gas giants but not as massive as Jupiter. Both have circular orbits, which simplifies things because eccentricity doesn't come into play.

The RV method detects the Doppler shift. Planet #1's spectral line shifts by up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's by 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So we need to find Period2 / Period1.

Wait, what determines the RV shift? I recall that the RV semi-amplitude (K) depends on several factors like the planet's mass, the orbital period, the inclination of the orbit, and the mass of the star. The formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 day in seconds)) * (period)^(−1/3)

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ] * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) * (1/ ( (P/(2π))^{1/3} )) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun, so M_p/M_star is negligible), the denominator (1 + M_p/M_star) can be approximated as 1, so it's approximately:

K ≈ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

But wait, another version I think more precisely is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can ignore it in the denominator. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1 - e²) is 1. So K becomes:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * c^(-1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula that relates the semi-amplitude K with the orbital period P. Another approach: K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), assuming the same M_star and sin i (which I think is 90 degrees, edge-on orbit, so sin i is 1, but the problem doesn't specify, but since it's the same for both planets, sin i would cancel out when taking the ratio).

Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is same for both. Also, M_p for both is similar to Neptune. So M_p is same for both, so M_p cancels out in the ratio.

So the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). Because K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, that's the key part. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me make sure. Let me think about the formula again. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (c)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me look for the formula more accurately. The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(2π G))^(1/3) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the simplified version, considering M_p << M_star and e=0.

Another approach: the formula is K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But perhaps that's complicating. Let me think about the relation between K and P. The important point is that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3.

Wait, wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller, because K is larger when P is smaller. Because K = (1/P^(1/3)) * other constants.

Wait, so K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write it correctly. Let's think:

K1 ∝ 1/(P1)^(1/3)
K2 ∝ 1/(P2)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But in the question, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides.

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct. Because K1 = (some constant) * (1/P1^(1/3))

Similarly K2 = (same constant) * (1/P2^(1/3))

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Yes, because K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3

Wait, that would make P2 smaller than P1. Because (5/7) is less than 1, so when cubed it's even smaller. So P2 is shorter in period than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if P2 is shorter, then the ratio is less than 1. So for example, if the ratio is 0.36, then P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's shorter.

Wait, but let's compute (5/7)^3. 5/7 is about 0.714. 0.714^3 is approximately 0.364. So P2/P1 = 0.364, so the period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter.

But the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So it's (P2)/(P1) = 0.364, so it's shorter, not longer. So the period is 0.364 times, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer. So the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the logic. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K implies shorter period. So planet #2 has higher K (7 >5), so its period must be shorter than planet #1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, which matches our calculation of ~0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer. So the answer is option A: ~0.36.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider if the formula is K proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) or to (1/P^(something else)). Let me think about the formula again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/1) * (2π / (c * P) )^(1/3)

Wait, I'm probably getting mixed up. Let me try to find the correct formula. The correct formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / ( (2π G)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Given that K1=5, K2=7, so 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1)

5/7 is approximately 0.714, and 0.714^3 is approximately 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's ~0.36 times as long, so the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1. So the answer is option A.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is A: ~0.36.

The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \), we find:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
