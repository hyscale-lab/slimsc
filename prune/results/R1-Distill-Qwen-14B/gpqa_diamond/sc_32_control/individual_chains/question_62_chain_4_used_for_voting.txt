Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group attached. The substituent is at the 1-position, which is the same as the position where the formyl group is attached. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that would be a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH) group, which in turn is attached to the main cyclohexane ring.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, that's a CH2 group where one H is replaced by a hydroxyl (OH) group, attached to a cyclohexyl (cyclohexane) ring. So, the structure is something like:

Cyclohexane ring - CH(OH) - cyclohexane.

So the main molecule is a cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO) and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a CHO group at carbon 1. The substituent is at the same carbon? Or is it a separate carbon?

Wait, the numbering might be such that the substituent is on the adjacent carbon. Wait, the IUPAC name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a substituent on carbon 1, which is the same as the carbaldehyde group. Wait, that can't be because the carbaldehyde is at position 1. So the substituent is on the same carbon as the CHO group? That would make it 1-(substituent)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, or maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group on C1, and a CH(OH)Cyclohexyl group also on C1. So, the C1 has both a CHO and a CH(OH)Cyclohexyl group. That seems possible but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on a neighboring carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's more like the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group. So, it's cyclohexyl attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is then attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows: a cyclohexane ring (let's call it ring A) with a CHO group on C1. Then, on C1, there is another group: a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexane ring (ring B). So, ring A's C1 has both a CHO and a CH(OH)-ring B.

Alternatively, the substituent could be on a different carbon. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But perhaps instead of getting stuck on the structure, I should think about the starting material and the possible reactions.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond, so HC≡C- attached to cyclohexane). So, it's cyclohexane-ethyl group with a triple bond.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane would be like cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡C-, so maybe cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or perhaps cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2 group? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent that is a triple bond to a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Ethynyl is the substituent, so it's probably cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane attached to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon (so HC≡C- attached to the cyclohexane).

Now, the target molecule has a cyclohexane with a formyl group and a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group will be transformed into the formyl group.

Wait, what reactions can convert a terminal alkyne into a carbonyl group? I remember that oxymercuration or hydroboration can add to the triple bond, but another method is Ozonolysis. Wait, but for an alkyne, perhaps using O3 followed by Zn or other reagents can break it into two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe using a dihydroxylation or some other method.

Wait, but what about using NaNH2 and methyl chloride? Oh, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, especially in alkynyl systems. Maybe it's used for alkyne alkylation.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. If we treat it with NaNH2 (a strong base) and a methylating agent like methyl chloride, perhaps it would deprotonate the alkyne and then methylate. But wait, in terminal alkynes, the acidic proton is the one at the end. So NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, but wait, no, NaNH2 would form the acetylide. So, the alkyne becomes a lithium acetylide, which can then react with an alkyl halide like methyl chloride. So, that would add a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but in this case, the alkyne is already attached to a cyclohexane. So, ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 and methyl chloride would give methylcyclohexane with an acetylide? Wait, maybe it would perform an alkylation on the alkyne. So, maybe the ethynyl group would get a methyl group added to it, making perhaps a propargyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide, then adding methyl chloride would alkylate it. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become methylethynylcyclohexane? Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2C≡CH-cyclohexane? Or is it cyclohexane attached directly to the triple bond? Probably, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, treating with methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide, making a longer alkyne. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexyl-propynyl something.

Wait, perhaps this is the first step: turning ethynylcyclohexane into a propargyl group.

But then, what comes next? The options have different sequences.

Looking at the options, all of them have steps like hydrogenation, oxidation, ozonolysis, etc.

Let me think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is a CHO group attached to a cyclohexane. So, perhaps the ethynyl group needs to be converted into a carbonyl group.

One way to do that is via oxidation. Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives diketones, but perhaps in this case, since it's a terminal alkyne, some other reaction is used.

Wait, but another possibility is to hydrogenate the triple bond into a double bond, and then perform some addition.

Wait, if we hydrogenate the triple bond, we get a cis double bond because hydrogenation of alkynes typically yields cis alkenes. But if we hydrogenate with a poisoned catalyst, perhaps we get full hydrogenation to a single bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted to an aldehyde via a method like the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz reaction, but I'm not too familiar with that.

Alternatively, the alkyne could be converted to a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But that might require more steps.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then hydroboration to form an alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, which is then attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl is formed via some kind of addition to an alkyne or alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a diol via ozonolysis, but that would break the molecule into two, which isn't helpful.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the reagents in the options to get some clues.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd

3. Ba(OH)2

3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, the third step in option A has step 3 as Ba(OH)2 and then another step 3 as H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That looks like an acid workup perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride

2. Li/liq. NH3

3. O3/ H2O

4. NH4OH

So, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: likely alkyne alkylation to make longer alkyne. Then, Li and liquid NH3 could be for Birch reduction? Or perhaps for deprotonating again. Ozone followed by H2O would be ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyls. Then, NH4OH is aqueous ammonia—maybe a workup.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate

3. O3/ (CH3)2S

4. Ba(OH)2

So, step 2 is hydrogenation using H2 and Pd with CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Then, ozone with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup for ozonolysis. Then Ba(OH)2—I'm not sure what that does, maybe a saponification or elimination.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol

2. Li/liq. NH3

3. O3/ (CH3)2S

4. NH4OH

Hmm, NaNH2 and methanol: perhaps a different alkyne reaction, like forming a Grignard? Or maybe it's for deprotonation and then quenching with methanol.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so it's used for deprotonating terminal alkynes to form acetylides. Then, the acetylide can react with an alkyl halide. So, in step 1, ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That would form a methyl-substituted alkyne. So, ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-cyclohexane) plus methyl chloride in presence of NaNH2 would form CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. So, the triple bond is now between the cyclohexane and a methyl group.

Then, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation. So, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, turning CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane into CH2CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making it a single bond. So, CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane becomes CH3-CH2-cyclohexane. So, it's a cyclohexane with a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. After alkylation, it becomes CH2C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the structures.

Wait, let me correct. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

After step 1 with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, the alkyne is deprotonated to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride would add a methyl group. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, a longer alkyne—propynyl group attached to cyclohexane.

Then, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation of the triple bond would produce a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, turning the propynyl group into a propyl group. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because the triple bond is between the CH2 and CH3. So, hydrogenation would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not right. The triple bond is between the two carbons. So, upon hydrogenation, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would just add two H's across. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. HC≡CH becomes CH2CH3 upon hydrogenation. So, if it's CH2-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is butyl group? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, but the group is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Upon hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct because adding hydrogen to triple bond would require more steps. Wait, perhaps I should think of the hydrogenation of an alkyne. The triple bond (sp-hybridized) becomes a single bond (sp3) when hydrogenated. So, the structure would go from CH2-C≡C-CH3 to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not possible because that would imply four carbons in a row with single bonds. Wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm confusing the structure.

Wait, the initial structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. After hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be a four-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem to match the target molecule, which is a cyclohexane with a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think differently.

The target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So, perhaps the ethynyl group needs to be converted into a carbonyl group. How?

One method is to use oxymercuration or other hydration methods, but that's for alkenes. For alkynes, perhaps using HgSO4 and H2SO4 under certain conditions. Wait, I remember that when a terminal alkyne is treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4, it can form a diketone, but that would require an internal alkyne. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene first, then hydroboration is done to get an alcohol, which can then be oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps an alkyne is treated with ozone to form a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via a method like the Stephen reduction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then further oxidized to a diol, which could then be cleaved to form two carbonyl groups. But again, I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the reagents in each option.

Option D, step 1: NaNH2, methanol. So, deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide, then reacting with methanol. Hmm, but methanol is a polar aprotic solvent, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's quenching the acetylide with methanol to form an ethyl group? Wait, no, the acetylide would react with an alkyl halide, but here it's methanol. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a way to make an aldehyde. Wait, I'm not sure.

Option B, step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) to form a lithium acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to make a longer alkyne. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? Then step 2 is Li and liquid NH3. That's probably for Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonation again to form another acetylide. Then step 3 is O3 and H2O, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would break it into two carbonyl groups, but I'm not certain. Then NH4OH as workup.

But I'm not sure if that leads to the target molecule.

Option C, step 2 is H2/Pd, which hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond. Then step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis with a reductive workup typically gives aldehydes and ketones without breaking the molecule apart. Wait, but the molecule after step 2 is a single bond, so how would ozonolysis affect it? Oh wait, maybe the alkyne was hydrogenated into an alkene? No, because H2/Pd would hydrogenate an alkyne to a single bond, not an alkene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after alkylating the alkyne, we hydrogenate it to a single bond, then perform some oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe after the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, we can perform an oxidation to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but what's the target structure? It has a formyl group. So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing the formyl group.

Wait, maybe after alkyne hydrogenation, we can do a cleavage to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, which is then cleaved.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think step by step.

The target molecule: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, there's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a CH(OH) attached to a cyclohexane ring, which is attached to the main cyclohexane.

So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane.

So, the main cyclohexane has a CHO and a CH(OH)Cyclohexyl group at the same carbon.

So, perhaps the substituent comes from a diol or a hydroxyl group on a side chain.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's imagine that we first alkylate it, then hydrogenate, then perform some kind of oxidation or cleavage to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Looking at the options, option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates the alkyne to single bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but wait, after hydrogenation, the triple bond is a single bond, so it's a single bond. Can't ozonolyze a single bond. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Unless I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, we have a longer chain. Then, ozonolysis could break a double bond, but in this case, after hydrogenation, the molecule would be without any double bonds. So, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene. Oh, wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst would give a cis-alkene. But if using H2 and Pd without any poison, it would go all the way to the alkane.

Wait, but in option C, step 2 is H2 with Pd and CaCO3. That's a catalyst for full hydrogenation. So, the alkyne becomes a single bond.

Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. But that would be for ozonolysis, which works on double bonds. So, if after step 2, there's no double bond, maybe this is not the right path.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider each option's steps and see which sequence could possibly lead to the target molecule.

Option A: 

Steps 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer, propargyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond, making a longer chain.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → this is a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

Then step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → this looks like a hydration of a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Option B:

Step 1: Alkyne alkylation with ethyl chloride.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → Birch reduction or deprotonation again.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → breaks double bonds into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But wait, after step 1 and 2, if there's a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. But if the molecule is a single chain with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two fragments. But the target molecule is a single molecule with two substituents on a cyclohexane.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, after deprotonating the alkyne, maybe quenching with methanol would form an ethyl group. But methanol is a good nucleophile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration step, but I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → maybe another alkylation or deprotonation.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes or ketones.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous ammonia, maybe for workup.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate to a single bond, then perform ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but after hydrogenation, the molecule has a single bond, not a double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't work.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde through oxidation.

Wait, for terminal alkynes, one method to form a carbonyl is using a strong oxidizing agent like O3 followed by reductive workup.

Wait, but if you have a terminal alkyne, ozonolysis would usually give two carbonyl groups. But in this case, perhaps we can control it to form just one.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to hydroboration to form an alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, let's suppose that. So, step 1: hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Then, step 2: hydroboration to form an alcohol. Then, step 3: oxidation to a carbonyl group.

But how would that fit into the options?

Looking at option B:

Step 1: Alkylation of alkyne to make a longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → perhaps deprotonation to form an acetylide again, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction of the alkyne to form a diol, but Birch is for aromatic rings.

Another approach: perhaps after alkylating the alkyne, then hydrogenating it to a single bond, forming a longer chain, then performing ozonolysis on a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but after alkylating and hydrogenating, I don't see a double bond.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another angle. The target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl substituent. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another part.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group via some oxidation. How?

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an aldehyde. One way to do that is via the oxymercuration or hydroboration of an alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but I think that the alkyne can be converted into a carbonyl via ozonolysis. For a terminal alkyne, ozonolysis would give a carbonyl group. For example, HC≡C-R would become R-CHO.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is R-C≡CH. Ozonolysis of that would give R-CHO and HCHO (formaldehyde). But I don't think that's helpful because it would cleave the molecule.

Wait, unless we can control the reaction to prevent cleavage. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. Hmm, but that would break the molecule into two parts, which isn't what we want.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a trans-alkene (using a different catalyst), then subjected to dihydroxylation to form a diol, which can then be cleaved to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration, then oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, but how.

Another possibility: the alkyne is first alkylated to make a longer alkyne, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then the single bond is cleaved to form two carbonyl groups. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to make a propargyl group, then hydrogenated to a propyl group, and then oxidized to a formyl group. But how would that happen.

Wait, maybe the propyl group would be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. For example, a primary alcohol oxidizes to an aldehyde, but a primary alkane wouldn't oxidize easily. So perhaps after hydrogenation, introducing an alcohol group via some method would allow oxidation.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl substituent.

So, perhaps the formyl group is from the alkyne, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another part.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first alkylated to form a propargyl group, then hydrogenated to a propyl group, then some kind of oxidation forms the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a different method. For example, using a diethylstilbestrol or other catalysts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about what each reagent does.

Option C: 

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond. So, the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain. How would that form the aldehyde?

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → but this is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyls. But in this case, there's no double bond after step 2. So perhaps the molecule is being oxidized in some way, but I'm not seeing how.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible reagents again.

Option B: 

Step 3 is O3/H2O → which would break any double bonds into carbonyls. So, if after step 2, there's a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is a Birch reduction condition. Birch is usually for aromatic rings, but maybe it's used here for some other purpose. Alternatively, maybe it's used to deprotonate an alkyne again.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is longer. Then, step 2 could be deprotonating and forming another alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reaction that creates a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should try to outline the possible steps that would lead to the target from the starting material.

1. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH).

2. Alkylate the alkyne to make it longer, perhaps to form a propargyl group. So, step 1 would be NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

3. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's a four-carbon chain, which doesn't seem helpful for forming the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group).

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. Then, perform ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. But then how would that form the substituents on the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysed to introduce carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then cleaved using Ba(OH)2 to form a carbonyl.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for saponification or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated and then hydrogenated to an alkane, and then some oxidation takes place.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, another angle: the target has a formyl group. How can that be achieved from an alkyne?

One way is to convert the alkyne into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidize it to a ketone or aldehyde. But how.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol via hydration. Then, oxidize the alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

But how would that fit into the reagents.

Looking at the options, option D's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Maybe that's to prevent over-oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, then oxidized.

Wait, perhaps after step 1 (alkylation), we have a longer alkyne. Then, hydrogenate it to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, perform ozonolysis on a double bond that's formed elsewhere.

But I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to make a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.

3. Ozonolyse to form carbonyl groups.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis isn't possible.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then cleaved to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol. Then, the diol is cleaved to form two carbonyl groups. But again, that would break the molecule into parts.

Wait, unless the diol is on the main cyclohexane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, which is then hydroboration-oxidized to form an alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl group. For example, if there's a beta-hydroxy group, elimination could form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the reagents.

The target molecule has a formyl group, which suggests oxidation of a primary alcohol or aldehyde. Alternatively, the formyl could come directly from an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a formyl group via a single step. For example, using O3 followed by reductive workup.

Looking at the options, option B step 3 is O3/H2O and step 4 is NH4OH. So, perhaps after alkylation and some other step, ozonolysis would break the molecule into the desired parts.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then the single bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but cleavage would require breaking the bond, which would form two carbonyls. So, perhaps the alkyne becomes a longer chain, which is then cleaved into two parts, each with a carbonyl.

But the target molecule is a single molecule, so that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne to make a propargyl group, then hydrogenate to a single bond, then perform some kind of oxidation to form the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from a Grignard reaction or some kind of addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about each option's steps again.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, after deprotonating the alkyne, perhaps quenching with methanol would form a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes a longer chain.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → perhaps this is for Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but I don't see how that applies here.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → reductive ozonolysis, which would break double bonds into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous ammonia, perhaps to protonate.

But again, without a double bond, I don't see how this helps.

Option A:

Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which could induce elimination. So, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, Ba(OH)2 is used to eliminate a molecule, forming a double bond or ketone.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for saponification, but I don't see an ester in the starting material.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the steps in option C.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes longer (propargyl).

Step 2: Hydrogenate to single bond (now a longer chain, no double bonds).

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so maybe not relevant.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let's think about it.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a carbonyl.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 3, Ba(OH)2 is used to eliminate a molecule, forming an alkene. Then, in step 4, hydration would form a diol or a carbonyl.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe after step 2, the molecule is a longer chain, which is then dehydrated by Ba(OH)2 to form a double bond, which is then hydrated or oxidized.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the sequence that forms the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group comes from ozonolysis of an alkyne, but in a way that doesn't cleave the molecule.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and the other part becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, and another part is oxidized to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis, and the other part becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

But how.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is first alkylated to form a propargyl group, then hydrogenated to a single bond. Then, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, forming a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct answer as option C.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has two cyclohexane rings, each with substituents. So, perhaps the alkylation step is adding a cyclohexane group.

Wait, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, so the alkylation would add another group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated with another cyclohexane, but that's not one of the reagents.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. That suggests that a cyclohexane ring is attached to a formyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne.

If the alkyne is converted into a formyl group, then the rest of the molecule would form the hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a formyl group via some oxidizing conditions.

Looking back at the options, which reagent combinations can facilitate that.

Option B: step 3 is O3/H2O, which could break an alkyne into two formyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in option B, step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, so the alkyne becomes longer. Step 2 is Li and NH3, perhaps for deprotonation again. Then step 3 is O3, which would break a double bond into carbonyls. But if the molecule has a double bond after step 2, perhaps ozonolysis would produce the formyl group and another carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that form the cyclohexyl group.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

So, after alkylation (step 1), hydrogenation (step 2), ozonolysis (step 3), and Ba(OH)2 (step 4), which could form the necessary groups.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Alkylate the alkyne → hydrogenate to single bond → ozonolysis (but no double bond, so no effect) → Ba(OH)2 for elimination.

Hmm, I'm not seeing it.

Maybe I should look for which option uses a reagent that can form a carbonyl group from an alkyne.

Option B's step 3 is O3 and H2O, which could break a double bond into carbonyls. So, perhaps after step 2, there's a double bond that's formed, then ozonolysis gives the aldehyde.

Wait, but how would the double bond be formed.

In option B, step 2 is Li and liq. NH3. That could be for deprotonation, perhaps forming a new alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for Birch reduction, which would add hydrogen, but not sure.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, in option A, step 3 is Ba(OH)2 followed by H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then, the acid workup with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which is a catalyst for hydration).

So, suppose after alkylation and hydrogenation, Ba(OH)2 induces elimination, forming a double bond. Then, the acid workup would hydrate the double bond to form a diol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for cleaving an epoxide or saponification, but I don't see an ester here.

Hmm.

This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll go with option C as the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl substituent. The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (-C≡CH). The analysis of the options focuses on how the alkyne can be transformed into the desired functional groups.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the alkyne, resulting in a longer alkyne (CH₃-C≡C-cyclohexane).
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain (CH₃-CH₂-cyclohexane).
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially used for elimination or cleavage.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Likely a hydration or oxidation step.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the formyl group or the hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group is introduced.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (CH₂-C≡C-CH₂CH₃-cyclohexane).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely deprotonates the alkyne or facilitates further alkylation.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous ammonia for workup.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the target molecule is formed, as ozonolysis would require a double bond, which is absent after step 2.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (CH₃-C≡C-cyclohexane).
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain (CH₃-CH₂-cyclohexane).
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially used for elimination or cleavage.

This sequence also does not clearly explain how the formyl group or the hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group is introduced.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to form an ethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely deprotonates the alkyne or facilitates further alkylation.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous ammonia for workup.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the target molecule is formed, as ozonolysis would require a double bond, which is absent after step 2.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly explain how the target molecule is synthesized. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it involves alkylating the alkyne and hydrogenating it to a single bond, which could set up the molecule for further transformations to introduce the formyl and hydroxymethylcyclohexyl groups.

**Answer: C**
