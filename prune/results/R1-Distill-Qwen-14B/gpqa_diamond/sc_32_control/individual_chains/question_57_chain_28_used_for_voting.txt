Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read what the question says.

The problem gives me some phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh, and the electrons have 50 MeV of energy. I'm supposed to ignore any phase shifts beyond these. I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number, and P_l are Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, when θ is 0°, which is along the beam direction. So cosθ is 1. That might simplify things because the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are known. For example, P₀(1)=1, P₁(1)=1, P₂(1)= (3/2), but wait, wait. Actually, for P_l(1), I think it's 1 for all l because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1, since each P_l(1) =1.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The Legendre polynomial P_l(x) at x=1 is indeed 1 for all l. Because, for example, P₀(x)=1, P₁(x)=x, so P₁(1)=1. P₂(x)=(3x²-1)/2, so P₂(1)= (3-1)/2=1. Oh wait, no, wait: 3(1)^2 is 3, minus 1 is 2, divided by 2 is 1. So yes, P_l(1)=1 for any l. So at θ=0°, each P_l(cosθ) is 1.

So the amplitude f(θ=0) simplifies to f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * 1.

But I'm only interested in the imaginary part of f(θ=0). So let's write that out.

f(θ=0) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ]

The imaginary part of f is Im[f] = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l) ]'s imaginary part.

Wait, e^{iδ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when we multiply by sin δ_l, we get:

e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * (sin² δ_l).

So the overall imaginary part is Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, I thought f(0) is sum of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. So each term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. Let me compute the imaginary part of each term.

e^{iδ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. Multiply by sin δ_l:

= sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * sin² δ_l.

So the sum becomes Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l, multiplied by (1/k).

So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression for f was (1/k) times the sum. So the imaginary part would be (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

But wait, I should make sure about the formula. Let me look up the scattering amplitude formula. Oh right, the standard expression is f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ] e^{i (2lφ)}.

But when we're considering θ=0°, then P_l(1)=1, and φ=0 (since the scattering is in the plane of incidence, I guess), so e^{i(2l *0)}=1.

So the sum becomes (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, and the scattering amplitude is (1/k) times this sum.

Therefore, f(0) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^n [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ].

Thus, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^n [ (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) * sin δ_l ].

Wait, because e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l, so the imaginary part is (2l+1) * sin² δ_l.

So the sum is for each l, (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

But wait, in the problem, the given phase shifts are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. So l goes from 0 to 4.

So the sum for Im[f(0)] is (1/k) * [ (2*0+1) sin² δ₀ + (2*1+1) sin² δ₁ + (2*2+1) sin² δ₂ + (2*3+1) sin² δ₃ + (2*4+1) sin² δ₄ ].

So let me compute each term.

l=0: (1) * sin^2(90°)
l=1: 3 * sin^2(67°)
l=2: 5 * sin^2(55°)
l=3: 7 * sin^2(30°)
l=4: 9 * sin^2(13°)

Let me compute each term numerically.

Compute each sin^2 part:

sin90° = 1 → sin²=1 → term is 1*1=1.

sin67° ≈ 0.9205 → sin²≈0.8473 → term: 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.542.

sin55°≈0.8192 → sin²≈0.6710 → term:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

sin30°=0.5 → sin²=0.25 → term:7 *0.25=1.75.

sin13°≈0.22495 → sin²≈0.0506 → term:9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Now sum these terms: 1 + 2.542 = 3.542; +3.355 → 6.897; +1.75 → 8.647; +0.4554 → 9.1024.

So sum is about 9.1024.

Wait, let me compute each more accurately.

sin(67°) ≈ sin(1.16937 radians) → using calculator, sin(67)= approx 0.92050485345.

So sin^2(67) ≈ 0.847315.

So 3 * 0.847315 = 2.541945.

sin(55°)= sin(0.95993 radians) → approx 0.81915204428.

sin^2= (0.819152)^2 ≈ 0.6710.

5 * 0.6710 = 3.355.

sin(30°)=0.5 → sin^2=0.25 → 7 * 0.25=1.75.

sin(13°)= approx 0.224951054 → sin^2=0.050610584.

9 * 0.050610584 ≈ 0.455495.

Adding all together:

1 (l=0) → 1.0000

+ 2.541945 (l=1) → 3.541945

+3.355 (l=2) → 6.896945

+1.75 (l=3) → 8.646945

+0.455495 (l=4) → 9.10244.

So the sum is approximately 9.10244.

Now, the next step is to compute 1/k.

Wait, but what is k? The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, where E is the energy, m the mass of the electron, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but wait, the units. The problem says the scattering amplitude is to be found, and the options are given in fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

So let me compute k in units of 1/m, but perhaps I should compute it in terms of reciprocal fm, because the options are in fm.

Wait, the formula for k is k = sqrt( (2 m E) ) / ħ.

Wait, but I need to get the units right.

Let me double-check the formula:

k = ( sqrt(2 m E) ) / ħ.

Wait, E is the kinetic energy. Oh, but electrons have rest mass, so perhaps we should consider relativistic effects? Hmm, but 50 MeV is way beyond the rest mass of an electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. So relativistic effects are important. Wait, but in the non-relativistic formula, k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but for high energies, perhaps that's not accurate. Alternatively, for high energy, E≈pc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, the relativistic expression is k = (E c^2 / ħ^2 )^(1/2) * something? Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of natural units. Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic formula is good enough here, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (1/fm) because the options are in fm. Let me proceed with the non-relativistic formula and see where that gets me. If that gives an answer close to any option, that's probably the way to go.

So, m_e is the mass of electron, approximately 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg.

E is 50 MeV. Let's convert that to joules. 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J. So 50 MeV is 50,000,000 eV → 5e7 eV.

So 5e7 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.01088e-12 J.

So E ≈ 8.01088e-12 J.

Compute k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

What's ħ? Approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let's compute numerator: sqrt(2 * m_e * E).

Compute 2 * m_e * E:

2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088e-12 J = 2 * 9.10938356e-31 * 8.01088e-12.

Let me compute that:

9.10938e-31 *8.01088e-12 = (9.10938 *8.01088) e-43.

9.10938 *8.01088 is approximately 73.0 (exact: 9.10938 *8=72.875, 0.01088*9.10938≈0.099, so total about 72.974.)

So 72.974e-43 kg·J. But 1 J is kg·m²/s², so units would be kg²·m²/s²? Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Alternatively, let's compute the numerical value.

2*m_e*E: 2 *9.10938356e-31 kg *8.01088e-12 J = 1.46387e-42 kg·J.

Wait, but sqrt( kg·J )? Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so kg·J is kg²·m²/s². So sqrt(kg·J) is kg·m/s.

Wait, but I'm probably getting stuck on units. Let me just compute numerically.

sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(1.46387e-42 kg·J) → sqrt(1.46387e-42) ≈ 1.2098e-21 kg·sqrt(J). Hmm, but this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of inverse meters. Let me proceed step by step.

Compute numerator = sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088e-12 J).

Wait, 2 *9.10938356e-31 = 1.8218767e-30.

Multiply by 8.01088e-12: 1.8218767e-30 *8.01088e-12 = 1.4602e-41.

So sqrt(1.4602e-41) ≈ 3.821e-21.

So numerator is 3.821e-21 m^{-1} ? Wait, no, because 2mE has units kg·J, and J is kg·m²/s², so 2mE has units kg²·m²/s². The sqrt would be kg·m/s. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I should express everything in terms of eV and atomic units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of eV and use the appropriate constants.

Wait, another approach: Use the relation between energy and wavelength.

The de Broglie wavelength λ is given by λ = h / p, where p is the momentum. For a relativistic particle, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. But perhaps at 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/c.

Then, the wavelength λ ≈ h c / E.

But h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So λ ≈ (6.62607e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 50e6 eV.

Wait, but I need to convert eV to joules. 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-12 J.

So λ ≈ (6.62607e-34 *3e8) / (8.01e-12) m.

Compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 *3e8 = 1.987821e-25.

Divide by 8.01e-12: 1.987821e-25 /8.01e-12 ≈ 2.48e-14 m, which is 24.8 picometers (since 1 pm=1e-12 m), or 0.0248 nm.

Wait, but wait, the wave number k is 2π/λ. So k = 2π / λ.

So k ≈ 2π / (2.48e-14 m) ≈ (6.2832) / (2.48e-14) ≈ 2.533e14 m^{-1}.

Wait, but wait, 2.533e14 m^{-1} is a very large number. Let me check if this makes sense.

Wait, 50 MeV electrons are high-energy, so their wavelengths are small, leading to large k.

But let me try to compute this more accurately.

First, compute E in J: 50 MeV = 50,000,000 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-12 J.

Compute p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, m c² for electron is 0.511 MeV, which is much less than 50 MeV, so p ≈ E/c.

So p ≈ E/(c) → 8.01e-12 J / (3e8 m/s) = 2.67e-20 kg m/s.

Then, the wavelength λ = h / p → 6.626e-34 J·s / 2.67e-20 kg m/s.

Compute that: 6.626e-34 / 2.67e-20 ≈ 2.48e-14 m, which is 0.0248 nanometers or 24.8 picometers, as before.

k = 2π / λ → 2π / 2.48e-14 ≈ 2.533e14 m^{-1}.

So k ≈ 2.533e14 m^{-1}.

So 1/k is approximately 3.947e-15 meters, which is 3.947 femtometers (since 1 fm=1e-15 m).

Wait, so 1/k ≈ 3.947 fm.

Wait, but the sum we computed earlier was approximately 9.10244.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum = 3.947 fm * 9.10244 ≈ 35.9 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option B) 355.351 fm, option C) 177.675, and D) 251.271.

Wait, that's nowhere near any of these options. Hmm, did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units when calculating k.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the way I computed k. Let me try again using the correct formula for the wave number.

The correct formula for the wave number k in terms of energy E (in eV) is:

k = (sqrt(2 m_e E)) ) / ħ.

Wait, but E here is in joules. Alternatively, maybe I should express E in eV and use appropriate constants.

Wait, another approach: Use the relation k (in reciprocal femtometers) = sqrt(2 m_e E (in eV)) * 0.529 (1/Å) * (1 fm = 0.1 Å).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me double-check the calculation of k.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the wave number in terms of eV and the Rydberg constant, but I'm a bit rusty.

Let me compute k in terms of inverse meters using the exact formula:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

So, m_e is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

E is 8.01088e-12 J.

So sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.01088e-12 J )

Compute 2 *9.10938356e-31 = 1.8218767e-30.

Multiply by 8.01088e-12: 1.8218767e-30 *8.01088e-12 = 1.4602e-41.

Square root of 1.4602e-41 is sqrt(1.4602) * 1e-20.5.

sqrt(1.4602) ≈ 1.208. So 1.208e-20.5 → 1e-20.5 is 3.16e-21.

So 1.208e-20.5 ≈ 3.81e-21 m^{-1}.

Wait, no, because 1e-20.5 is 3.16e-21, so 1.208 *3.16e-21 ≈ 3.81e-21 m^{-1}.

Wait, but then k = 3.81e-21 m^{-1} / ħ.

Wait, no; wait, the denominator is ħ. So,

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ → 3.81e-21 m^{-1} / (1.0545718e-34 J·s).

Wait, wait, no—actually, 2 m_e E is in kg·J, but J is kg·m²/s². So 2 m_e E has units kg²·m²/s². Taking sqrt gives kg·m/s, which is units of momentum. So when divided by Planck's constant (J·s), which is kg·m²/s, the units would be (kg·m/s) / (kg·m²/s) ) = 1/m. So k is in 1/m, correct.

So, compute the numerator: sqrt(2 m_e E) is 3.81e-21 kg·m/s.

Divide by ħ: 3.81e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 = (3.81 / 1.0545718 )e( -21 +34 ) → approximately 3.612e13 m^{-1}.

Wait, 3.81 /1.0545718 ≈ 3.612.

So k ≈ 3.612e13 m^{-1}.

Wait, 3.612e13 m^{-1} is 3.612e13 / (1e15 m^{-1}/fm^{-1}) ) → 3.612e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, because 1 fm^{-1} = 1e15 m^{-1}.

So k ≈ 3.612e13 m^{-1} = 3.612e13 / 1e15 fm^{-1} = 3.612e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's 0.03612 fm^{-1}, so 1/k is approximately 27.7 fm.

Wait, that's a big change from the earlier calculation. I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's recompute that step by step.

Compute k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ.

Compute sqrt(2 m_e E):

m_e = 9.10938356e-31 kg.

E = 8.01088e-12 J.

So 2 m_e E = 2 *9.10938356e-31 *8.01088e-12 = let's compute this accurately.

2 *9.10938356e-31 = 1.82187671e-30.

Multiply by 8.01088e-12: 1.82187671e-30 *8.01088e-12 = let's compute 1.82187671 *8.01088 = approx 14.602.

So 14.602e-42 → 1.4602e-41.

So sqrt(1.4602e-41) = sqrt(1.4602) * 1e-20.5.

sqrt(1.4602) ≈ 1.208.

1e-20.5 is 3.1623e-21.

So 1.208 * 3.1623e-21 = 3.81e-21 kg·m/s.

Now, divide by ħ: 3.81e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 = (3.81 / 1.0545718 )e( -21 +34 ) → 3.612e13 m^{-1}.

So k = 3.612e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m^{-1} = 1e15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.612e13 m^{-1} = 3.612e13 * 1e15 fm^{-1} = 3.612e28 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, wait—no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So 1 fm^{-1} is 1e15 m^{-1}.

So 3.612e13 m^{-1} equals 3.612e13 / 1e15 fm^{-1} → 3.612e-2 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.03612 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈ 27.7 fm.

Wait, so 1/k is approximately 27.7 fm.

Now, the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l was approximately 9.10244.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * 9.10244 = 27.7 fm * 9.10244 ≈ 252.1 fm.

Looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm, which is very close.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Sum is 9.10244.

1/k is 27.7 fm.

27.7 *9.10244 → let's compute.

27.7 *9 = 249.3.

27.7 *0.10244 = approx 2.835.

So total is 252.135 fm.

But wait, earlier I approximated 1/k as 27.7 fm, but let me compute it more accurately.

Earlier steps:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E)/(ħ) → 3.81e-21 kg·m/s / 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So 3.81e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 = let's compute it precisely.

3.81 /1.0545718 ≈ 3.612.

Exponents: 1e-21 / 1e-34 =1e13.

So k=3.612e13 m^{-1}.

Then, 1/k = 1/(3.612e13 m^{-1}) ) = (1/3.612e13) m.

Convert to fm: 1 m = 1e15 fm.

So, 1/k = (1/3.612e13) *1e15 fm → (1e15)/(3.612e13) ) fm = (1e2)/(3.612) ) fm.

1e2 is 100, so 100/3.612 ≈ 27.70 fm.

So 27.70 fm *9.10244 ≈ ?

Compute 27.7 *9.10244:

27 *9.10244 = 245.766.

0.7 *9.10244 = 6.3717.

Total ≈ 245.766 +6.3717 = 252.1377 fm.

Which is about 252.14 fm.

Looking back at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm.

Way too big.

B)355.351 fm.

C)177.675 fm.

D)251.271 fm.

Our calculation is approximately 252.14, which is very close to option D (251.271). The slight discrepancy could be due to more precise calculation of the sum or more precise values of the sines.

Wait, perhaps I approximated the sin values too much. Let me recompute the sum more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90°) = 1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin²(67°).

Compute sin(67°) accurately. Let's use calculator:

sin(67) ≈ 0.92050485345.

sin² = (0.92050485345)^2 ≈ 0.8473.

3 *0.8473 = 2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²(55°).

sin(55°)=0.81915204428.

sin²=0.81915204428^2 = approx 0.6710.

5 *0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²(30°).

sin(30)=0.5 → sin²=0.25 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13°).

sin(13°)≈0.224951054.

sin²=0.224951054^2 ≈0.050610584.

9 *0.050610584 ≈0.455495.

Sum all terms:

1 +2.5419 =3.5419.

+3.355 →6.8969.

+1.75 →8.6469.

+0.455495 →9.102395.

So sum is 9.102395.

Now, 27.70 fm *9.102395 = let's compute.

27.70 *9 =249.3.

27.70 *0.102395 ≈27.70 *0.1=2.77; 27.70 *0.002395≈0.066 → total about 2.836.

So 249.3 +2.836 =252.136 fm.

So it's about 252.14 fm. The option D is 251.271, which is very close. But perhaps a more precise calculation of 1/k would give a slightly lower value.

Wait, perhaps the initial approximation of E as 50 MeV, but actually, perhaps the rest mass is not negligible. Or perhaps I made an error in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: Use the relativistic relation E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

At 50 MeV, E=50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2 ≈2500 - 0.261 →2499.739 (MeV)^2.

Thus, p c ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.99739 MeV.

So p ≈ (49.99739 MeV) / c.

In units where c=1, p ≈50 MeV.

Now, compute k = p / ħ c.

Wait, because in natural units, k = p/(ħ c).

But I'm a bit confused about the units here.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

k = (sqrt(2 m_e E)) / ħ → non-relativistic formula.

But in this case, E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e c² (0.511 MeV). So the non-relativistic formula might not be accurate, but perhaps it's good enough for this calculation.

Wait, another approach is to compute the momentum p in kg·m/s.

From E=50 MeV =8.01e-12 J.

In relativistic terms, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → compute this in J².

E =8.01e-12 J.

m c² =0.511 MeV =0.511e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV → 8.176e-14 J.

So (m c²)^2 = (8.176e-14)^2 ≈6.685e-27 J².

E² = (8.01e-12)^2 =6.416e-23 J².

So (pc)^2 =6.416e-23 -6.685e-27 ≈6.416e-23 J².

So pc = sqrt(6.416e-23 ) ≈8.01e-12 kg·m²/s.

Thus, p =8.01e-12 kg·m/s / c → 8.01e-12 /3e8 → ~2.67e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p / ħ → 2.67e-20 /1.0545718e-34 ≈2.533e14 m^{-1}.

Wait, that brings me back to the earlier calculation where 1/k ≈3.947e-15 m =3.947 fm.

Wait, but that would imply Im[f(0)] = sum *1/k →9.1024 *3.947 fm → about 35.9 fm. But that's not close to any of the options except perhaps option B, which is 355.351 fm. Hmm, but that's an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, in the calculation where I assumed E≈pc, I had λ=h/(p)= (6.626e-34)/(2.67e-20) ≈2.48e-14 m, leading to k=2π/λ≈2.53e14 m^{-1}.

So 1/k is 3.95e-15 m =3.95 fm. Then, Im[f(0)] =9.1024 *3.95 fm ≈35.9 fm.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in units of inverse femtometers.

Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1/k in meters is 3.95e-15 m → which is 3.95 fm. So 1/k is 3.95 fm.

Then, Im[f] = (1/k) * sum →3.95 fm *9.1024 ≈35.9 fm.

But that's nowhere near any of the options except perhaps option B, which is ~355 fm. This is a factor of 10 difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck the sum.

l=0: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67).

sin(67)≈0.9205 → sin²≈0.8473 →3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 *sin^2(55). sin(55)≈0.8192 → sin²=0.671. 5*0.671=3.355.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13). sin(13)=0.22495 → sin²≈0.05057. 9 *0.05057≈0.4551.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419.

+3.355=6.8969.

+1.75=8.6469.

+0.4551≈9.102.

Hmm, so sum is 9.102.

So if 1/k is 3.95 fm, then 9.102 *3.95 = 35.9.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and I should have used the relativistic expression for k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic formula.

From E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

But E is given in MeV, so let's compute in MeV units.

E =50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2) ≈sqrt(2500 -0.261) ≈sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.99739 MeV.

Thus, p = (49.99739 MeV) / c.

Now, in natural units (ħ c=197.33 MeV fm), the wave number k is p c * (1 fm) / (ħ c).

Wait, perhaps using the formula k = (p c) / (ħ c).

But this is getting tricky.

Wait, another approach: k = p / ħ.

But p is in kg·m/s, so we can compute it.

p = (49.99739 MeV) / c → but we need to convert MeV to J.

49.99739 MeV =49.99739e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV =8.008e-12 J.

p = (8.008e-12 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 2.669e-20 kg m/s.

k = p / ħ =2.669e-20 /1.0545718e-34 ≈2.533e14 m^{-1}.

Which brings us back to the same calculation, giving 1/k≈3.947e-15 m =3.947 fm.

So Im[f] =9.102 *3.947 ≈35.9 fm.

But again, none of the options match, except perhaps option B which is about 355 fm, which is ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere in the calculation of k.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units when computing the wave number k.

Wait, let me recompute k using natural units.

In natural units, c=1, ħ=197.33 MeV fm.

So, E=50 MeV.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) → sqrt(50² -0.511²) ≈49.99739 MeV.

k = p / ħ →49.99739 MeV /197.33 MeV fm → approximately 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈3.947 fm.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum →3.947 fm *9.102 ≈35.9 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the scattering amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) times the sum, not (1/k).

Wait, let me double-check the formula for the scattering amplitude.

In non-relativistic scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l (cosθ).

Wait, so 1/k, not 1/(2ik). So my initial formula was correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Oh wait, in the problem, the phase shifts are given in degrees. Did I convert them correctly?

Yes, because in the calculation of sin(67°), I converted degrees to the sine correctly.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is calculated as the imaginary part of the sum, which would include the (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l term.

Wait, wait, let me re-express the term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l → because e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So, this is (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] * sin δ_l.

= (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ].

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So the sum is sum( (2l+1) sin² δ_l ), which is what I computed earlier as 9.1024.

So the initial calculation is correct.

Hmm, but the calculated Im[f] is about 35.9 fm, which is not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, let me recompute 1/k.

k = p / ħ → p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

E =50 MeV → 50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-12 J.

m c² =0.511 MeV → 0.511e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV= 8.18e-14 J.

So, E² = (8.01e-12)^2 =6.416e-23 J².

(m c²)^2 = (8.18e-14)^2 =6.69e-27 J².

E² - (m c²)^2 =6.416e-23 -6.69e-27 ≈6.416e-23 J².

p c = sqrt(6.416e-23 )=8.01e-12 J·s/m.

Wait, no; p c in J·s/m? I'm a bit confused about units.

Wait, p c has units of energy, since E = pc when E is in J and p is kg·m/s, cOkay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the incident electrons are 50 MeV. I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed as a sum over these phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, this is for each partial wave, and we sum over all l.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. Oh, so we're only considering up to l=4. So l goes from 0 to 4.

The question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ is zero degrees because it's along the beam. So cosθ is 1. That means each Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. Because when you plug x=1 into the Legendre poly, it just gives 1.

So for each l, the term becomes (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) * (1) times (1/(2ik)).

Wait, but the imaginary part of f would be taking the imaginary part of that sum. Let's think about each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) / (2ik). Let me break this down.

e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So when I multiply that by sinδ_l, I get cosδ_l sinδ_l + i (sin^2 δ_l). So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * (sin^2 δ_l) / (2ik).

Wait, but I'm supposed to sum over l from 0 to 4, and then take the imaginary part of the entire f. So the imaginary part of f would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term in the sum.

So the imaginary part Im(f) would be:

Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, yes, because only the imaginary part of each e^{iδ} * sinδ term contributes to the imaginary part of the overall amplitude.

So now, I need to compute this sum over l=0 to 4.

But wait, what is k? Oh, k is the wave number of the electrons. The electrons are 50 MeV. So I need to find k. I remember that the relation between the energy and the wave number for a relativistic particle is something like E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but since the energy is given in MeV and the mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV, 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, so relativistic effects are important.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the momentum p first. Let's think: The kinetic energy is given as 50 MeV, but wait, in high-energy physics, sometimes the total energy is used. Hmm, wait, the problem says "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons". So I think it refers to the kinetic energy, but maybe it's the total energy. Wait, wait, electrons with 50 MeV, if that's kinetic energy, then their total energy is K + m c². But for high energies, K ≈ E. Alternatively, if it's the total energy, then E = 50 MeV. But I'm a bit confused here. Let's clarify.

Assuming that the 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, K. Then the total energy E is K + m c². But for high-energy electrons, maybe we can approximate E ≈ K. But perhaps a better approach is to compute the correct momentum.

The relation between energy and momentum for an electron is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( (E/(c))² - (m c)² ) / c.

Wait, let's compute E. If the problem states the electrons have 50 MeV, I think that's their kinetic energy. So E = K + m c². m c² is about 0.511 MeV. So E = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 MeV. But since 50 is much larger than 0.511, sometimes approximations are made, but perhaps we should compute it accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the 50 MeV is the total energy, so E = 50 MeV. But I think the problem says 50 MeV electrons, which is the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the correct formula.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic relation E = pc, which is a good approximation when E >> m c². Since 50 MeV >> 0.511 MeV, this approximation is valid. So E ≈ pc, and p = E/(c). Wait, but that's only when E is much larger than m c².

So, using E ≈ pc, then p ≈ E / c. So p = 50 MeV / c. Wait, wait, but E is in MeV, and c is in energy units when using natural units where c=1. Wait, perhaps I should work in natural units where c=1, so E in MeV, p in MeV/c, but wait, when c=1, E (MeV) = p (MeV/c) * c, so p = E/(c). Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps I should compute p in units where c=1. So in natural units, c=1, so p = E. But that's only when E is much larger than m c². So if E is 50 MeV (assuming it's the kinetic or total energy), then p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute p correctly.

Let me write down the formula for p:

E² = (p c)² + (m c²)².

So, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / (c).

But if E is 50 MeV, and m c² is 0.511 MeV, then E^2 is (50)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2. m c^2 squared is (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)^2. So E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739.

So, p c = sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV.

So, p = (49.9974 MeV) / c.

But since we're going to compute k, which is the wave number. Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p / (ħ c), but I think I have to be careful with units here.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ c), where p is the momentum, ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express everything in appropriate units. Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ = c = 1, but then when I convert back, perhaps.

Wait, let's see: The standard formula for the wave number k is k = p/(ħ c). So, if p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV fm (since ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV s, but when multiplied by c ≈ 3×10^8 m/s, it becomes around 197 MeV fm).

Wait, wait, I think ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm. So, if p is in MeV/c, then k = p/(ħ c) [in (MeV/c)] / (MeV·fm) ) → (1/(fm)).

So, p = 49.9974 MeV/c, then k = (49.9974 MeV/c) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) = 49.9974 / 197.3 ≈ 0.2534 fm^-1.

Wait, because 197.3 MeV fm is ħ c. So, 49.9974 / 197.3 ≈ 0.2534.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because I'm a bit confused about the units.

Alternatively, perhaps ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So, to compute k, which is p/(ħ c), but p is in MeV/c.

Wait, p = 49.9974 MeV/c. So, p/(ħ c) = (49.9974 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = (49.9974 / 197.33 ) * (1/(c * fm)).

Wait, but 1/c is in seconds per meter, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of units where ħ c is in units of MeV·fm. So, MeV/c is the unit of momentum. So when you divide by (ħ c) which is in MeV·fm, the units would be (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(c fm). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the relation k = (p) / (ħ c). So, for p in MeV/c, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So, k = p / (ħ c) = (49.9974 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = (49.9974 / 197.33) [1/(fm)].

Calculating that: 49.9974 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2534 fm^-1.

So, k ≈ 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but in the formula for f, which is (1/(2ik)) times the sum, so 2ik is 2i times 0.2534 fm^{-1}. So, 1/(2ik) would be (1) / (0.5068i fm^{-1}) ) = (1/0.5068i) * fm.

Wait, 1/(0.5068i) is approximately ( -i ) * 1.973, since 1/i is -i. So, 1/(0.5068i) ≈ (1.973) * (-i) → about -1.973i.

Wait, but perhaps precise calculation is better.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed step by step.

So, Im(f) is (1/(2i k)) multiplied by the sum of (2l + 1) sin² δ_l for l from 0 to 4.

Each term is (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l.

Let me compute each (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l:

For l=0: (2*0 +1) * sin^2(90°) → 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: (2+1) * sin^2(67°) → 3 * sin^2(67). Let me compute sin(67°). sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, so sin^2 ≈ 0.8473. So 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: (5) * sin^2(55). sin(55) ≈ 0.8192, square is ~0.6710. 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3: (7) * sin^2(30). sin(30)=0.5, square is 0.25. 7 *0.25 =1.75.

l=4: (9) * sin^2(13). sin(13) ≈ 0.2249, square is ~0.0506. 9 *0.0506 ≈ 0.4554.

Now sum all these: 1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419; +3.355 →6.8969; +1.75 →8.6469; +0.4554 →9.1023.

So sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, Im(f) = (1/(2i k)) * sum.

We have sum ≈9.1023.

So, Im(f) = (9.1023) / (2i k).

But k is approximately 0.2534 fm^{-1}, so 2k ≈0.5068 fm^{-1}. So 1/(2i k) = 1/(i * 0.5068 fm^{-1}) ) = (1/0.5068) * (1/(i fm^{-1})) ) → wait, this might be getting messy. Let me think again.

Wait, 1/(2ik) is (1/(2i)) * (1/k). Since k is 0.2534 fm^{-1}, 1/k is approximately 3.947 fm.

So, 1/(2ik) = 1/(2i) * 3.947 fm.

But 1/(2i) is equal to -i/(2), because 1/i = -i.

So, 1/(2i) = (-i)/2.

So, 1/(2ik) = (-i/2) * 3.947 fm → (-i * 3.947 ) / 2 fm → (-i * 1.9735 ) fm.

Wait, but wait: Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 1/(2i k) = 1/(2i * 0.2534 fm^{-1}) ) = 1/(0.5068 i fm^{-1}) ) = (1 / 0.5068 ) * i^{-1} * fm.

But 1/i = -i. So,

(1 / 0.5068 ) * (-i) * fm ≈ (1.973) * (-i) fm → -1.973 i fm.

So, Im(f) = sum * (1/(2i k)) → sum is 9.1023, so:

Im(f) = 9.1023 * ( -1.973 i fm ) * (1/(2i k)) ?

Wait, no, I think I got confused. Let me re-express.

Im(f) = [ sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * [ 1/(2i k) ]

We have sum = 9.1023, and 1/(2i k) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (1/(2i)) * (3.947 fm).

Because 1/k is 1/0.2534 ≈3.947 fm.

So, 1/(2i k) = (1/(2i)) * 3.947 fm.

1/(2i) is -i/2. So,

1/(2i k) = (-i/2) * 3.947 fm = (-i * 3.947 )/(2) fm ≈ (-i * 1.9735) fm.

Now, Im(f) = 9.1023 * (-i * 1.9735) fm.

Wait, but that would give a complex number. However, the imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i. So, the imaginary part is (sum) * (1/(2i k)) → but wait, wait, the formula for Im(f) is (sum) * (1/(2i k)), which is [sum * 1/(2ik)].

But let's compute this:

sum =9.1023.

So,

Im(f) = (9.1023) * [1/(2ik) ]

Which is (9.1023) * (1/(2ik)).

But 2ik = 2i * 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So,

1/(2ik) = 1/(2i * 0.2534 fm^{-1}) ) = 1/(0.5068 i fm^{-1} ) = (1/0.5068 ) * (1/(i fm^{-1}) ) ) → which is (1.973) * ( -i fm ).

Because 1/(i) = -i.

So,

1/(2ik) = (1.973) * (-i fm ).

Thus,

Im(f) = 9.1023 * (1.973) * (-i fm )

But wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think differently.

I think the confusion arises because I'm mixing up the steps. Let me write the formula again.

Im(f) = [ sum_{l} (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] * [ 1/(2ik) ]

We have sum ≈9.1023.

k ≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f) = 9.1023 * [ 1/(2i * 0.2534 fm^{-1}) ]

Compute denominator: 2i *0.2534 = 0.5068 i fm^{-1}.

So,

1/(0.5068 i fm^{-1}) ) = (1/0.5068) * (1/(i fm^{-1}) ) = 1.973 * (1/(i fm^{-1}) )

But 1/(i) = -i, and 1/(fm^{-1}) is fm.

So,

1/(0.5068 i fm^{-1}) ) = 1.973 * (-i) * fm.

So,

Im(f) =9.1023 * (1.973) * (-i) fm.

But wait, the formula is [sum] * [1/(2ik)].

Hmm, but wait, the factor 1/(2ik) is already including the i. So, when I compute Im(f), it's the imaginary part of the whole term.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the term and take the imaginary part.

Let me re-express 1/(2ik) as (1/(2i)) * (1/k).

We have 1/(2i) = -i/2.

So, 1/(2ik) = (-i/2) * (1/k).

1/k is 3.947 fm.

So,

1/(2ik) = (-i/2) * 3.947 fm = (-i * 1.9735 ) fm.

Now, Im(f) = sum * (1/(2ik) ) = 9.1023 * (-i *1.9735 fm )

But wait, that's a complex number. The imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i multiplied by fm.

So,

Im(f) = 9.1023 * (-i) *1.9735 fm = (-i) * (9.1023 * 1.9735) fm.

The value inside the imaginary part would be the coefficient of i. So,

Im(f) = - (9.1023 * 1.9735) fm.

Wait, but wait, the factor of i is multiplied by a real number, so the imaginary part is that real number multiplied by -1.

Wait, let's calculate 9.1023 *1.9735.

Let me compute that:

9 * 1.9735 = 17.7615.

0.1023 *1.9735 ≈ 0.2016.

So, sum is approximately 17.7615 + 0.2016 = 17.9631.

So, Im(f) ≈ -17.9631 fm.

Wait, but this gives a negative value. How can the imaginary part be negative? Because the phase shifts are positive, but perhaps the formula has a negative.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula for f is sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ) / (2ik).

So, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

Then, e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So, when taking the imaginary part of each term, it's (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l * P_l(cosθ) / (2ik).

So, the imaginary part of f is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * P_l(cosθ) * [ 1/(2ik) ].

But P_l(1) is 1 for each l, so the sum is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Thus, Im(f) = [sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * [1/(2i k)].

So, the [1/(2i k)] term is (1/(2ik)).

I think my prior calculation is correct, but perhaps I should consider the modulus in terms of magnitude and direction. But the question is simply asking for the imaginary part, so the sign would matter in that sense.

But in the options, all the options are positive numbers. So perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the formula. Let me check.

In scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ) e^{i (l) φ}.

But when θ is zero, cosθ is 1, and φ is zero (along the beam direction), so e^{i l φ} = 1.

So, the formula becomes f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Which can be broken into real and imaginary parts.

Each term is (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ) .

So, the real part is (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l / (2ik) times 1/(2ik) ?

Wait, no, the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of terms. So, each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So, the sum is (sum real parts) + i (sum imaginary parts).

So, the imaginary part of f is [sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * (1/(2ik)).

Wait, but 1/(2ik) is a complex number. So, let me compute this as a real number multiplied by 1/(2ik).

Hmm, perhaps I should express 1/(2ik) in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Wait, 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) → which is (1/(2i)) * (3.947 fm) as earlier.

But 1/(2i) = -i/(2), so 1/(2ik) = (-i/2) * 3.947 fm = (-i * 1.9735) fm.

So, when I multiply this by the sum (9.1023), I get:

Im(f) = 9.1023 * (-i * 1.9735) fm = (-i) * (9.1023 * 1.9735) fm ≈ (-i) * 17.963 fm.

So, the imaginary part is Im(f) = -17.963 fm.

But the options are all positive. So I must have missed a sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude has a positive in front. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of f is the coefficient of i, so in the expression, Im(f) = [sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * [1/(2ik)].

But [1/(2ik)] is a complex number. Let me represent it as a + ib.

Wait, 1/(2ik) = [1/(2i)] * [1/k]. Let me compute 1/(2i) = -i/2.

So,

1/(2ik) = (-i/2) * (1/k) = (-i/2) * (3.947 fm) ≈ (-i * 1.9735) fm.

So, when we multiply this by sum (9.1023), we get:

Im(f) = 9.1023 * (-i * 1.9735) fm = (-i) * (9.1023 *1.9735) fm.

Thus, the imaginary part is - 17.963 fm.

But the options are positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the absolute value, or perhaps I missed a negative sign in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/(2ik)) * sum ... which would make the imaginary part positive if the sum is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when calculating 1/(2ik). Let's check:

k is a real positive number, so 2ik is a purely imaginary number with positive sign if k is positive.

So, 1/(2ik) is 1/(i (2k)) = -i/(2k).

So, 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So, when I multiply the sum (9.1023) by (-i/(2k)), I get:

9.1023 * (-i/(2k)) = 9.1023 * (-i) * (1/(2k)).

So, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. Let me compute the coefficient:

9.1023 * (-1/(2k)).

Because when you multiply -i by a real number, the coefficient of i is the real number.

So, the imaginary part is Im(f) = - (9.1023)/(2k) * (1).

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think of Im(f) as the imaginary part of the expression. So, the expression is sum * [1/(2ik) ].

sum is a real number, 9.1023.

So, 9.1023 * [1/(2ik) ] = 9.1023 * [ (-i) / (2k) ) ].

Which equals (9.1023) * (-i) / (2k).

So, this is a purely imaginary number with coefficient (9.1023)/(2k) ) * (-1).

So, Im(f) = - (9.1023)/(2k) fm.

Because 1/k is 3.947 fm.

So,

Im(f) = - (9.1023) * (3.947 ) / (2) fm → let's compute that.

9.1023 *3.947 ≈ let's calculate:

9 *3.947 = 35.523,

0.1023 *3.947 ≈0.404.

Total ≈35.523 +0.404 =35.927.

Divide by 2: 35.927 / 2 ≈17.9635.

So, Im(f) = -17.9635 fm.

But the options are positive, so perhaps I have a sign error.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is positive because the sum is positive and the (1/(2ik)) term is negative imaginary. So, the imaginary part would be negative.

But the options are all positive. Hmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_l, and the formula for f is correct, but perhaps I should take the absolute value of the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is just the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l times [1/(2k)].

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The formula for f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Each e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l is cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So, the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So, when we sum these and multiply by 1/(2ik), which is a complex number, the imaginary part of f is sum * [1/(2ik)].

But 1/(2ik) is a complex number. So, the imaginary part of f is sum * [Im(1/(2ik)) ].

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Im(f) = [sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * Im(1/(2ik)).

Wait, but 1/(2ik) is a purely imaginary number. So, 1/(2ik) = i * (-1/(2k)).

Because 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/2) * (1/k) = (-i) * (1/(2k)).

So, the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is - (1/(2k)).

So, when I multiply sum (9.1023) by 1/(2ik), the imaginary part is 9.1023 * (-1/(2k)).

So, Im(f) =9.1023 * (-1/(2k)).

Which is negative, but the options are positive, so perhaps the correct answer is the absolute value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when I set up the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ) * (1/(2k)).

Because when you have a term like (1/(2ik)) = -i/(2k), then the imaginary part of that term is ( -1/(2k) ), so when you multiply by the sum (which is real), the imaginary part is sum * ( -1/(2k) ).

But the options are positive, so perhaps the correct answer is positive, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is sum times (1/(2k)), without the negative sign. Let me think about this.

Wait, let's recompute 1/(2ik) properly.

1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k).

But 1/(2i) = -i/(2).

So,

1/(2ik) = (-i/(2)) * (3.947 fm).

So, this is a purely imaginary number: -i * 1.9735 fm.

So, when I multiply this by sum (9.1023), which is real, I get:

9.1023 * (-i * 1.9735 fm) = (-i) * (9.1023 *1.9735) fm.

Which is a complex number with zero real part and imaginary part of -17.963 fm.

But the problem asks for the imaginary part of f, which in this case is -17.963 fm. However, all the options are positive.

Ah, but wait, perhaps the formula has a different sign. Let me think again.

In the expression for f, it's (1/(2ik)) times the sum of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

But wait, perhaps the formula is actually (1/(2ik)) times the sum, which is the sum of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So, the imaginary part of that term would be the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So, the overall imaginary part is (sum) * [1/(2ik)].

But [1/(2ik)] is a complex number with negative imaginary part.

So, when I multiply the sum (real) by [1/(2ik)] (complex), the result is a complex number, and its imaginary part is sum * [Im(1/(2ik))].

Im(1/(2ik)) is the imaginary part of 1/(2ik), which is -1/(2k).

So, Im(f) = sum * (-1/(2k)).

Which is sum * ( -1/(2k) ), which is negative. But the options are positive, so perhaps the correct answer is the magnitude, which is sum/(2k) ≈17.963 fm.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm confusing the sign. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute the magnitude of the imaginary part, so the answer would be approximately 17.963 fm.

But looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm. Wait, that's much bigger than my calculation.

Wait, something's wrong here. Let me recheck the k calculation.

Wait, earlier I calculated k as approximately 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me recompute k.

k = p/(ħ c).

p is 49.9974 MeV/c.

ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k = (49.9974 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = (49.9974 / 197.33) (1/(fm)).

Calculating 49.9974 / 197.33:

49.9974 ÷ 197.33 ≈ 0.2534.

So, k ≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈3.947 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/(2k) as 1/(2 * 0.2534) ) = 1/(0.5068) ≈1.973 fm.

So, 1/(2k) =1.973 fm.

Wait, but in the formula for Im(f), I have Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * (1/(2ik)).

Which is sum * [1/(2ik)].

But 1/(2ik) is equal to (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/2) * (3.947 fm) ≈ (-i) * 1.9735 fm.

So,

Im(f) = 9.1023 * (-i * 1.9735) fm = (-i) * (17.963) fm.

So, the imaginary part is -17.963 fm. But since the question asks for the imaginary part, which is a real number, perhaps it's the magnitude they're after, so 17.963 fm. But none of the options match this. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, none of these are near 17.96 fm. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Because earlier I used p = (50 MeV/c) approximately, but perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Wait, let's compute p accurately.

E is the total energy, which is K + m c². If the 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, then E = 50 + 0.511 =50.511 MeV.

So,

p = sqrt( (E/(c))^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c.

Wait, no, the units are a bit messy. Let me compute p in MeV/c.

E² = (p c )² + (m c² )^2.

So,

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c² )^2 ).

Thus,

p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c² )^2 ) ) / c^2.

But perhaps it's better to compute in units where c=1.

So, E in MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So,

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c² )^2 ) = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(50^2 + 2*50*0.511 + ... - 0.261) → but perhaps a better approach is to compute it numerically.

E =50.511 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

So,

E² = (50.511)^2 = 2551.53 (MeV)^2.

(m c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So,

(p c )² = 2551.53 - 0.261 = 2551.269.

p c = sqrt(2551.269 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

Wait, that can't be right because then p=50.511 MeV/c.

Wait, but that would make p≈50.511 MeV/c.

Wait, so k = p/(ħ c) = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 50.511 / 197.33 ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈3.907 fm.

So, 1/(2ik) = (-i/(2)) * (3.907 fm) → (-i) * 1.9535 fm.

So, Im(f) = sum * (-i) *1.9535 fm.

Sum is 9.1023.

So, Im(f) = 9.1023 * (-i) *1.9535 fm → which is (-i) * (9.1023 *1.9535) fm.

Compute 9.1023 *1.9535 ≈17.83 fm.

So, Im(f) = -17.83 fm.

Again, none of the options are near this. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Because in scattering theory, phase shifts are usually in radians. Did I forget to convert degrees to radians?

But the question gives phase shifts in degrees: 90°, 67°, etc. So perhaps I should have converted them to radians before computing sin(δ_l).

Wait, that's a crucial point! Because if I used degrees instead of radians, the sine function would have given incorrect values.

Oh no! That's probably where I went wrong.

So, let me correct that.

I should convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin(δ_l).

So, let's redo the (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l terms with δ_l in radians.

Compute each δ_l in radians:

δ₀=90° = π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

δ₁=67° → 67 * (π/180) ≈1.16937 rad.

δ₂=55° →55*(π/180)= ~0.95993 rad.

δ₃=30° →30*(π/180)=0.523599 rad.

δ₄=13° →13*(π/180)=~0.226893 rad.

Now, compute (2l+1) sin² δ_l for each l.

l=0: (2*0+1) =1. sin(1.5708) =1. So sin^2=1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: 3. sin(1.16937). Let me compute sin(1.16937) ≈ sin(67°) ≈0.9205, but wait, in radians, let me compute accurately.

Using calculator: sin(1.16937) ≈0.9205.

So sin² ≈0.8473. Term: 3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2: 5. sin(0.95993) → sin(55°)=approx 0.8192. So sin^2≈0.6710. Term:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7. sin(0.523599)=sin(30°)=0.5. sin^2=0.25. Term:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9. sin(0.226893)=sin(13°)≈0.2249. sin²≈0.0506. Term:9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

So the same sum as before: 1 +2.5419 +3.355 +1.75 +0.4554=9.1023.

Hmm, same sum. So why did I get the same sum? Because the sin values are the same whether I compute in degrees or radians? No, that's not correct. Wait, wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, because when I compute sin(1.5708 radians), it's 90 degrees, so correct.

Wait, but when I compute sin(67 degrees), I did it correctly in radians as well. So, the sum remains the same.

Wait, so the sum is the same, so the same problem arises.

Wait, but the options don't match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the k was computed as 0.2534 fm^{-1}, but perhaps I should have used the relativistic relation for k.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f includes an additional factor.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum correctly, but I'm not getting any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2, or maybe I should multiply by the sum, but perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (P_l(cosθ)) / (2ik) e^{i l φ}.

Wait, no, that's a different form. The standard form is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion, where the amplitude is f = sum ( (2l+1) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ) / (2ik) P_l (cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me look up the standard expression.

Ah, right, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

So, when θ=0 and φ=0, it's f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Which is what I used earlier.

Hmm. So, perhaps I'm correct with my earlier calculations, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absolute value of the imaginary part, but the options are way larger.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but when I computed the sum, I should have used them in radians, but I didn't, which would change the sin^2 values. Let me recompute the sum with δ_l in radians.

Wait, but earlier I did compute them in radians, and the sum was the same as when using degrees because the sin values were the same.

Wait, that can't be. Because when I compute sin(67 degrees) in radians, it's the same as sin(67°). So, the sum would be the same.

Hmm. So, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the formula.

Wait, some sources define the scattering amplitude as (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, others might have a different factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is sum * (1/(2k)) ) because (1/(2ik)) = (1/(2k)) ) * (-i), and the imaginary part would be sum * ( -1/(2k) ).

Wait, so Im(f) = sum * ( -1/(2k) ).

But if I take the magnitude, it's sum/(2k).

In our case, sum=9.1023, 1/(2k)=1/(2 *0.2534 )=1.973 fm.

So, sum/(2k) =9.1023 *1.973 ≈17.963 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let's recompute k accurately.

E is 50 MeV (assuming kinetic energy), so E =50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50.511^2 - 0.511^2 ) = sqrt(2551.530 -0.261)= sqrt(2551.269)=50.511 MeV.

So, p= (50.511 MeV ) / c.

Thus,

k = p/(ħ c) = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) =50.511/(197.33 ) fm^{-1} ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈3.907 fm.

So, 1/(2k )= 3.907/2 ≈1.9535 fm.

So, sum=9.1023.

Im(f)= sum * ( -1/(2k ) )= 9.1023*(-1.9535) ≈-17.83 fm.

Again, the same as before, but the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f). Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is sum * [1/(k)], not [1/(2k)].

What if I made a mistake in the initial formula and the factor is 1/k instead of 1/(2k)?

In that case, sum=9.1023,

1/k ≈3.907 fm.

Im(f)= sum * (1/k) * ( -1/(2i) ).

Wait, but no, the formula is 1/(2ik), which includes the 2.

Wait, perhaps I should not include the (1/(2i)) factor in the calculation of the imaginary part. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum * (1/(2k) ) * (1).

Because the imaginary part of (1/(2ik)) is ( -1/(2k) ), so Im(f)= sum * ( -1/(2k) ).

But perhaps the question is only interested in the magnitude, so 17.83 fm, which is not matching any options.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55, δ₃=30, δ₄=13.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units where they're already in the formula as e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, no, the formula uses the actual phase shifts.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum * (1/k ), without the 1/2 factor.

In that case,

Im(f)= sum (9.1023) * (1/k ) =9.1023 *3.907 fm ≈35.55 fm.

But 35.55 is close to option B:355.351 fm. But it's an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recompute k.

k = p/(ħ c).

p c =50.511 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, p=50.511 MeV/c.

k= (50.511 MeV/c )/(197.33 MeV fm) )= 50.511/(197.33 ) fm^{-1} ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k=3.907 fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use 1/(k) multiplied by sum.

So, Im(f)= sum * (1/(2i) * (1/k) )).

But 1/(2i) is -i/2, so Im(f)= sum * ( -i/(2k) ).

So, the imaginary part is sum * (-1/(2k) ), which is - sum/(2k) = -9.1023/(2*0.256) ≈-17.83 fm.

But the options are way larger. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation of the sum is incorrect because the phase shifts are in degrees, but I should have converted them to radians before taking sine.

Wait, let me compute sin^2(δ_l) again, but this time δ_l in radians.

Compute each δ_l in radians:

δ₀=90°=1.5708 rad. sin(1.5708)=1, so sin^2=1. Term=1.

δ₁=67°=1.16937 rad. sin(1.16937)= ~0.9205, sin²=0.8473. Term=3*0.8473=2.5419.

δ₂=55°=0.95993 rad. sin=0.8192, sin²=0.6710. Term=5*0.6710=3.355.

δ₃=30°=0.523599 rad. sin=0.5, sin²=0.25. Term=7*0.25=1.75.

δ₄=13°=0.226893 rad. sin=0.2249, sin²=0.0506. Term=9*0.0506=0.4554.

Sum=1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554=9.1023.

Same as before. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum, but the sum is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) instead of sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, that might change things. Let me think.

No, the formula uses e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, which expands to cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l. So, the imaginary part should be (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Hmm. I'm stuck. My calculation doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 fm is exactly 10 times 17.7675 fm.

Wait, earlier I found Im(f)≈-17.963 fm. So, 17.963 *10 is approximately 179.63 fm, which is close to option C:177.675 fm.

But why would I have a factor of 10 error? Did I forget to convert from fm to another unit?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

E=50 MeV.

But wait, if the 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, E=K + m c^2=50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

Then,

p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) =50.511 MeV.

So, p=50.511 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ c) = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) )=50.511/197.33 fm^{-1}=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k≈3.907 fm.

So, sum=9.1023.

So, Im(f)= sum * (1/(2ik))= sum * (-i/(2k) )=9.1023 * (-i) * (1/(2*0.256) ) fm.

1/(2*0.256)=1/0.512≈1.9531.

So,

Im(f)=9.1023 * (-i) *1.9531 fm= (-i) *17.83 fm.

So, the imaginary part is -17.83 fm. But none of the options are close.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So, the imaginary part is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/(2ik) ).

But perhaps I should calculate the absolute value of the imaginary part, which would be sum * (1/(2k) ), because 1/(2ik) has a magnitude of 1/(2k).

So,

Im(f)= sum * (1/(2k) ) =9.1023/(2*0.256) →9.1023/(0.512)≈17.767 fm.

Which is approximately 17.77 fm. But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for ħ c.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

But sometimes it's written as 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, when I compute k = p/(ħ c), p is in MeV/c, ħ c is in MeV·fm.

So, units: (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = (1/(c·fm)).

But c is in m/s, so 1/(c·fm) is in s/m.

But when we compute k, it should have units of fm^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in unit conversion, leading to the value being off by a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct value of ħc is 197.33 MeV·fm, so when I compute k, it's (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm) )=50/(197.33) fm^{-1}.

Which is approximately 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k=3.947 fm.

So, sum=9.1023.

Im(f)= sum/(2k) )=9.1023/(2*0.2534) )=9.1023/(0.5068 )≈17.963 fm.

But the options don't have this value.

Wait, perhaps the initial formula for the scattering amplitude has a factor of 1/(2ik) × something, and I missed a factor of 10^23 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation involves the Born approximation, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, and the formula requires them in radians, which would change the sin^2 values.

Wait, but earlier I computed the sum using degrees, and it was the same as when using radians. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. For example, it's (sum ...) / (2ik) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum × (1/k) × (1/(2i)).

But that brings us back to the same place.

Hmm. I'm stuck. My calculation doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) multiplied by something.

Wait, no, because the formula uses e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, which expands to cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l multiplied by (1/(2ik) ), which is a complex number.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l multiplied by (1/(2k) ), which would be sum/(2k).

So, Im(f)= sum/(2k) )=9.1023/(2*0.2534 )=9.1023/0.5068≈17.963 fm.

But as the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as (p)/ (ħ c) where p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm. So,

p=50 MeV/c.

So,

k=50/(197.33 ) fm^{-1}≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k=3.947 fm.

So, sum=9.1023.

Im(f)= sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2*0.2534 )=17.963 fm.

None of the options match. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but this can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is not just the sum, but multiplied by another factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) multiplied by (1/(2ik) ).

Wait, but that would be different.

Wait, e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l= [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] * sin δ_l= cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So, the imaginary part is sin^2 δ_l.

So, the sum is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll go with the calculation I did and see if any option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift values. Let me recalculate the sum.

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90)=1 →1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13)=9*(0.2249)^2=9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum=1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but more likely, I made a mistake in the k calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy used to compute k is 50 MeV, not 50.511 MeV.

If E=50 MeV, then p c = sqrt(50^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈49.9974 MeV.

So,

p=49.9974 MeV/c.

k=49.9974/(197.33 ) fm^{-1}≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k=3.947 fm.

Im(f)= sum/(2k )=9.1023/(2*0.2534 )=17.963 fm.

Still no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f is f= sum ... multiplied by something else, like (1/k) instead of (1/(2ik)).

If that's the case, Im(f)= sum * (1/(ik) ) → Im(f) would be sum * (1/k) * ( -1/i )= sum * (1/k) * i → which would make Im(f)= sum * (1/k) * i, but that doesn't make sense because Im(f) should be real.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The sum is 9.1023, and 1/k is about 3.947 fm.

So, 9.1023 *3.947 ≈35.927 fm.

Which is close to option B:355.351 fm. But 35.927 is 35.9, and option B is 355, which is a factor of 10 higher.

Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied by 10, but why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for ħc. Let's think:

ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

But maybe I should use ħc=197.33 ×10^{-13} cm·MeV.

Wait, no, because the unit fm is 1e-15 m, which is 1e-13 cm. So, 1 fm =1e-13 cm.

Wait, but how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, when I compute k = p/(ħ c ), p is in MeV/c, ħc is in MeV·fm.

So, k has units of (MeV/c ) / (MeV·fm ) → (1/(c·fm)).

But the speed of light c is in cm/s, so 1/(c·fm) would be in s/(cm·fm).

But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation. Perhaps I should double-check the unit conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in units where ħc =197.33 MeV·fm, and p is in MeV/c.

So, p =50 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħc )=50/(197.33 ) fm^{-1}≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Which is correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but given the options, the closest would be option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger than my calculation.

But I can't see where I would have a factor of 10 error. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the phase shifts are in units of π radians instead of degrees, but that would change the sin^2 values significantly.

Wait, for example, if δ_l=90 degrees= π/2 radians, but if someone treats it as 90 radians, which is impossible. But that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of 10 degrees, but that's not indicated.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll go with the calculation I did and assume that the intended answer is approximately 17.96 fm, but since that's not an option, I'm probably missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l multiplied by (1/(k) ), not (1/(2k) ).

So, Im(f)= sum/(k )=9.1023/(0.2534 )≈35.927 fm.

Which is approximately 35.93 fm. Closest option is B:355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger.

But why would I have a factor of 10 error? Perhaps a miscalculation in k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting MeV to other units. Let me think: 1 eV=1.6e-19 joules. But perhaps this isn't relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the total energy E=50 MeV without adding the rest mass, which would give p=50 MeV/c.

So,

k=50/(197.33 )≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Sum=9.1023.

Im(f)= sum/(2k)=9.1023/(2*0.2534 )=17.963 fm.

Still no match.

Well, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 10 times 17.7675 fm, but I can't see where I would have a factor of 10 error.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 1000 somewhere, leading to 17.963 *1000=17963 fm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e5 and 1e2 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, perhaps I should have used 50 MeV for the total energy, not the kinetic energy, which would give p=50 MeV/c.

But even then, it wouldn't change the sum much.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The closest I can get is 17.963 fm, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, assuming I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic electron scattering using the given phase shifts and the energy of the electrons. The scattering amplitude is expressed as:

\[
f(\theta, \phi) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l P_l(\cos\theta) e^{i l \phi},
\]

where \(P_l(\cos\theta)\) are Legendre polynomials, and the imaginary part of \(f\) is determined by the terms involving \(\sin^2\delta_l\). The problem specifies \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ\), and the energy of the electrons is \(50~\text{MeV}\). The calculation proceeds as follows:

1. **Phase Shifts and \(\sin^2\delta_l\):**  
   The phase shifts are converted to radians (though the sine values remain consistent in both units). The \(\sin^2\delta_l\) values are computed for each \(l\):
   - \(l=0\): \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\sin^2\delta_0 = 1\), term = \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
   - \(l=1\): \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\sin^2\delta_1 \approx 0.8473\), term = \(3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419\).
   - \(l=2\): \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\sin^2\delta_2 \approx 0.6710\), term = \(5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355\).
   - \(l=3\): \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), \(\sin^2\delta_3 = 0.25\), term = \(7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\).
   - \(l=4\): \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\), \(\sin^2\delta_4 \approx 0.0506\), term = \(9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554\).

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   \text{Total sum} = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
   \]

2. **Wave Number \(k\):**  
   The wave number \(k\) is calculated using the relativistic relation \(k = \frac{p}{\hbar c}\), where \(p = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}/c\). For \(E = 50~\text{MeV}\) (assuming \(E\) is the total energy), \(m c^2 = 0.511~\text{MeV}\), and \(\hbar c \approx 197.33~\text{MeV·fm}\):
   \[
   p = \sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2} \approx 50~\text{MeV}/c, \quad k = \frac{p}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.2534~\text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

3. **Imaginary Part of \(f\):**  
   The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f) = \frac{\text{sum}}{2k}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\text{sum} \approx 9.1023\) and \(k \approx 0.2534~\text{fm}^{-1}\):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f) = \frac{9.1023}{2 \cdot 0.2534} \approx 17.963~\text{fm}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The calculated value of \(\text{Im}(f) \approx 17.963~\text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \(C\) (\(177.675~\text{fm}\)) is approximately \(10 \times 17.963~\text{fm}\). This discrepancy suggests a possible factor of \(10\) error in the problem setup or interpretation, though the exact source is unclear.

Given the available options and the closest match to the calculated value, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
