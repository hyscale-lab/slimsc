Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how they mimic exoplanet signals. Interesting. I remember that starspots can cause brightness variations that resemble a planet passing in front of the star. So the question is asking about the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness change as these spots.

Alright, let's parse the problem. The star has the same radius as the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%, which is 0.2. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler (since they're dark) with a 1000 K difference. Oh wait, the spots are Teff - 1000 K, so 5000 K? Or maybe the other way around? Wait, no, the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So spots are either 5000K or 7000K? No, since spots are cooler, I think theyâ€™re 5000K.

But wait, when you have spots, they're darker, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But how does that affect the observed brightness? The brightness variation comes from the difference in brightness between the spotted and unspotted areas as the star rotates.

I think when a spot is in front of the star (from our point of view), it blocks some of the light. But the area blocked depends on the spot's size and the star's surface. The same goes for a planet transiting the star.

So the problem is about comparing the light curve amplitude caused by the spots to that caused by a planet. The goal is to find R_planet / R_star such that the amplitude is the same as the spots.

Wait, so normally, the change in brightness when a planet transits is (R_planet / R_star)^2 times the star's brightness, right? Because the area blocked is (pi R_planet^2) / (pi R_star^2) = (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But in this case, the star isn't just having a planet block a part of it, but the star itself has spots that cause the same apparent brightness change.

So I need to calculate the amplitude caused by the spots. The amplitude is the difference in brightness when the spot is visible versus when it's not. So when the spot is on the side rotating towards us, it's covering a part of the star, but since it's cooler, it's emitting less light. So the total brightness would decrease when the spot is in view.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view as it spins. The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the star covered by spots on one hemisphere is 0.2 times the area of that hemisphere. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, perhaps the maximum coverage is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area covered is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Since the star is a sphere, the hemisphere area is 2 pi R^2. So the spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

But when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots are visible. Wait, no, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, we see from Earth either that hemisphere or the other. Wait, no, because if the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere, then as it turns, that hemisphere comes into view. So the spots are on the near side, so when the star rotates such that the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible.

Wait, but the rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view as the star spins. So the maximum effect would be when the entire spot area is visible. So the variation in brightness would be the difference between the normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are covering part of the star's disk.

Wait, but wait, the star is emitting light. The spots are cooler, so they emit less. So when the spots are in view, the total flux is less. The star's total flux without spots would be F = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (distance^2). Wait, but we can consider the flux from the star as a function of time, and the spot coverage affects that.

So when the spot is in front, the flux is F = F_star * (1 - (f * A_spot / A_star)) ), where f is the filling factor, A_spot is the area of the spots, and A_star is the area of the star.

Wait, no, the filling factor is already the fraction of the area covered by spots on the hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute (1 - f) * (area of hemisphere) + f * area of spots at lower temperature. Wait, maybe I should model the flux variation.

The star's total flux when spots are on the hemisphere (facing us) would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

So the star's total flux when the spot hemisphere is facing us is:

F = F_unspotted_hemisphere + F_spotted_hemisphere.

F_unspotted_hemisphere is (1 - f) * (sigma * Teff^4) * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) )? Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of per unit area.

Wait, the star emits a certain amount of flux. The unspotted area emits at Teff, the spotted area at a lower temperature. So the total flux when the spot hemisphere is facing us is:

F_total = ( (1 - f) * (sigma * Teff^4) * (2 pi R^2) ) + ( f * (sigma * (Teff - delta T)^4 ) * (2 pi R^2) ) ) / (4 pi D^2) )

But when the star's unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_total = (sigma * Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the relative change in flux when the spot hemisphere is visible.

So the maximum effect (the dip) occurs when the spot hemisphere is fully visible. So the flux when the spots are visible is:

F_spotted = F_unspotted - (f * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) )

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The star's total flux is F = sigma Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

When a spot is present, some part of the star's surface emits less. The unspotted area of the hemisphere would be (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2. The spotted area is f * 2 pi R^2.

So the flux from the spot hemisphere when it's visible is:

F_hemisphere = [ (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 + f * sigma (Teff - delta T)^4 ) ] * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) )

Wait, but the entire star's flux is F = sigma Teff^4 (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

When the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_hemisphere = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) )

So the total flux is F = F_hemisphere + F_other_hemisphere.

But F_other_hemisphere is the flux from the other hemisphere, which is unspotted. So it's F_other = sigma Teff^4 (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) )

So F_total when the spot hemisphere is visible is:

F_total = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) + [ Teff^4 * 2 pi R^2 / (4 pi D^2) ) ]

Simplify that:

F_total = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 + Teff^4 ] * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 ) )

Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted. So, the other hemisphere's flux is sigma Teff^4 (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ), which is the same as (2 pi R^2 / 4 pi D^2 ) * sigma Teff^4.

So F_total = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * (2 pi R^2)/(4 pi D^2) ) + [ Teff^4 * (2 pi R^2) ) / (4 pi D^2) ) ]

Let me compute each part.

First, let me compute the spot hemisphere's contribution:

Spot_hemi = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * (R^2) / (2 D^2 )

The other hemisphere is:

Other_hemi = Teff^4 * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

= Teff^4 * R^2 / (2 D^2 )

So F_total = Spot_hemi + Other_hemi

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 + Teff^4 ] * R^2/(2 D^2 )

= [ (1 - f + f ) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * R^2/(2 D^2 )

= [ Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 - f Teff^4 ] * R^2/(2 D^2 )

= [ Teff^4 (1 - f) + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * R^2/(2 D^2 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the relative change in flux.

The normal flux is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

When the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = F0 * [ ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ) * (2 pi R^2) + (2 pi R^2) Teff^4 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 )

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. The flux without any spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2 / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 * [ ( (1-f) * ( (Teff^4) / Teff^4 ) ) + f * ( (Teff - delta T)^4 / Teff^4 ) ) ] * ( area fraction )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The relative flux change is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, when the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower because the spots are cooler. The change in flux is:

Delta F = F0 - F_spotted.

Wait, no, because F_spotted is less than F0, so the change would be negative, but the magnitude is what matters for the amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is the maximum dip in flux.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

But F_spotted is the flux when the spot hemisphere is visible, which we have to calculate.

Wait, F_spotted is the flux when the spot hemisphere is in view. The spot hemisphere has some areas at lower temperature.

So the flux from the spot hemisphere is:

F_spotted_hemi = ( (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 + f * sigma (Teff - delta T)^4 ) * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

The other hemisphere is unspotted, so its flux is:

F_other_hemi = sigma Teff^4 * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

So total flux when spot hemisphere is visible:

F_total = F_spotted_hemi + F_other_hemi

= [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 + Teff^4 ] * sigma (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

Simplify the numerator:

= [ (1 - f + 1) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ (2 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of F0.

F0 = sigma Teff^4 (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So the term (sigma (2 pi R^2) )/(4 pi D^2 ) ) is (sigma R^2 )/(2 D^2) ) * (2 pi / 4 pi ) ) = (sigma R^2)/(2 D^2) ) * (1/2) )= sigma R^2 / (4 D^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction.

The fraction of the flux when the spot hemisphere is visible compared to F0 is:

F_total / F0 = [ ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ) * (2 pi R^2) + (2 pi R^2) Teff^4 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 ) )

Wait, no, perhaps let me compute F_total and F0.

F_total = [ ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) * (2 pi R^2) + Teff^4 (2 pi R^2) ) ] * sigma / (4 pi D^2 )

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me re-express.

Alternatively, think about the area of the star. The total area is 4 pi R^2. The spot hemisphere is 2 pi R^2, and the other hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. The spots cover f * 2 pi R^2.

So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F = (area of unspotted part of hemisphere * Teff^4 + area of spotted part of hemisphere * (Teff - delta_T)^4) * sigma / (4 pi D^2 )

Which is:

F = [ (2 pi R^2 (1 - f)) * Teff^4 + (2 pi R^2 f) (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma / (4 pi D^2 )

Divide numerator and denominator by 2 pi R^2 sigma:

F = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta T)^4 ] * (2 pi R^2 sigma) / (4 pi D^2 )

Wait, maybe I should factor out R^2 sigma in the numerator.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute F_total as a fraction of F0.

F0 = sigma Teff^4 (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

F_total = [ ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) * 2 pi R^2 + (2 pi R^2 Teff^4 ) ] * sigma / (4 pi D^2 )

Wait, no. When the spot hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere is not, so perhaps I should correct that. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model F as the sum of the contributions from each hemisphere.

Wait, sorry, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

The star has an effective temperature of 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so 5000 K.

When the star is viewed such that the spot hemisphere is visible, the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The unspotted part of the spot hemisphere is (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2, and each unit area emits sigma Teff^4.

The spotted part is f * 2 pi R^2, each unit area emits sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4.

The other hemisphere (non-spotty) is 2 pi R^2, each unit area emits sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no, when the spot hemisphere is in view, the other hemisphere is not. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is on the back side and not visible. So the visible area is the spot hemisphere.

Wait, no, I'm confused. When you look at a sphere, you can only see one hemisphere at a time. The other hemisphere is not visible because it's on the far side. So when the spot hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is not visible, but wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So the other hemisphere is spot-free.

Wait, no, the star has one hemisphere with spots and the other hemisphere without. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, we don't.

So, the flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted = [ (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 + f * sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) ] * (2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi D^2 )

Because the visible area is 2 pi R^2.

Alternatively, the flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is:

F = ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) * (sigma 2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi D^2 )

Which can be written as:

F = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (sigma R^2 ) (2 pi) / (4 pi D^2 )

Simplify:

F = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (sigma R^2 )/(2 D^2 )

But F0, the normal flux, is sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So the ratio F / F0 is:

[ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / ( 2 Teff^4 )

Because F0 = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) / Teff^4 ] / 2

But wait, let me compute the ratio correctly.

Wait,

F = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (sigma R^2 )/(2 D^2 )

F0 = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So F / F0 = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (sigma R^2 )/(2 D^2 ) / [ sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2 )

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / (2 Teff^4 )

= [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) / Teff^4 ] / 2

So the relative flux when the spots are visible is F/F0 = ( (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 / Teff^4 ) ) ) / 2.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the peak and the minimum flux. When the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is F, and when it's not, the flux is F0.

So the amplitude (delta F) is (F0 - F)/F0.

So:

Amplitude = 1 - F/F0 = 1 - [ ( (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 / Teff^4 ) ) / 2 ]

Now, plug in the numbers.

f = 0.2, Teff = 6000 K, delta_T = 1000 K.

Compute (Teff - delta_T) = 5000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) â‰ˆ 0.482253.

So,

( (1-f) + f * (5/6)^4 ) / 2 

= (0.8 + 0.2 * 0.482253 ) / 2 

= (0.8 + 0.0964506) /2

= 0.8964506 / 2 â‰ˆ 0.4482253.

So F/F0 â‰ˆ 0.4482253.

Thus, the amplitude is 1 - 0.4482253 â‰ˆ 0.5517747.

Wait, that can't be right. Because this would imply a 55% dip, which is a huge dip. But is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when the spots are visible, the flux is lower, so F < F0.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, the amplitude is (F0 - F)/F0.

So,

Amplitude = (F0 - F) / F0 = 1 - (F/F0)

From our earlier calculation, F/F0 is approximately 0.448, so 1 - 0.448 = 0.552.

So the amplitude is about 55.2% of the star's flux.

Wait, but that seems high. I thought spots would cause a smaller dip. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, so when they're visible, the flux is lower, but when the other hemisphere is visible, the flux is F0 again.

So the maximum dip is about 55%. That's a big dip, but let's proceed.

Now, the question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude when it transits the star.

The transit amplitude is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, because the area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2 of the star's area.

So the amplitude from the planet is (R_p / R_s)^2.

We need this to equal the amplitude from the spots, which is approximately 0.5517747.

Wait, but that's impossible, because (R_p / R_s)^2 can't be larger than 1, and 0.55 is larger than that, but wait, wait, no. Wait, because 0.55 is the amplitude of the dip, which is (F0 - F)/F0 = (1 - F/F0) = 0.55177.

So the planet's transit amplitude is (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.55177.

Taking square roots,

R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.55177) â‰ˆ 0.7428.

Wait, but that's larger than the star's radius, which is impossible because a planet can't be larger than the star. So something must be wrong here.

Ah, wait, wait, no. Because the star's radius is R_sun, which is about 109 times Earth's radius. So a planet with radius 0.74 R_sun would be a star-sized planet, which isn't possible. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of F/F0.

Let me go back.

F = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (sigma R^2 ) / (2 D^2 )

But F0 = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So F/F0 = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / ( 2 Teff^4 )

Which is [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff-delta_T)/Teff )^4 ] / 2.

Ah, wait, perhaps I forgot to divide by Teff^4 in that equation. Let me recompute.

Wait,

F/F0 = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / ( 2 Teff^4 )

= [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) / Teff^4 ) ] / 2.

Ah, that's correct.

So plug in the numbers:

f = 0.2,

delta_T = 1000 K,

Teff = 6000 K,

(Teff - delta_T) =5000 K,

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 â‰ˆ 0.482253.

So,

(1-f) = 0.8,

f * 0.482253 = 0.2 * 0.482253 = 0.0964506.

Sum is 0.8 + 0.0964506 = 0.8964506.

Divide by 2: 0.8964506 / 2 = 0.4482253.

So F/F0 is about 0.448.

Thus, the amplitude is 1 - 0.448 = 0.552, which is a 55% dip.

But that's impossible because the planet's transit can't cause a 55% dip in brightness unless the planet is larger than the star, which can't happen. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the spots contribute to the brightness variation. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to be only partially visible, not the entire hemisphere at once.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So when the star rotates, we see the spot hemisphere and the other hemisphere alternately.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spot hemisphere comes into view, and when it's not, the other hemisphere (without spots) is seen.

So when the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = (F0 without spots) * (1 - f) + f * (Teff - delta_T)^4 contribution.

Wait, no, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the entire spot area is in front of us. So the dip is the difference between F0 and F when the spots are all visible.

Wait, but F is the flux when the spots are visible. So the dip is F0 - F.

Wait, let me recompute the dip.

F = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) * sigma.

Wait, wait, no, because the entire star's area is 4 pi R^2. When the spot hemisphere is visible, the area is 2 pi R^2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is the sum of the unspotted part (which is (1-f) * 2 pi R^2) and the spotted part (f * 2 pi R^2) of the hemisphere.

So the flux from the spot hemisphere is:

F_spotted = (1-f) * (sigma Teff^4) * (2 pi R^2) + f * sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4 * (2 pi R^2) ) / (4 pi R^2 )

Which simplifies to:

F_spotted = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (2 pi R^2) * sigma / (4 pi R^2 )

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2 )

The 2 pi R^2 cancels with 4 pi R^2 to give 2/(4) R^2 terms:

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma (2/(4)) )

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma (1/2 )

But F0 = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about this differently.

The star's unspotted flux is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2 / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

When the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = ( (1-f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) * (2 pi R^2) sigma / (4 pi D^2 )

So,

F = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * (sigma R^2 )/(2 D^2 )

So F = F0 * [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) ] / (2 Teff^4 )

Because F0 is sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So,

F / F0 = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / (2 Teff^4 )

= [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) / Teff^4 ] / 2

Which is the same as before.

So F/F0 â‰ˆ 0.448, so amplitude is 0.552, which is a 55% dip.

But that's impossible for a planet, which can't have such a large radius. So I must have made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps I got the star's flux wrong. Because when the star is viewed, we see only the hemisphere, so the total flux in any case is (sigma Teff^4) * 2 pi R^2 / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2/(2 D^2 )

Wait, perhaps that's the correct approach.

So F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

But when the star is viewed, the flux is F = sigma Teff^4 * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2/(2 D^2 )

Wait, that can't be right because when the star is rotating, we see a hemisphere, so the flux would be F = sigma Teff^4 * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2/(2 D^2 )

But then when the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux would be:

F_spotted = (1-f) sigma Teff^4 (2 pi R^2) + f sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4 (2 pi R^2) ) / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] sigma (2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] sigma R^2 (2 pi ) / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] sigma R^2 / (2 D^2 )

But F0 when the entire star is unspotted is sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So F_spotted = F0 * [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) ] / (2 Teff^4 )

So same as before.

Thus, the amplitude is 1 - [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) / Teff^4 ] / 2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Plugging the numbers:

f=0.2,

Teff=6000,

delta_T=1000,

so (5000/6000)^4 â‰ˆ 0.482253.

So,

(1-f) = 0.8,

f * 0.482253 â‰ˆ 0.09645.

Sum: 0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645.

Divide by 2: 0.448225.

So F/F0 = 0.448225.

So the amplitude is 1 - 0.448225 â‰ˆ 0.551775, or about 55.18% dip.

But that's way too high for a planet. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem states that "the star has an effective temperature of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K." So perhaps the spots are hotter than the surrounding? No, spots are cooler, so it's 5000K.

Wait, but I'm getting a 55% dip, which is impossible for a planet. So I must have made a mistake in my model.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is not considering the entire hemisphere but only a part of it, or perhaps the calculation should be done with the planet's transit causing a dip, and the spot causing a similar dip.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on only part of the hemisphere, not the entire hemisphere when it's visible. But the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the hemisphere's area is spotted.

Wait, maybe the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is in view. So the flux dip is the area of the spots times the difference in flux per unit area.

So the flux change is:

delta F = F0 * (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Because each spot area contributes less flux.

So delta F = F0 * ( (f * 2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2) ) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

= F0 * (f / 2 ) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

So the amplitude is delta F / F0 = (f/2)(1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Wait, this seems more manageable.

So,

amplitude_spot = (f/2) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= (0.2 / 2 ) * (1 - (5^4/6^4) )

= 0.1 * (1 - (625/1296) )

625/1296 â‰ˆ 0.482253.

So,

0.1 * (1 - 0.482253 ) = 0.1 * 0.517747 â‰ˆ 0.0517747.

So amplitude_spot â‰ˆ 5.18%.

That makes more sense, because a planet's transit amplitude is much smaller.

So the planet's amplitude is (R_p / R_s )^2 = 0.0517747.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.0517747) â‰ˆ 0.2275, so about 0.227 R_s.

Wait, but wait, the star's radius is R_sun. So R_p â‰ˆ 0.227 R_sun.

But wait, the options are about 0.07, 0.11, etc. So perhaps this isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire hemisphere is spotted. So when the star rotates, the spot hemisphere comes into view, and the flux is lower.

But in my first approach, the amplitude was 55%, which is impossible for a planet. So perhaps the correct approach is the second one, considering the fractional area of the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as similar to a planet transit, so the spot's effect is similar to a planet blocking part of the star.

In that case, the amplitude from the spots would be (f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ) * (R_spot_effective / R_star )^2.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are causing a variation in the brightness as they rotate, but the total area of the spots is f * (2 pi R^2 ), since they are on a hemisphere.

So the equivalent area would be f * (2 pi R^2 ) = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

A planet of radius Rp would block an area of pi Rp^2.

The equivalent area would be when pi Rp^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So Rp^2 = 0.4 R^2 â†’ Rp = sqrt(0.4) R â‰ˆ 0.632 R.

Which would make the amplitude (Rp/R)^2 = 0.4, which is 40%, but that's larger than any of the options. So probably not.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let's try to think again.

The question is: to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what planet radius would be needed.

The amplitude caused by the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The amplitude caused by the spots is what we're trying to compute.

So perhaps the correct approach is to model the spots as a dip in brightness proportional to the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

So the dip is (f_hemi * f_spots) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Where f_hemi is the fraction of the star's surface covered by the spot hemisphere (which is 1/2, since only one hemisphere is spotty), and f_spots is the filling factor (0.2).

So the total fractional area covered by spots is (1/2) * 0.2 = 0.1.

Then, the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which is 0.1 * (1 - 0.482253) â‰ˆ 0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

So amplitude_spot â‰ˆ 5.177%.

So the planet's amplitude must be the same, so Rp^2 / Rstar^2 = 0.05177.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) â‰ˆ 0.2275.

Hmm, but 0.2275 is not one of the options. The options are A) 0.39, B) 0.07, C) 0.11, D) 0.32.

Wait, option B is 0.07, which is around 0.07. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute.

If the spot covers f * (area of hemisphere) =0.2 * 2 pi R^2.

The area of the star is 4 pi R^2.

So the fraction of the star's area covered by spots is (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) ) = (0.4 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So area covered is 10% of the star's surface.

But when the star rotates, the spot comes into view. So the maximum dip would be 10% of the star's surface when the spot is fully visible.

But each spot is cooler. So the dip is 10% times (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

So,

dip = 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) â‰ˆ 0.1 * (1 - 0.482253) = 0.1 * 0.517747 â‰ˆ 0.05177.

So planet's transit amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) â‰ˆ 0.2275.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. The closest is option D) 0.32, which is bigger, and option C) 0.11, which is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's radius is R_star, and the planet's radius is R_p. The dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, the area of the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So the spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

The star's total area is 4 pi R^2.

So the fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1.

So when the spot is fully visible, the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) â‰ˆ 0.05177.

So to get the same dip, the planet's area must block the same fraction, 0.05177.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 â†’ Rp/Rstar â‰ˆ 0.2275.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is R_sun, and the problem asks for R_p / R_star. So if the correct Rp/Rstar is ~0.23, but the options don't have it, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the difference between the spot and non-spot hemisphere, not the entire star.

Wait, no, the star's brightness when a hemisphere is spotty and when it's not would cause a variation in brightness as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip is when the spot is fully visible, but the star's brightness when the spot is not visible is F0, and when it is, F = F0 * (1 - dip), where dip is the area fraction times the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) â‰ˆ 0.05177, as earlier.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 â†’ Rp/Rstar â‰ˆ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

But the options don't include this. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.11, which is (0.11)^2 â‰ˆ 0.0121, which is way smaller than 0.05177.

Option B is 0.07, which is (0.07)^2 = 0.0049, which is even smaller.

Option A is 0.39, which is (0.39)^2 â‰ˆ 0.152, which is larger than the dip we calculated.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to appear and disappear, leading to a periodic brightness variation. The maximum dip occurs when the spot is fully visible, and the maximum brightness occurs when the spot is on the far side.

Wait, but the star's total brightness when the spot is on the far side is F0, and when it's on the near side, it's F = F0 - dip.

The amplitude is (F0 - F)/F0 = dip.

So dip = 0.05177, as before.

So the planet's dip must be 0.05177, which requires Rp/Rstar â‰ˆ 0.2275.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature isn't directly used, but the flux comes from the entire star, so the flux from the spot is a fraction of the total.

Wait, another approach: The star emits a certain flux. The spots contribute less flux than the surrounding. So when the spots are in view, the total flux is F = F0 * (1 - f * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )) )

Wait, f is the filling factor, but in this case, the spot is on a hemisphere, so the area fraction is (f * area of hemisphere) / (area of star) ) = f * (2 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi R^2 ) ) = f * 0.5.

So the area fraction is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Then, the average flux when the spot is visible is F = F0 * [1 - 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ]

Which is F = F0 * [ 1 - 0.1 * (1 - 0.482253) ]

= F0 * [ 1 - 0.1 * 0.517747 ]

= F0 * [ 1 - 0.0517747 ]

= F0 * 0.948225.

So the dip is 1 - 0.948225 = 0.051775, same as before.

So the planet's amplitude is 0.051775.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) â‰ˆ 0.2275.

Hmm, but the options don't include this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation period leads to a varying spot coverage as seen from Earth, but perhaps the model is that the spot is on the equator, and the star's rotation leads to half of the spot being visible at maximum. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the planet transiting, but the spot causing a symmetric variation, leading to a larger amplitude because the spot is on one hemisphere only.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to equate the dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spot.

Given that, the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rs)^2.

The dip from the spot is the same as a planet with Rp = sqrt( dip ) * Rs.

But our dip is 0.051775, so Rp = sqrt(0.051775)* Rs â‰ˆ 0.2275 Rs.

Which is approximately 0.23 Rs.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11, which is about half of that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot as a dark spot, so the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ) * (area fraction).

Wait, perhaps the spot's area is f * (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2.

The total area of the star is 4 pi R^2.

So the area fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) â‰ˆ 0.1 * 0.517747 â‰ˆ 0.05177.

So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.05177 â†’ Rp/Rs â‰ˆ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296.

Yes, 625 divided by 1296 is approximately 0.48225.

But perhaps I should use a calculator to get a more precise value.

625 Ã· 1296:

1296 Ã— 0.48 = 619.68,

1296 Ã— 0.482 = 619.68 + 2*1296*0.001 = 619.68 + 2.592 = 622.272.

Wait, 1296 Ã— 0.48225 = 625.

So, 0.48225 is correct.

So dip = 0.1 * 0.51775 â‰ˆ 0.051775.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot as a bright spot, but no, spots are cooler, so they are darker.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's area as 10% of the star's disk, leading to a dip of 10% * (1 - (5/6)^4 ), which is about 5.177%, as above.

So the planet's dip must be the same, which requires Rp/Rs â‰ˆ 0.2275.

So none of the options match this. Thus, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the star's flux is modeled as F = sigma Teff^4 (pi R^2) / D^2, considering that we see a hemisphere. So when a spot is present, the flux is F = (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 (pi R^2) + f * sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4 (pi R^2) ) / D^2.

So the flux without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 (pi R^2) / D^2.

The flux with spots is F = [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] * sigma pi R^2 / D^2.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F) / F0 = 1 - [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 / Teff^4 ) ].

Which is 1 - [ (1-f) + f (5/6)^4 ].

So,

amplitude = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2*(0.48225) ] = 1 - [0.8 + 0.09645 ] = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355.

So amplitude is about 10.355%.

So the planet's amplitude must be 10.355%, which is (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.10355 â†’ Rp/Rs â‰ˆ sqrt(0.10355) â‰ˆ 0.3218.

Ah, that's about 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, that makes more sense. So perhaps my earlier mistake was not correctly considering the star's flux when viewed from Earth as seeing only a hemisphere.

So, let me clarify.

When you view a star, you see a hemisphere. So the flux without any spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 (pi R^2) / D^2.

When the spot is present on the visible hemisphere, the flux is F = (1-f) sigma Teff^4 (pi R^2) + f sigma (Teff - delta_T)^4 (pi R^2) , divided by D^2.

So,

F = sigma pi R^2 [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ] / D^2.

The amplitude is (F0 - F)/F0 = 1 - [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - delta_T)^4 ) / Teff^4 ]

= 1 - [ (1-f) + f ( (Teff - delta_T)^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

= 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 ].

Calculate (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 â‰ˆ0.48225.

So,

0.8 + 0.2 * 0.48225 â‰ˆ 0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645.

So,

amplitude = 1 - 0.89645 â‰ˆ 0.10355, which is about 10.355%.

So the planet's amplitude must be the same, so (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.10355 â†’ Rp/Rs â‰ˆ sqrt(0.10355) â‰ˆ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) in a star's light curve as a star with dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (5000 K).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Amplitude from Spots**:
   - The star's flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \frac{\pi R^2}{D^2} \).
   - When the spot hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F = \sigma \pi R^2 \left[ (1 - f) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f (T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T)^4 \right] / D^2
     \]
     where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor, and \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \).
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = 1 - \frac{F}{F_0} = 1 - \left[ (1 - f) + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 \right] = 1 - 0.89645 \approx 0.10355
     \]
     Thus, the amplitude caused by the spots is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

2. **Amplitude from a Planet**:
   - The amplitude caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude caused by the spots, set \( \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.32 \) matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star is approximately \( 0.32 \) times the radius of the host star.

**Answer: D**
