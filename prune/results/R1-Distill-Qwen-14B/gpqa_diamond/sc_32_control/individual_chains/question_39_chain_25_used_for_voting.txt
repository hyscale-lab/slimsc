Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When measuring the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. And for the particle to be found only between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Or wait, no, actually, the wave function here is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But the problem states that when they measured the particles, they weren't found outside x=1 and x=3. So does that mean that the wave function is zero outside that region?

Wait, no. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function can't be non-zero outside the region where the particle exists, right? Because if the wave function is non-zero beyond x=3 or below x=1, then there's a probability of finding the particle there. But the measurements showed none, implying that the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems to be a complex function, but I'm not sure how that ties into the boundaries. Maybe I'm mixing this up. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle exists. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero. But the given function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the function given is only valid between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the function is only non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the question says when measuring, none were found outside. So the wave function must be zero outside 1 and 3. But the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, perhaps the given wave function is the entire function, and we have to find 'a' such that the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3. Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but this is valid only where the particle exists. So the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. But the expression they've given is for a certain region. So perhaps the wave function is of the form (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, no. Because if the wave function is zero outside, then the given expression must be valid only within x=1 to x=3. So the expression (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i is the wave function in that interval. But then, that's a complex function, which is fine because wave functions can be complex. But how does that help us find 'a'?

Oh right, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of the square modulus of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Since the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, we only integrate from 1 to 3.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me write down ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ], because when you take the modulus of a complex number a + bi, it's sqrt(a² + b²), so the square is a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25).

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each integral:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² ln(1+x). Evaluated between 1 and 3: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the closest. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, but wait: the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Its square modulus is [ (a^2)/(1+x) ] + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. So integral from 1 to3: ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx =1.

Breaking it down: ∫ [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3 is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So the equation is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1 → a²= (0.5)/ln2 ≈ 0.5/0.6931≈0.7213.

a≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is observed only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). Outside this interval, the wave function is zero. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), we only integrate over this interval. The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Split the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.849 \) is **0.85**.
