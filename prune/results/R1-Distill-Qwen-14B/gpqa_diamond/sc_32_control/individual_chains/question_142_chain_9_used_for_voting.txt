Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum info, but let's think this through.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, pure states are when the density matrix is a projection operator, like |ψ><ψ|, but mixed states are combinations of these.

So, what does this ρ represent? It looks like an equal mixture of |0> and |1>. Because each term is |0><0| and |1><1|, which are projectors for the states |0> and |1>, and they're added together and multiplied by 1/2. So, this is a classical mixture of the two basis states. That makes sense because the trace would be 1/2 + 1/2 =1, which it should be for a valid density matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think the qubit space is represented in the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each qubit state can be represented as a point on the surface of a unit sphere.

But wait, this is a mixed state. Pure states are on the surface, but mixed states are inside the sphere. Because the state is a mixture, it's in the interior.

The Bloch vector for a qubit is typically represented as r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. So, for a general state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's compute r for the given ρ. Let's express ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is (|0><0| + |1><1| + |0><1| + |1><0| ) / 2? Wait, no. Wait, I is (|0><0| + |1><1|), because when you have a 2x2 identity matrix in qubit terms, it's just that. Oh wait, the identity matrix is I = |0><0| + |1><1|, and the Pauli matrices are X, Y, Z.

Wait, the general form for a density matrix is ρ = (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2, right? So, if we can express the given ρ in this form, we can find r_x, r_y, r_z.

Our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute each component.

The identity matrix I is |0><0| + |1><1|, so I/2 is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Which is exactly our ρ. So, ρ = I/2.

Wait, but when we write ρ in terms of Pauli matrices, we have:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2.

But in this case, our ρ is I/2. So, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2.

So, subtracting I/2 from both sides gives (r·σ)/2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero. That implies that r is zero vector.

Wait, that's interesting. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin. But wait, the origin in the Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state. Because any mixed state can be represented as a point inside the sphere, but the origin represents the maximally mixed state. So, for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is exactly what we have here.

Looking back at the options: option C is (0,0,0), which would correspond to the origin. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The density matrix is I/2. When writing it as (I + r·σ)/2, the r would have to be zero because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So yes, r is (0,0,0). So option C is correct.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. Since it is a mixed state, it lies inside the Bloch sphere rather than on its surface. 

The Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\), respectively. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (X, Y, Z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\). This implies that \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector \(r\) is the zero vector \((0, 0, 0)\). 

The point \((0, 0, 0)\) in the Bloch sphere corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is exactly the state described by \(\rho\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
