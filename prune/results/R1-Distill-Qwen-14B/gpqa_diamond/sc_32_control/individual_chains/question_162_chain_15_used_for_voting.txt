Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to work through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it only has dx and dy terms. So the spacetime here is 2-dimensional, maybe like a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. Their properties are different from spheres. So the metric must be representing some kind of hyperbolic geometry.

I remember that the metric for a pseudosphere can be written in terms of coordinates. Maybe this metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk has a metric of the form ds² = (4/(1 - r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. But wait, in this problem, the metric is given in (x,y) coordinates, but it's expressed as (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which would mean that x² + y² < 4 for the metric to be real, I think.

So the area element in this metric would be the determinant of the metric tensor's components. The metric tensor g_ij is diagonal here since it's only dx² and dy² terms. So the determinant would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))² multiplied by the determinant of the identity matrix, which is 1. So the area element dA is (32²)/(4 - x² - y²)^2 dx dy.

Wait, but wait, when you compute the area of a surface, you integrate the area element over the entire surface. But since this is a metric on a 2D surface, perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space. So the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, but wait, pseudospheres can have infinite area because of their negative curvature. Or is this a sphere in some other metric?

Wait, no, pseudospheres (like the tractricoid) are finite in extent but have infinite area. Because their Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere, which affects the area. So when you have a surface of constant negative curvature, the area enclosed by a circle (or a geodesic) increases exponentially with the radius, so the total area becomes infinite as the radius approaches the curvature radius.

But wait, the question says, what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2? Hmm. Or maybe I'm confusing pseudosphere with something else. Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the radius of the disk is related to the curvature. The curvature K is -1/(radius)^2. So if the radius is 2, the curvature would be -1/4.

Wait, but the pseudosphere itself is a surface of constant negative curvature, which is a different concept. The area of a pseudosphere is actually finite, right? Wait, no, I think the pseudosphere's area is infinite. Because as you go towards infinity in the hyperbolic plane, the area keeps increasing. So the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the metric given and determining what the area of the surface described by this metric is. Since the metric is given, perhaps it's the metric of a pseudosphere, and the area is computed from that.

So looking back at the metric: ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let's check if this is similar to known metrics. The Poincaré disk model usually has a metric with denominator (1 - x² - y²)^2, but here the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So perhaps the overall scaling is different.

Wait, the area element in the Poincaré disk model is dA = [ (2)/(1 - (x² + y²)) ]² dx dy. Because the metric is (4/(1 - r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), with r = sqrt(x² + y²). So the area element would be (4/(1 - r²))² r dr dθ, but in Cartesian coordinates, it's (4/(1 - x² - y²))² dx dy.

Wait, no, maybe I should be careful. In Cartesian coordinates, the area element for the Poincaré disk with radius a is [4/(a² - (x² + y²))]² dx dy. Because the Poincaré disk's metric is usually written as ds² = (4/a²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²)^2 (dx² + dy²). So for a=2, it would be (4/(4 - (x² + y²)))^2 (dx² + dy²). Wait, but the given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), which is different.

Wait, maybe I can compute the area. The area would be the integral over all x and y where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² <4. So the integration domain is a disk of radius 2.

The area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²))² dx dy. Wait, no, wait. The area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, which for a diagonal metric is (g_xx * g_yy)^(1/2). But in this case, g is (32/(4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y². So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))². So the area element is (32/(4 - r²))² dx dy.

Wait, but wait, when integrating in polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the area element is (32/(4 - r²))² * r dr dθ.

So the total area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to θ=2π.

So A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2 ] * r dr dθ.

Let me factor out the constants. 32 squared is 1024. So,

A = (1024) * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²)^2 ] dr.

First, integrate over θ: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 1024 * 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²)^2 ] dr.

Now compute the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²)^2 dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u^2) * (-du/2).

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) u^{-2} du.

Flipping the limits, it becomes (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) u^{-2} du.

Integrate u^{-2}: ∫u^{-2} du = -u^{-1} + C.

So evaluating from 0 to4:

(1/2) [ (-1/u) from 0 to4 ].

Wait, but as u approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/u goes to +infinity. So this integral diverges? Because when r approaches 2, u approaches 0, and the integral becomes unbounded.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Let me double-check: u=4−r² → du=−2r dr → (−du/2) = r dr. So substituting into the integral ∫ [ r dr / (4−r²)^2 ] becomes ∫ [ (−du/2) / u² ].

So the integral becomes - (1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) u^{-2} du = (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) u^{-2} du.

Which is (1/2) [ (-1/u) evaluated from 0 to 4 ].

At u=4 → (-1/4), at u=0 → approaches -infinity. So [ (-1/4) - (-infty) ] → (−1/4 + ∞) = ∞.

So the integral ∫ r/(4−r²)^2 dr from 0 to2 is divergent; it goes to infinity.

Which means the area A is (1024 * 2π) * (infinite) → infinity.

So the area is infinite. So among the options, D is +infty.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the metric given is similar to a hyperbolic metric, which typically has infinite area when considering the entire space. But a pseudosphere is a finite surface, right? Or is that not the case?

Wait, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Because it's a surface of constant negative curvature, so as you go further out, the circumference increases without bound. So the total area is indeed infinite.

So looking at the options:

A) 0 — that can't be right.

B) 4π(x² + y²) — that's a function of x and y, but area should be a number, not a function.

C) 4π(x² − y²) — same issue as B.

D) +infty — yes, that makes sense.

So the answer must be D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. This metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the denominator corresponds to \(4 - (x^2 + y^2)\). The domain of integration is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), as the metric becomes singular when \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\).

To compute the area of the surface, the area element is derived from the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2 r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2 r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants, the integral becomes:

\[
A = 1024 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_{0}^{2} \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{2} \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{u^2} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \(\int \frac{1}{u^2} \, du\) approaches infinity as \(u \to 0\). Since the integral diverges, the total area is infinite.

In the context of the pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature, the area is indeed infinite due to the unbounded nature of hyperbolic geometry. Among the given options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area should be a numerical value, not a function of \(x\) and \(y\).
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect for the same reason as B.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
