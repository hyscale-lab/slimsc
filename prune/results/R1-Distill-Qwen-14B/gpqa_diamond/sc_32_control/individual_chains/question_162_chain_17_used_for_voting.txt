Alright, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? It's expressed in terms of x and y coordinates. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, wait. What's a pseudosphere? Oh right, in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I also remember that in 2D, a pseudosphere can be represented in a conformally flat metric, which this seems to be because the metric is a function times (dx² + dy²). So the function here is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element in such a metric would be the determinant of the metric tensor's components. The metric tensor is diagonal, so the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²)) multiplied by (dx dy) squared, but wait, no, the area element is sqrt(g) d²x, where g is the determinant of the metric. Since the metric here is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. So the area element dA would be sqrt( (32/(4 - x² - y²))² ) dx dy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the metric is g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{yy} is the same. So the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy} because it's diagonal. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Then the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Wait, no: because the area element in 2D is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. Since g_xy =0 here, it's sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) = sqrt(g_xx) * sqrt(g_yy). But since both g_xx and g_yy are equal, that's (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * dx dy. Wait, no, no, wait again. The area element is sqrt(g) dxdy, where g is the determinant. The determinant is g_xx * g_yy (since it's diagonal) because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So det g = (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² = x² + y². So the area element is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) dr dθ, because when you switch to polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So sqrt of the determinant is 32/(4 - r²). So area element dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of integrating this over some region. But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, what's a pseudosphere's area? Oh, but wait, pseudospheres are models of hyperbolic geometry, which have infinite area. Like, the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area, right? But wait, in this case, the metric is written in terms of x and y. What's the domain of x and y here?

Looking at the denominator, 4 - x² - y². For the metric to be real, 4 - x² - y² must be positive, so x² + y² <4. So the coordinate system here covers a disk of radius 2 (since 4 is 2²) in the x-y plane. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface, not a plane. Hmm, maybe the metric represents a space of constant curvature. Oh wait, the given metric is conformally flat, which makes sense for a 2D surface of constant curvature. So, to find the area, perhaps I need to integrate the area element over the entire space. But wait, the space here is a disk of radius 2 (since x² + y² <4). But wait, if the curvature is negative, then the surface might extend beyond that, but in this coordinate system, perhaps only a part is covered.

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, the entire hyperbolic plane is mapped to a disk of radius 2 (assuming a certain scaling). So the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite. But if the metric's domain is only this disk, integrating over it gives the area of the model, but the actual hyperbolic plane's area is infinite. So, perhaps the area of the pseudosphere (which I think refers to the hyperbolic plane in this context) is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing terms. In higher dimensions, a pseudosphere is a type of soliton solution in general relativity, but I'm not too familiar with that. Alternatively, perhaps the term refers to a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, which would indeed have infinite area.

Alternatively, maybe the question is more straightforward. The metric given is for a two-dimensional space. The area would be the integral of the area element over all space where the metric is defined. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So the region is x² + y² <4. So the area would be the integral over that disk.

Wait, so the area A is the integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Let's compute that. Switching to polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So dx dy = r dr dθ. The integral becomes ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute that. The integral over θ is 2π. The radial integral is 32 ∫ (0 to 2) r / (4 - r²) dr. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (u=4 to 0) [r dr]/u = 32 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (-du)/(2u) ) * (because r dr = -du/2). So substituting, 32 * ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-du/2) / u ] = 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (-1/u) du. Hmm, flipping the limits to 0 to4, the negative becomes positive, so becomes 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = 16 [ln u] from 0 to4.

Wait, but ln u as u approaches 0 from the positive side is negative infinity. So the integral becomes 16 (ln4 - ln0) = 16 (ln4 - (-infty)) which is 16*(infinite). So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. So the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we analyze the metric and compute the area element. The area element in a metric \( ds^2 = g_{xx}(x, y) dx^2 + g_{yy}(x, y) dy^2 \) is given by \( dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is \( \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), so the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The region of integration is determined by the denominator \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \), which implies \( r^2 < 4 \) or \( r < 2 \). Thus, the total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( \theta \):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln u \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the area is infinite.

The pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) corresponds to a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) 0**  
**B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**  
**C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**  
**D) \( +\infty \)**  

The area of the pseudosphere is infinite, so the correct choice is:
