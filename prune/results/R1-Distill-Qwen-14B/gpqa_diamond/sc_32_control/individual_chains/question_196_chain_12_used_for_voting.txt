Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, but relativistic... Oh right, that means we can't use the classical equations directly because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant. So I'll have to consider relativistic mechanics here.

In the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal, we get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so that can't be the answer here.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy E of the system would include both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The potential energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator might also be different, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the force law is the same, but the dynamics are treated relativistically.

Let me think. In special relativity, momentum p is related to velocity v by p = gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². At maximum amplitude x = A, the potential energy is highest, but the kinetic energy is zero. At equilibrium points (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the relationship between energy and velocity might be more complicated because of the relativistic effects on momentum and energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic form of the harmonic oscillator equation of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is different from the classical one. Let me recall. The equation of motion in classical mechanics is F = -k x = m a, but relativistically, we need to consider the momentum's time derivative, which would be d(p)/dt, where p is gamma m v.

So, the equation would be d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Hmm, but solving this differential equation might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of energy.

Wait, the total energy in a relativistic oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy plus kinetic energy. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the virial theorem applies, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². At maximum speed, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is (gamma -1)m c².

So, total energy E = rest energy (m c²) + kinetic energy + potential energy. Wait, but in the oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So at maximum displacement x = A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is zero. So the total energy is m c² + (1/2)k A².

Wait no, wait: in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, the kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E_classical = (1/2)k A².

But relativistically, the total energy is different. The particle's total energy should include the rest mass energy, plus the potential energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, perhaps in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So at maximum amplitude, x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is m c² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Because the rest mass energy is m c², and the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is m c² + (1/2)k A².

At the point of maximum speed, which occurs when x = 0 (the equilibrium position), all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy. So at x=0, potential energy is zero, and kinetic energy is maximum.

So the kinetic energy is E - m c² = (1/2)k A². So setting kinetic energy equal to (gamma -1) m c², which is the relativistic kinetic energy.

So, (gamma -1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

Let me write that equation:

gamma m c² - m c² = (1/2)k A²,
gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A²,
gamma = [m c² + (1/2)k A²] / (m c²).

Simplifying that,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call that term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable for simplicity, say, let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as Q. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + Q.

Then, solving for v:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + Q).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + Q)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2.

Simplify the right-hand side:

1 can be written as (1 + Q)^2/(1 + Q)^2,

so,

v²/c² = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Expanding (1 + Q)^2,

(1 + 2 Q + Q² - 1) / (1 + Q)^2 = (2Q + Q²) / (1 + Q)^2.

But wait, if Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²), perhaps for small Q, we can approximate, but the question is general. So, let's proceed.

So,

v² = c² * [ (2 Q + Q²) / (1 + Q)^2 ].

Plugging back Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²),

v² = c² [ ( 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator:

2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So numerator is (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator is [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4)) ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ) ]

Factor numerator:

= c² [ ( (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4) ) / (4 m² c^4) ) ) / ( (2 m c² + k A²)^2/( (2 m c²)^2 ) ) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to factor out terms.

Wait, perhaps let's factor the numerator:

k A²/(m c²) [ 1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ].

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Let me write the entire numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) = (4 m c² k A² + k² A^4) ) / (4 m^2 c^4)

Denominator: [2 m c² + k A²]^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Wait, wait, denominator is [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2) )/(2 m c^2) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So putting it together,

v² = c² * [ numerator / denominator ]

numerator = (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4) ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )
denominator = (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c² * [ (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ) / (4 m^2 c^4) ) ] * [4 m² c^4 / (2 m c^2 + k A²)^2 ]

Simplify:

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel, and the 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 is the numerator.

So,

v² = c² * [ (4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ) / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Factor numerator:

4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 = k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ) / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the terms.

Wait, 4 m c² = 2 * 2 m c², but not sure. Alternatively, let me see if (4 m c² + k A^2 ) can be expressed in terms of (2 m c² + k A^2 ).

Wait,

4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 = not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor out 2 m c^2.

Wait, 4 m c^2 is 2*(2 m c^2), so,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 = (2 m c^2) + (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps write it as:

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A² )^2 )

= c² k A^2 [ (4 m c² + k A^2) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps simplify (4 m c^2 + k A^2) = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 + k A^2/2 )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps write 4 m c² as (2 m c²)*2.

Wait, perhaps let me factor out 2 m c^2 from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, (4 m c^2 + k A^2) = 2 m c^2 * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]

And denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = [2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2

So,

v^2 = c² * [ k A^2 * 2 m c² * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2)^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) ]

Simplify:

v^2 = c² * [ 2 m c² k A^2 (2 + term) ) ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + term)^2 ) ]

Where term is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 m c² k A^2 (2 + term) → 2 m c^2 k A^2 [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Denominator: 4 m² c^4 (1 + term)^2 → 4 m^2 c^4 [1 + term]^2

So,

v² = c² [ (2 m c^2 k A^2 (2 + term )) / (4 m² c^4 (1 + term)^2 ) ) ]

Cancel terms:

2 m c^2 / 4 m² c^4 = (2 m c^2) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) )

= (2) / (4 m c^2 )

= 1/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 2 m c^2 in numerator, 4 m^2 c^4 in denominator.

So,

(2 m c^2) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ) = (2) / (4 m c^2 ) ) = 1/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² * [ (1/(2 m c² )) * k A^2 (2 + term) ) / ( (1 + term )^2 ) ]

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factoring. Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just plug the expression of gamma back into v.

We had earlier:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = 1 + Q, where Q is k A²/(2 m c² )

Then,

gamma = 1 + Q,

and,

gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + Q)^2,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2,

= [ (1 + Q)^2 -1 ] / (1 + Q )^2,

= [ 1 + 2 Q + Q^2 -1 ] / (1 + Q )^2,

= (2 Q + Q^2 )/(1 + Q )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2 Q + Q^2 )/(1 + Q )^2,

and substituting Q = k A^2/(2 m c² ), we get,

v^2 = c^2 [ 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

2 * (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = (k A²)/(m c² )

Plus (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So numerator is (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

Factor numerator:

= [ (4 m c² k A²) + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ (4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 in numerator and denominator cancel.

So,

v² = c² [ (4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator:

= c² [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2

Hmm, not sure if this simplifies further. Maybe it's best to look at the options given and see which form matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, that denominator inside the square root looks off dimensionally because (k A²)/(2m) has units of (N m² )/( kg ) → (kg m/s² * m² )/( kg ) → ( kg m^3/s² )/(kg ) → m^3/s². So that's not dimensionless, but inside the square root, the argument must be dimensionless. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) )

Wait, (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is dimensionless, because kg m²/(kg m²/s² ) ) → 1/s² * s² → dimensionless. So 1 - something dimensionless, and then 1 divided by that.

Wait, let's compute the expression inside the square root in option B.

Inside sqrt: 1 + 1/( 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= (2 -x )/(1 -x )

Hmm, but in our expression for v², it's [ (2 Q + Q^2 ) / (1 + Q )^2 ] where Q = x/2.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Maybe the relation between velocity and the amplitude in a relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by a specific formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is different. The equation is d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Let me consider that.

The equation is:

d/dt (gamma m v ) = -k x.

But in SHM, the relation between acceleration and displacement is a = - (k/m) x. But relativistically, the equation is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular frequency is different.

Wait, I'm not too confident about this approach. Maybe I should think about energy again.

Earlier, I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Which gives,

gamma = [ m c² + (1/2) k A² ] / ( m c² )

So,

gamma = [ m c² + (1/2)k A^2 ] / ( m c^2 )

= 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

Which is what I had before.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Square both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c² ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) - 1

= 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

= (k A^2)/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

v^2 = c² [ (k A^2/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Wait, but this seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can factor out (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) from the numerator.

So,

v^2 = c² [ (k A^2/(m c² )) ( 1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Let me denote x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so Q = x.

Then, the numerator inside the brackets is (2 x ) ( 1 + (x/2 ) ), because (k A^2)/(4 m c² ) = x/2.

Wait, because x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 ) = x/2.

So,

Numerator becomes (2 x ) * ( 1 + x/2 ) )

Denominator is (1 + x )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 x (1 + x/2 )) / (1 + x )^2 ]

= c^2 [ 2x ( (2 + x )/2 ) ) ] / (1 + x )^2

= c^2 [ x (2 + x ) ] / (1 + x )^2

But x = (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c² * [ ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Simplify numerator:

= c^2 [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * ( (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Wait, let's compute each part:

Numerator inside:

(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * ( (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2

= [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c² * [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

= c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / 4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / 4 m² c^4 )

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel out.

So,

v² = c² [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Hmm, but I'm not sure this matches any of the options. Let me look back at the options.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute 1 minus 1/(1+x)^2 where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Inside the sqrt: 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1+x)^2 - 1 ] / (1+x)^2

= [1 + 2x + x^2 -1 ] / (1 + x )^2

= (2x + x^2 )/(1 +x )^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 * (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2

So,

v = c sqrt( (2x + x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

But x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) = sqrt( (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

= sqrt( (k A^2/(2 m c² )) * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ] )

= sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear match to any of the options.

Wait, looking back, in option A:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, but (k A^2)/(2m) has units of m²/s² * m²/(kg) → kg m^3/s² / kg → m^3/s^2. Which is not dimensionless, so that can't be right.

Option B: sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, but (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is dimensionless, so 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is dimensionless, and 1/(something) is also dimensionless. So 1 + something is dimensionless, so sqrt of that is dimensionless multiplied by c.

Similarly for option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1+x)^2 where x = k A²/(2 m c^2 )

Which is ( (1+x)^2 -1 )/(1 +x )^2 ) = (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2.

So, for option D, v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( (2x +x^2)/(1+x)^2 ) c.

Which matches what I derived earlier.

Hmm, but according to my earlier derivation, v²/c² is (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2, so v = c * sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1+x )^2 ), which is the same as sqrt( (2x +x²)/(1+x )^2 ) c.

Which is the same as option D, because option D says sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), which is sqrt( (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2 )

Wait, yes. Because 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 is (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2.

So, option D's expression is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( (2x + x²)/(1 +x )^2 ) c, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

So, option D's expression is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option C is the non-relativistic case. So in the options, the correct one is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes it's easy to get mixed up in the algebra.

Looking back, the approach I took was based on energy conservation. So:

Total energy = rest mass energy + (1/2) k A^2.

At maximum speed (x=0), all that energy is in kinetic, which in relativity is (gamma -1) m c².

So,

gamma -1 = (1/2)k A^2 / (m c² )

Wait, no, wait: total energy E is m c² + (1/2)k A².

At x=0, E = kinetic energy + rest mass energy. Wait, no: in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So,

E = m c² + K.

But when x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A², kinetic is zero, so E = m c² + (1/2)k A².

So,

K = E - m c² = (1/2)k A².

And K is (gamma -1) m c².

So,

(gamma -1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/( 2 m c² )

Which gives the expression for gamma.

Then, solving for v, we get v = c * sqrt( [ 2x + x² ]/(1 +x )^2 ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \). At \( x = A \), the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2
   \]  
   At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1) m c^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1) m c^2 = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]  

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Simplifying further:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]  

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
