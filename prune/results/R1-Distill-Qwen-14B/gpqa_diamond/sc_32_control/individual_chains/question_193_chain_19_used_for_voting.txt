Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question says: In a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r? The options are A to D, each with different exponents on r.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. So, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance, right? Like, plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs, I think. Because I remember that 1 parsec is the distance where 1 astronomical unit subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond. So, if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller.

So, if plx is 1/r, then r is 1/plx. Let me write that down: r = 1/plx. So, plx = 1/r. Got it.

Now, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). So substituting plx with 1/r, that would be 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is equal to r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so the reciprocal is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm. So that's the number of stars per distance unit. So, maybe it's the differential number of stars with respect to r. Oh, right! Because when you observe a region of the sky, the number of stars you see depends on the volume of space you're looking at, which depends on distance.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would depend on the volume. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So, if the density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars would be proportional to r² dr. But wait, the question is more about how N varies with distance, not volume. Wait, but N is given as proportional to 1/plx^5. So let me think about that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's break it down. Since plx is 1/r, then plx^5 is 1/r^5. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But that's for a given plx, how does N change with r? But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, it's the number per unit distance. So, perhaps it's the differential N with respect to r.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a given region could be related to the volume, assuming a uniform distribution. But in this case, the number varies as 1/plx^5, which we've determined is r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is a constant.

But if we're looking for how N changes with r, that's dN/dr. Oh, wait no, the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. Let me think. The number of stars per unit distance dr would be the number of stars in that thin shell, which is proportional to r^5 * dr. So, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^5.

Wait, no. If N is the total number up to distance r, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr. But in this problem, N is given as varying with plx as 1/plx^5, which we've converted to r^5. So N(r) = kr^5. Then, the number per unit distance is dN/dr = 5kr^4. That would imply the number increases with r^4, so the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about this. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k (1/plx^5) = k r^5. That's the total number of stars within distance r? Or is it the number density? Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding this. If the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, that's N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So, if r increases, N increases by r^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So if we have a region at distance r, how many stars are present per unit distance. Wait, no, perhaps it's the density of stars as a function of distance. Or perhaps, the number in a thin shell at distance r, which would be the differential.

So, the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would be N_shell = 4π r² dr * n(r), where n(r) is the number density. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for how the number of stars (perhaps per unit volume) varies with r. Wait, no: the question is about the number of stars in a region varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, when parallax plx is small (which is when r is large), the number of stars N increases as r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, so per unit r. So, if N is proportional to r^5, then the rate of change (dN/dr) would be proportional to r^4. So, the number of stars per unit distance (like in a slice) would be proportional to r^4. So the correct option would be option C, which is r^4.

Let me double-check. So plx = 1/r. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. Therefore, dN/dr = 5 r^4. So, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the answer is C.

The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely related to distance \( r \) (\( \text{plx} = 1/r \)), substituting \( \text{plx} \) with \( 1/r \) gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). To determine this, we consider the differential number of stars per unit distance, which is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
