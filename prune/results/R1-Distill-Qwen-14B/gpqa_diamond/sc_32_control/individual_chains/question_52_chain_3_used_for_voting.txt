Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the star has some parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, right. So, the key here is the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of each energy level depends on the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio without spots would be higher than with spots.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That's in the blue or UV range, I think. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Oh, perhaps not, because the ratio depends on temperature, not the wavelength itself. Wait, the energy difference between the levels is related to the wavelength. E = hc/λ. So maybe I can compute the energy difference using this.

Let me jot down the known values:

- T1 (no spots): 6000 K
- T2 (with spots): 5500 K
- λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters.

So first, I think I need to find the ratio (n1/n2) or (n2/n1) under both conditions, and then find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n2/n1 is lower. So the ratio when no spots is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So that would be (ratio_without_spots) / (ratio_with_spots) = factor.

Right. So I need to compute the ratio (n2/n1) for each Teff and then take the ratio of those two.

But wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. So,

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1) / (k T) )

But wait, E2 - E1 = hc/λ, because E = hc/λ. So the difference in energy is proportional to 1/λ.

Hmm, but wait, I think I should compute E2-E1 as hc/λ. So let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = let's compute that.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.374e-18 J.

But wait, how do we convert that to eV? Because maybe it's easier to work in eV for energy differences, but I'm not sure if I need to. Alternatively, perhaps I can just calculate the exponent in the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, the exponent is -(E2-E1)/(k T). So E is in J, k is Boltzmann constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Let me compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for both T1 and T2.

So E = 1.374e-18 J. Let's compute E/(k T) for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

For T=6000 K:

E/(k T) = (1.374e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) = (1.374e-18) / (8.28e-20) ) = approximately 16.57

Wait, that's a big number. But wait, wait a second, because 1.374e-18 / 8.28e-20 equals (1.374 / 8.28) * 1e2. Let's compute 1.374 / 8.28 ≈ 0.1657. Multiply by 100 gives 16.57. So about 16.57.

Similarly, for T=5500 K:

E/(k T) = 1.374e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 5500) = 1.374e-18 / 7.59e-20 = approximately 18.11.

Wait, so for T1=6000 K, the exponent is about 16.57, and for T2=5500 K, it's about 18.11.

So the Boltzmann factor for the ratio n2/n1 is exp( -E/(k T) ), but wait, actually, the exponent is negative. So the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -E/(k T) ).

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that E2 > E1, which implies that the transition is from level 2 to level 1, so the photon emitted has wavelength corresponding to that transition. So E2 is higher than E1.

Thus, E2 - E1 is positive, so the exponent becomes negative.

So for higher T, the exponential term is bigger (since E/(k T) is smaller, exponent is less negative), leading to a larger n2/n1 ratio.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say E is positive. So for T1=6000 K, E/(k T1) is 16.57, so the exponent is -16.57.

So exp(-16.57) is a very small number. Similarly, for T2=5500 K, exponent is -18.11, so even smaller.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So without spots (higher T), ratio is higher, which makes sense because the exponential term is less negative, so exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller.

But wait, the ratio of n2/n1 is equal to (g2/g1) * exponential term. But the problem doesn't say anything about g2/g1, so perhaps we can assume that the statistical weights are the same, or that they cancel out when taking the ratio of n2/n1 between the two cases.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T2) ) ] )

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out, so the factor is exp( [ -E/(k T1) + E/(k T2) ] )

Wait, let's compute that exponent.

In the numerator, it's exp(-E/(k T1)), denominator is exp(-E/(k T2)).

So when we divide them, it's exp( (-E/(k T1)) - (-E/(k T2)) ) ) = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, because when you subtract exponents, you add the exponents. So:

exp( -E/(k T1) ) / exp( -E/(k T2) ) = exp( (E/(k T2) - E/(k T1)) )

Which is E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So that's the exponent in the factor.

Now, calculate this:

Compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, and 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

So 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1.

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 1.5151e-5 K^-1.

Now, E/(k) is (1.374e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 1.374e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 1e5 (let me compute more accurately).

1.374e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.374 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.996 * 1e5 ≈ 99600 ≈ 9.96e4 K.

Wait, so E/(k) ≈ 9.96e4 K.

Now, multiply that by (1/T2 - 1/T1) which is 1.5151e-5 K^-1.

So 9.96e4 * 1.5151e-5 = approximately (9.96 * 1.5151) * 1e-1.

Compute 9.96 * 1.5151 ≈ 15.07.

So 15.07 * 0.1 = 1.507.

So the exponent is approximately 1.507.

So the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507.

What's e^1.5? e ≈ 2.71828, so e^1 ≈2.718, e^0.5≈1.648, so e^1.5 ≈ 4.481.

But 1.507 is a bit larger than 1.5. Let me compute e^1.507.

We can compute e^1.507 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.007.

e^0.007 is approximately 1 + 0.007 + (0.007)^2/2 ≈ 1.00700245.

So e^1.507 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.513.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me check the exponent again.

Wait, the exponent is [E/(k)] * [1/T2 - 1/T1] = 9.96e4 * (1.5151e-5) ≈ 9.96e4 * 1.5151e-5 = let's compute:

9.96e4 = 99600.

1.5151e-5 = 0.000015151.

Multiply: 99600 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 99600 * 0.000015151.

First, 99600 * 0.00001 = 0.996.

99600 * 0.000005151 = 99600 * 5.151e-6 ≈ 99600 * 0.000005151.

Compute 99600 * 5.151e-6:

5.151e-6 = 0.000005151.

Multiply 99600 by 0.000005151.

99600 * 0.000005151 = 0.5128416.

So total is 0.996 + 0.5128416 ≈ 1.5088.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5088.

So the factor is e^1.5088.

Compute e^1.5088.

We can use a calculator approximation, but let's think: ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(5)=1.609. So ln(4.5) is about 1.504.

Wait, so e^1.504 ≈ 4.5.

Since our exponent is 1.5088, which is about 0.0048 higher than 1.504.

So e^1.5088 = e^(1.504 + 0.0048) = e^1.504 * e^0.0048 ≈ 4.5 * (1 + 0.0048 + 0.0048^2/2) ≈ 4.5 * 1.00482 ≈ 4.5 * 1.0048 ≈ 4.5216.

So approximately 4.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation of the exponent again.

Wait, the exponent was (E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1.374e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.6667e-4.

So 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.

So (1.374e-18 / 1.38e-23) = 1.374 / 1.38 * 1e5 ≈ 0.996 * 1e5 ≈ 99600.

So 99600 * 1.513e-5 = 99600 * 1.513e-5.

Compute 99600 * 1.513e-5:

1.513e-5 is 0.00001513.

So 99600 * 0.00001513.

Compute 99600 * 0.00001 = 0.996.

99600 * 0.00000513 = ?

Let me compute 99600 * 0.000005 = 0.498.

99600 * 0.00000013 = 0.012948.

So 0.498 + 0.012948 = 0.510948.

So total is 0.996 + 0.510948 ≈ 1.506948.

So exponent is 1.506948.

e^1.506948 = ?

As earlier, e^1.504 is about 4.5. So e^1.506948 is a bit higher.

We can compute the difference: 1.506948 - 1.504 = 0.002948.

So e^1.504 * e^(0.002948) = 4.5 * (1 + 0.002948 + (0.002948)^2/2) ≈ 4.5 * (1.002948 + 0.0000436) ≈ 4.5 * 1.0029916 ≈ 4.51346.

So approximately 4.51.

So the factor is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which would be the correct answer.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2/g_1\) is the ratio of statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Energy Difference
The energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\) is related to the wavelength \(\lambda\) of the transition by:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.374 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann Constant Ratio
The Boltzmann constant is \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). The term \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k}\) is:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{1.374 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.96 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Difference Term
The temperatures are \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots). The term \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \approx 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 4: Exponent Calculation
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.96 \times 10^4)(1.513 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.507.
\]

### Step 5: Factor Calculation
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.507).
\]

Using \(e^{1.507} \approx 4.5\), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is:

**Answer: C**
