Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that X is a meson resonance. The question is asking about the mean decay distance. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or the mean proper decay length) has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is L = γ c τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). But wait, I'm a bit confused about the steps. Let me think again.

First, I need to find the proper lifetime τ. The width Γ is related to the lifetime. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. But units might be tricky here.

Wait, in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the units can sometimes be confusing. Let me make sure. The decay width Γ has units of energy. The lifetime τ has units of time. So to convert from Γ to τ, I need to use ħ, which has units of GeV·s. Because Γ is in GeV, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let's get the units right. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ will be in seconds when I divide ħ by Γ in GeV.

So first, convert Γ from MeV to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

Then τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers:

ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s
Γ = 0.32 GeV
So τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is the same as (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875, so yes, 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Hmm, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Right.

Now, I need the Lorentz factor γ to calculate the mean decay length. The Lorentz factor comes from the particle's velocity. But how do I find the velocity? The particle is produced with energy E = 8 GeV. Its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so m_X is 1.2 GeV.

So the energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Again, in natural units, this is E² = p² + m².

So E = sqrt(p² + m²). We can solve for p: p = sqrt(E² - m²). Let's plug in the numbers.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

E² = 64 (GeV²)
m² = 1.44 (GeV²)
So p² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV²
p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So the momentum p is ≈7.91 GeV.

Now, the velocity β can be found using E = γ m c². Also, p = γ m v, where v is the velocity. Alternatively, beta is v/c, and beta can be found from the relation p = gamma m beta.

Wait, in natural units, the velocity beta is given by beta = p c / E. Because in natural units, E = gamma m, p = gamma m beta. So beta = (p c) / (E). Since c is 1 in natural units, beta = p / E.

Wait, another approach: in natural units (c=1), beta = p/(E) * c, but wait, no, in natural units, beta is simply p/(E). Because E = gamma m, and p = gamma m beta. So beta = (p c) / E → but in natural units, c=1, so beta = p/E.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me write the expressions.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) → E^2 = p² c² + m² c^4. Divide both sides by c^4:

(E/(c^2))^2 = (p² c²)/(c^4) + m² → (E/(c^2))^2 = (p²)/(c²) + m².

But perhaps a better approach is to express beta as (pc²)/(E c). Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck, let me find beta in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, beta can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so beta = sqrt(1 - m² / E²).

So E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So m²/E² is (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887, which is about 0.99c.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 is 9775/10000, sqrt(9775) is approximately 98.87, so sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.9887)^2 ). Let's compute (0.9887)^2 = approx 0.9775. So 1-0.9775=0.0225. sqrt(0.0225)=0.15. So gamma is 1/0.15 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute beta squared:

beta = 0.9887 → beta^2 = (0.9887)^2 = 0.9775 (exactly as before). So 1 - beta^2 = 0.0225. sqrt(0.0225)=0.15. So gamma is 1/0.15 = 6.666..., which is 20/3 or approximately 6.6667.

So gamma ≈ 6.6667.

Now, the proper lifetime tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. The mean decay length is L = gamma * c * tau.

Wait, but wait, I thought L = gamma c tau, but wait, c is in m/s, so I need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, tau is in seconds. c is 3e8 m/s. So let's compute L.

L = gamma * c * tau.

gamma ≈6.6667, c=3e8 m/s, tau≈2.056875e-24 s.

So compute:

L ≈6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute the numbers step by step.

First, multiply 6.6667 by 3e8: 6.6667 *3e8 = 2e9 (approx), but let me compute precisely.

6.6667 *3e8 = 20e8 = 2e9? Wait, no: 6.6667 *3 = 20. So 6.6667 *3e8 = 20e8 = 2e9.

Wait, 6.6667 *3 =20, right. So 6.6667 *3e8 = 20e8 = 2e9.

Wait, 2e9 m/s is the velocity, but here, L is (gamma c tau).

So 6.6667 *3e8 = 2e9 m/s.

Now multiply by tau: 2e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

So the seconds cancel out, leaving meters.

So 2e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (2 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

So 4.11375e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation more accurately:

gamma =6.6667, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L =6.6667 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Let's compute 6.6667 *3e8 = 20e8 = 2e9 m/s.

Wait, wait, no: 6.6667 *3e8 = (6 *3e8) + (0.6667 *3e8) = 1.8e9 + 2e8= 2e9 approx.

Wait, 6.6667 *3e8 = 20e8 = 2e9? Hmm, 3e8 is 300,000,000. 6.6667 * 300,000,000 is 2,000,000,000. So yes, 2e9.

So 2e9 m/s * tau of 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 2e9 *2.056875e-24.

That's (2 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

2 *2.056875=4.11375.

So 4.11375e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15, option D is 4.0655e-16.

Wait, I got approximately 4.11e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15) but a bit higher. Did I make any mistakes in calculation?

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately. Let's redo the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I approximated beta and gamma too roughly. Let me re-calculate beta and gamma more accurately.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m²/E²) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

Compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely. Let me think.

0.9775 is 0.9775.

We can compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator approximation.

I know that sqrt(0.98) is about 0.98995, because 0.98995^2 = approx (0.99)^2 = 0.9801, but wait, 0.9899^2 = (0.98 + 0.0099)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0099 + (0.0099)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.019404 + 0.000098 ≈ 0.9800.

Wait, but our number is 0.9775, which is less than 0.98. So let's find a better approximation.

Wait, perhaps using a Taylor expansion. Let me consider x = 1 - y, where y=0.0225.

sqrt(x) ≈ 1 - (y/2) - (y^2)/(8) - ... 

So for x=0.9775, y=0.0225.

sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - 0.0225/2 - (0.0225)^2/(8).

Compute each term:

0.0225/2 = 0.01125.

(0.0225)^2 = 0.00050625. Divided by 8 is ~0.00006328125.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328125 = 0.98868671875.

So beta ≈0.988687.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.988687)^2) → compute (0.988687)^2.

0.988687 * 0.988687:

Let me compute 0.9887^2:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2.

0.98^2 =0.9604.

2*0.98 *0.0087 =2 *0.008526 =0.017052.

0.0087^2 =0.00007569.

Adding them up: 0.9604 +0.017052=0.977452 +0.00007569=0.97752769.

So beta^2 ≈0.97752769.

So 1 - beta^2= 0.02247231.

sqrt(0.02247231) = approx sqrt(0.0225) is 0.15, but more accurately:

Let me compute sqrt(0.02247231). Since 0.15^2=0.0225, which is 0.00002769 higher than 0.02247231. So let's find x where x=0.15 - delta, and (x)^2=0.02247231.

(0.15 - delta)^2 =0.0225 - 2*0.15 delta + delta^2=0.02247231.

Assume delta is small, so delta^2 is negligible.

0.0225 - 0.3 delta ≈0.02247231 → 0.0225 -0.02247231=0.3 delta → 0.00002769=0.3 delta → delta=0.00002769/0.3=0.0000923.

So x=0.15 -0.0000923=0.1499077.

So sqrt(0.02247231)=0.1499077.

So gamma=1/(0.1499077)=approx 6.668.

Wait, 1/0.1499077 → since 6.6667 is 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Wait, 0.1499077 is approximately 0.15 (6.6667 is 1/0.15). Let me compute 1/0.1499077.

Compute 0.1499077 ×6.6667 = approx 1?

0.1499077 *6.6667 ≈0.1499077 *6=0.8994462, plus 0.1499077 *0.6667≈0.099938 → total ≈0.999384, which is close to 1. So 1/0.1499077 is about 6.6667, so gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial approximation of gamma=6.6667 is still correct.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value of gamma is 6.6667.

Wait, so with gamma=6.6667, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So mean decay distance L = gamma * c * tau.

Compute L:

6.6667 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

First, 6.6667 *3e8 = 2e9 m/s.

Then, 2e9 m/s *2.056875e-24 s = 2e9 *2.056875e-24 m.

Multiply the numbers:

2 *2.056875 =4.11375.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-24 =1e-15.

So L=4.11375e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made some approximation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately the tau.

Earlier, tau was calculated as hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau =6.582e-25 /0.32 → let me compute that accurately.

6.582 / 0.32 → 6.582 ÷ 0.32.

0.32 ×20=6.4 → 20.56875 → 0.32 ×20.56875=6.582.

So 6.582e-25 /0.32 =20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, correct.

So, L=gamma*c*tau.

gamma=20/3=6.6666667.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s (approx 3e8 m/s).

So let me compute more accurately:

gamma=20/3=6.6666666667.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L= (20/3) * 2.99792458e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute step by step.

First, compute (20/3) *2.99792458e8.

20/3=6.6666666667.

6.6666666667 *2.99792458e8 = let's compute 6 *2.99792458e8 =1.798754748e9.

0.6666666667 *2.99792458e8= approx 1.998616387e8.

Adding together: 1.798754748e9 +1.998616387e8= 1.998616387e8 is 199,861,638.7. So 1.798754748e9 is 1,798,754,748.

Adding 1,798,754,748 +199,861,638.7 ≈1,998,616,386.7 → 1.998616387e9 m/s.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

6.6666666667 *2.99792458e8 = (20/3) *2.99792458e8 = (20 * 2.99792458e8) /3.

20 * 2.99792458e8=5.99584916e9.

Divide by 3: 5.99584916e9 /3 ≈1.998616387e9 m/s.

So, 1.998616387e9 m/s.

Now multiply by tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So 1.998616387e9 m/s *2.056875e-24 s = ?

Multiply the coefficients: 1.998616387 *2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

1.998616387 *2 =3.997232774.

1.998616387 *0.056875 ≈ let's compute:

0.05 *1.998616387 =0.09993081935.

0.006875 *1.998616387 = approximately 0.013732599.

So total 0.09993081935 +0.013732599≈0.113663418.

So total approx 3.997232774 +0.113663418=4.110896192.

So 4.110896192e-15 m.

Hmm, that's about 4.110896e-15 m, which is approximately 4.11e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15.

Hmm, but my calculation gives about 4.11e-15, which isn't any of the options exactly, but closest to option B (4.0655e-15). Did I make any mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of gamma is a bit off. Let me recalculate gamma more precisely.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So E² =64 GeV², m²=1.44 GeV².

p² = E² - m² =62.56 GeV².

p= sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

Beta = p/(E) =7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So beta=0.98875.

Then, gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

Compute beta²= (0.98875)^2.

0.98875^2 = (0.98 +0.00875)^2= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.00875 + (0.00875)^2.

0.98^2=0.9604.

2*0.98*0.00875= 0.01715.

(0.00875)^2=0.0000765625.

Adding up: 0.9604 +0.01715=0.97755 +0.0000765625=0.9776265625.

So 1 - beta²=1 -0.9776265625=0.0223734375.

sqrt(0.0223734375)=?

Let me compute sqrt(0.0223734375).

Since 0.15^2=0.0225, which is 0.0001265625 higher than 0.0223734375.

So 0.15^2= 0.0225 → let's find x such that x^2=0.0223734375.

x=0.15 - delta.

(0.15 - delta)^2=0.0225 - 0.3 delta + delta^2=0.0223734375.

Assuming delta is small, delta^2 can be neglected.

So 0.0225 -0.3 delta ≈0.0223734375 → 0.0225 -0.0223734375=0.3 delta → 0.0001265625=0.3 delta → delta=0.0001265625/0.3=0.000421875.

So x=0.15-0.000421875=0.149578125.

So sqrt(0.0223734375)=0.149578125.

So gamma=1/(0.149578125)=approx 6.6863.

Wait, 0.149578125 *6.6863 ≈1?

0.149578125 *6=0.89746875.

0.149578125 *0.6863≈0.1029.

Total ≈0.89746875 +0.1029=approx 1. So yes, gamma is approx 6.6863.

Earlier, I used gamma=6.6667 (exactly 20/3), but the more precise gamma is about 6.6863.

So let's recalculate L with gamma=6.6863.

So L=6.6863 * 3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but using exact c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

So c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

Compute:

gamma=6.6863.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.6863 * 2.99792458e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

First compute 6.6863 *2.99792458e8.

6.6863 * 2.99792458e8 = ?

Compute 6 * 2.99792458e8 =1.798754748e9.

0.6863 *2.99792458e8 = ?

0.6863 *3e8 ≈2.0589e8.

More accurately:

0.6863 *2.99792458e8 =?

Let me compute 0.6863 *2.99792458.

2.99792458 *0.6=1.798754748.

2.99792458 *0.08=0.2398339664.

2.99792458 *0.0063=0.018883700.

Adding them: 1.798754748 +0.2398339664=2.038588714 +0.0188837=2.057472414.

Multiply by 1e8: 2.057472414e8.

So total 6.6863 *2.99792458e8 = 1.798754748e9 +2.057472414e8 = 2.004501972e9 m/s.

So approximately 2.0045e9 m/s.

Now multiply by tau=2.056875e-24 s.

L=2.0045e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.0045 * 2.056875) e-15 m.

Compute 2.0045 *2.056875.

2 *2.056875=4.11375.

0.0045 *2.056875=0.009256.

So total ≈4.11375 +0.009256=4.123006.

So L≈4.123e-15 m.

Hmm, that's about 4.123e-15 m. Close to 4.12e-15 m.

But the options given are B:4.0655e-15, and C:5.0223e-15.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Or perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mean lifetime is calculated using the natural line width formula, but perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic lifetime, but I think I did that.

Wait, another approach: another formula for decay length is L = c * τ * gamma.

Wait, no, I think that's the same as what I calculated before.

Alternatively, perhaps the production energy is given, but the velocity is not along the direction of motion, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the velocity as being along the direction of motion, so the decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime multiplied by gamma.

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation in units.

Wait, let me recompute tau.

Gamma is in GeV, so tau is in s.

Gamma =0.32 GeV.

hbar=6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau= hbar/Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

So with that, the calculation seems correct.

But the options don't have 4.1e-15 m. The closest is option B:4.0655e-15.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

We had beta=0.98875, so beta^2=0.9776265625.

So 1 - beta^2=0.0223734375.

sqrt(0.0223734375)= 0.149578125.

So gamma=1/0.149578125=6.686358726.

So gamma=6.686358726.

Then, gamma*c=6.686358726 *2.99792458e8 m/s.

Compute that:

6 *2.99792458e8 =1.798754748e9.

0.686358726 *2.99792458e8 = ?

0.686358726 *2.99792458 = ?

Let me compute 0.686358726 * 2.99792458.

Using calculator approximation:

0.686358726 *3 =2.059076178.

But since it's 2.99792458, which is 3 -0.00207542.

So 0.686358726 * (3 -0.00207542) =0.686358726*3 -0.686358726*0.00207542.

=2.059076178 - 0.00142313 ≈2.057653048.

So 0.686358726 *2.99792458e8 =2.057653048e8 m/s.

So total gamma*c=1.798754748e9 +2.057653048e8=2.004520048e9 m/s.

Now, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=gamma*c*tau=2.004520048e9 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 2.004520048 *2.056875 = ?

Let me compute 2 *2.056875 =4.11375.

0.004520048 *2.056875 ≈0.00929.

So total ≈4.11375 +0.00929=4.12304.

So L≈4.12304e-15 meters.

So approximately 4.123e-15 m.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta, perhaps beta is lower.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given as Γ, and the mean lifetime is tau= ħ/(Γ), but perhaps I should use the total decay width, which is correct, because the particle's lifetime is determined by the total width.

Wait, but that's what I did. So no, that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the decay length is different. Let me think again. The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It's calculated as L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

But another way to write it is L = (c tau) * gamma, so perhaps I can compute c tau first, then multiply by gamma.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma=6.686358726.

So 6.170625e-16 *6.686358726 ≈?

Compute 6 *6.170625e-16=3.702375e-15.

0.686358726 *6.170625e-16 ≈4.241e-16.

Adding together: 3.702375e-15 +4.241e-16 =4.12648e-15 m.

Which is again about 4.126e-15 m.

But the options are B:4.0655e-15 and C:5.0223e-15. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the speed as v = beta*c, not multiply by gamma again.

Wait, no, because when you have gamma, the decay length is L=gamma * v * tau.

Wait, v =beta c. So L=gamma * beta c * tau.

Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, and the particle is moving at speed v=beta c. So the distance traveled is v * (gamma tau) )= beta c gamma tau.

Which is the same as gamma beta c tau.

Alternatively, gamma beta c tau.

Wait, I think that's the same as earlier, because gamma beta= (1/sqrt(1-beta^2)) * beta.

So perhaps I should compute beta*gamma.

Wait, beta=0.98875, gamma=6.686358726.

beta * gamma=0.98875 *6.686358726.

Compute that: 0.98875 *6=5.9325.

0.98875 *0.686358726≈0.98875 *0.6=0.59325, 0.98875*0.086358726≈0.0854.

So total approx 0.59325 +0.0854=0.67865.

So total beta*gamma≈5.9325 +0.67865=6.61115.

So beta gamma ≈6.61115.

So L= beta gamma c tau =6.61115 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.61115 *3e8=1.983345e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s →1.983345e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.983345 *2.056875) e-15.

Compute 1.983345 *2.056875.

1.983345 *2=3.96669.

1.983345 *0.056875≈0.1129.

So total approx 3.96669 +0.1129=4.07959.

So L≈4.07959e-15 m.

Ah, now that's closer to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the previous approach by not considering beta*gamma correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute L=beta gamma c tau.

Because, let me think: the mean decay length L is the product of the particle's velocity (v=beta c), its lifetime in the lab frame (gamma tau), and the proper time is tau. So:

L = v * (gamma tau) )= beta c gamma tau.

Which is same as beta gamma c tau.

So perhaps I should compute beta * gamma first.

With beta=0.98875, gamma=6.686358726.

So beta gamma=0.98875 *6.686358726.

Let me compute this exactly.

0.98875 *6.686358726.

Compute 0.98875 *6=5.9325.

0.98875 *0.686358726=?

Compute 0.98875 *0.6=0.59325.

0.98875 *0.086358726=?

0.98875 *0.08=0.0791.

0.98875 *0.006358726≈0.006293.

So 0.0791 +0.006293≈0.085393.

So 0.59325 +0.085393=0.678643.

So total beta gamma=5.9325 +0.678643=6.611143.

So beta gamma=6.611143.

Now, L= beta gamma c tau.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So:

L=6.611143 *2.99792458e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute:

First, 6.611143 *2.99792458e8 =?

Compute 6 *2.99792458e8=1.798754748e9.

0.611143 *2.99792458e8=?

0.6 *2.99792458e8=1.798754748e8.

0.011143 *2.99792458e8≈3.341e6 (approx 3,341,000).

So total=1.798754748e8 +3.341e6 ≈1.83216e8 m/s.

So, 6.611143 *2.99792458e8 =1.798754748e9 +1.83216e8 → wait, 1.79875e9 is 1,798,754,748 → plus 183,216,000 (approx) gives 1,981,970,748 → 1.981970748e9 m/s.

Now multiply by tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L =1.981970748e9 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

= (1.981970748 *2.056875) e-15 m.

Compute 1.981970748 *2.056875.

1.981970748 *2=3.963941496.

1.981970748 *0.056875≈0.112634.

Adding together: 3.963941496 +0.112634=4.076575.

So L≈4.076575e-15 m.

That's approximately 4.0766e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Hmm. There might be a slight discrepancy due to rounding errors. Perhaps the exact calculation would give option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for beta and gamma.

Another approach: perhaps using the relativistic expressions without approximating.

Compute beta = p/E = sqrt(E² - m²)/E.

Wait, since E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, p= sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

So p=7.91 GeV.

So beta =7.91 /8 =0.98875.

gamma= E/(m c²) → E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so gamma=8/(1.2)=6.666666667.

Wait, that's a simpler way.

Wait, because gamma =E/(m c²) → in natural units, E=gamma m, so gamma=E/m.

So gamma=8/1.2=6.666666667.

So gamma=6.666666667.

Then, beta= sqrt(1 - (m²/E² ))=sqrt(1- (1.44/64))=sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.988687 approximately.

So beta=0.988687.

Then, beta gamma=0.988687 *6.666666667.

Compute that:

0.988687 *6 =5.932122.

0.988687 *0.666666667 ≈0.988687 * (2/3)=approx 0.659125.

Total beta gamma=5.932122 +0.659125≈6.591247.

So beta gamma≈6.591247.

Then, L=beta gamma c tau.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.591247 *2.99792458e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute step by step.

6.591247 *2.99792458e8 =?

6 *2.99792458e8 =1.798754748e9.

0.591247 *2.99792458e8 = ?

0.5 *2.99792458e8=1.49896229e8.

0.091247 *2.99792458e8≈2.736e7.

So total=1.49896229e8 +2.736e7 =1.77262229e8.

So 6.591247 *2.99792458e8 =1.798754748e9 +1.77262229e8= 1.976016977e9 m/s.

Now, multiply by tau=2.056875e-24 s.

L=1.976016977e9 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 1.976016977 *2.056875.

1.976016977 *2 =3.952033954.

1.976016977 *0.056875≈0.111987.

Adding: 3.952033954 +0.111987≈4.06402.

So L≈4.06402e-15 m.

That's very close to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Ah, so now it matches option B.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5912.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma = 6.5912 \), \( c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.5912 \times 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, calculate \( 6.5912 \times 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5912 \times 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \approx 1.9760 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Now, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9760 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 4.064 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.064 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
