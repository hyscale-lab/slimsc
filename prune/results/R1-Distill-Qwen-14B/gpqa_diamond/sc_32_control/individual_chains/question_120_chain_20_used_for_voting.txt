Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me try to think it through. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in space. So, the density of stars doesn't change with distance. Hmm.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star at distance d has parallax plx = 1/d (but the exact units might vary, but the relationship holds).

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So if I take a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. But wait, how does the volume change with distance? Because when you consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr. So as you go further, the volume increases with d squared.

But how does this relate to parallax? Parallax plx is inversely proportional to d. So d = 1/plx. So if I have a small change in plx, dplx, what's the corresponding change in d? Let's see: d = 1/plx → dd = -1/(plx²) * dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx decreases (since parallax is smaller for more distant stars), d increases. But for the absolute change, maybe I can ignore the sign for now.

So the volume element for a thin shell at a given d is 4πd² dd. But here, the change in d is related to the change in plx. So substituting dd = -(1/plx²) dplx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, let me think again. Wait, no, I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, d is 1/plx, so d^2 is 1/plx². And dd is the change in d, which is (dd) = - (dplx)/(plx²). So plugging into the volume element:

Volume = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx²) * (-dplx/(plx²)) )

But since I'm looking for the number of stars, which is proportional to the volume, maybe the sign doesn't matter. So Volume is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) ) * dplx? Wait, that would be 1/plx^4 times dplx. Hmm. So the number of stars in a small dplx interval would be proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx.

Wait, but wait. Because the number of stars is the volume multiplied by the number density. Since the number density is uniform, say n stars per unit volume, then number of stars in the shell is n * 4π d² dd.

So number of stars = n * 4π (d)^2 (dd).

But substituting d=1/plx, and dd= -dplx/(plx^2), so:

number = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx^2)) ) = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx. So the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is asking about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for a given dplx, the number is 1/plx^4 * dplx. So the number per unit dplx is 1/plx^4.

Wait no, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So for each unit increase in plx, how does the number change? So it's the number per unit plx.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think in terms of probability distribution. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those parallaxes.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of a spherical shell at a distance d = 1/plx, with thickness dr corresponding to the change in distance from plx to plx + dplx.

Wait, let me calculate the difference in distance. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the distance for plx is d =1/plx, and for plx + dplx, it's d+dd, where dd is the change in distance.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d =1/plx. So if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d dplx) = (d^2) dplx. Because d =1/plx → plx =1/d → d d = -1/plx² dplx. So dd = -d^2 dplx.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the volume between two distances d1 and d2, which correspond to plx1 and plx2. The volume is (4/3)π (d2^3 - d1^3). So the differential volume for a small change in d is 4π d² dd.

But we want to express this in terms of plx. So d =1/plx → dd = -d^2 dplx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the volume element becomes 4π d² * (-1/plx^2) dplx.

But d =1/plx, so d² =1/plx^2. Plugging in:

Volume =4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) dplx ) → 4π (-1/plx^4) dplx.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, volume decreases, which makes sense because higher plx (smaller distance) means a smaller volume. But since we're interested in the magnitude, the volume is proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume element would be proportional to 1/plx^4 dplx. So the number per unit dplx is 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is phrased as: how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So for a given plx, when you have a small dplx, the number of stars in that range is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit dplx is 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx (since dplx is the unit) scales as 1/plx^4.

Wait no, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So if I take a unit increase in plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number density in plx space is 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options:

A) ~1/plx^4

B) ~1/plx^2

C) ~1/plx^1

D) ~1/plx^3

So the answer should be option A, ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax, distance, and the volume of spherical shells in space. 

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \), the volume is proportional to \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell. Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). The volume element in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \, d\text{plx} = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform number density of stars. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the options provided:

- **A) ~1/plx^4**: Matches the derived relationship.
- **B) ~1/plx^2**: Incorrect, as it does not account for the full dependence on parallax.
- **C) ~1/plx^1**: Incorrect, as it underestimates the dependence on parallax.
- **D) ~1/plx^3**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived relationship.

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax scales as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
