Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is broken into its components Px, Py, and Pz, each of which is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum operators, the total operator P is the sum of the components multiplied by the unit vectors in their respective directions. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? So the operator P would be P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the operator for the component along an arbitrary direction n is given by P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Oh, right, because the operator for a direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction cosines (which are n_x, n_y, n_z).

But wait, the problem says that the direction is lying in the x-z plane. So that means n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So n_y is zero. So the operator P along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the Py component is multiplied by n_y which is zero.

So the first step is to construct the matrix for P. Let me write down each component matrix.

Given:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component matrix is 2x2. So for P, which is along n, let's write it as:

P = (n_x (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]) ) + (n_z (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) )

Wait, but since the direction is n, and n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, perhaps? Because in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane would have θ measured from the z-axis. So yeah, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting those in, the operator P becomes:

P = (sinθ * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ * ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's compute each term.

First term: sinθ * ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ ħ/2], [sinθ ħ/2, 0]]

Second term: cosθ * ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ ħ/2, 0], [0, -cosθ ħ/2]]

Adding these together, the full matrix P is:

[ [cosθ ħ/2, sinθ ħ/2 ],
  [sinθ ħ/2, -cosθ ħ/2 ] ]

Wait, let me double-check. Because when you add the two, the (1,1) element is cosθ * ħ/2 from the second term and 0 from the first term, so yes. The (1,2) is sinθ * ħ/2. Similarly for the (2,1) element, it's sinθ * ħ/2. And the (2,2) element is -cosθ * ħ/2.

So the matrix P is:

ħ/2 * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
         [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. Yeah, because the first term has (0,1) and (1,0) scaled by sinθ, and the diagonal terms are from the P_z part scaled by cosθ. So yes.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So the equation simplifies to (since ħ/2 is a scalar factor, factor it out):

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * |ψ> = |ψ>

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is ħ/2. So the equation is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the scalar factor:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ]       [ a ]
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]   [ b ]   = [ a ]
                               [ b ]

Which gives us the system of equations:

a cosθ + b sinθ = a
a sinθ - b cosθ = b

Wait, that's two equations:

1) a cosθ + b sinθ = a
2) a sinθ - b cosθ = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

a cosθ + b sinθ - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

a sinθ - b cosθ - b = 0
a sinθ + b (-cosθ - 1) = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as a system:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a - (cosθ +1 ) b = 0

Let me write this as a matrix:

[ (cosθ - 1)    sinθ          ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ         -(cosθ +1) ] [b] 

Since the system has non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero. Let's compute the determinant:

D = (cosθ - 1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Simplify this:

= (-cosθ (cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1 )) - sin²θ
Wait, expanding:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1)
= -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ +1
= -cos²θ + 1

So D = (-cos²θ + 1) - sin²θ

But 1 - cos²θ is sin²θ, so D = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvalues.

So the system of equations is consistent, and we can find a non-trivial solution.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = (sinθ / (1 - cosθ)) b

Wait, let me compute (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Wait, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2)

So (sinθ)/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] = cot(theta/2)

Wait, perhaps it's better to write a in terms of b.

Let me compute:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, let's compute sinθ/(1 - cosθ). Let me use the identity:

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)

So:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] )= [cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

But let me represent this as a ratio. Let me let b = 1 (for simplicity), then a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but perhaps I can express the eigenvector in terms of theta. Let's proceed.

So the eigenvector components are proportional to a and b.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

But let's pick b = sin(theta/2), then a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

Wait, because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

So the components would be a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2).

Wait, that seems promising. So the eigenvector is proportional to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, let's check this with the equations. Let me substitute a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2) into equation 1.

Equation 1: a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

Substitute a and b:

cos(theta/2) (cosθ - 1) + sin(theta/2) sinθ = ?

Hmm, let's compute each term. Let's recall that cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2), so cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2).

So first term: cos(theta/2) * (-2 sin²(theta/2)) = -2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Second term: sin(theta/2) * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) = 2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So adding them: (-2 sin^2 cos) + (2 sin^2 cos) = 0. So equation 1 holds.

Similarly for equation 2:

a sinθ - b (cosθ +1) = 0

Substitute a and b:

cos(theta/2) sinθ - sin(theta/2) (cosθ +1 ) = ?

Again, using identities.

Let me compute each term.

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

cos(theta) + 1 = 2 cos²(theta/2)

So first term: cos(theta/2) * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

Second term: sin(theta/2) * 2 cos²(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

So equation becomes: 2 sin cos² - 2 sin cos² = 0. So equation 2 holds.

So the solution is a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2). So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So we need to make sure this vector is normalized.

Compute the norm squared: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1. So it's already normalized.

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → But since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, but not sure.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector, but since the operator is real, the eigenvectors are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. So perhaps the components are real.

Wait, but the options are given in terms of variables. Let me see:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait the options: Option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which would be option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ into the expression for $P$, the matrix for $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$, which simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0, \quad a \sin\theta - b (\cos\theta + 1) = 0.
\]

Solving these equations, the eigenvector components are found to be proportional to:

\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

The norm of the eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it involves $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which do not match the derived components.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived components $\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$ and $\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and modifies the components.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
