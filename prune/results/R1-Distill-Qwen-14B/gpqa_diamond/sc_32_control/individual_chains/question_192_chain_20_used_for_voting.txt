Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center. So imagine, like, a big sphere with a smaller hollow part not exactly at the center but shifted a bit.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. 

Wait, I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then a charge is placed inside the cavity, I think the conductor will redistribute charges. Oh right, when a charge is placed inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface remains neutral because the total charge of the conductor is zero. Or wait, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface would have a charge of +q, because the inner has -q. No, wait, no. Let me think again.

The conductor is neutral. When you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must induce a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q. Because the inner is -q, the outer must be +q to balance, so the total remains zero.

But wait, wait. The conductor is initially neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must be +q. That makes sense.

So, now, when outside the conductor (like point P), the electric field due to the charges inside the conductor would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is the same as if the charge were a point at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the outer surface has +q. So the electric field outside the conductor (radius R) would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q_enclosed)/(L²). So q_enclosed here is the +q on the outer surface of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field at P should depend only on the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface that includes P. The Gaussian surface is a sphere of radius L, which encloses everything inside, including the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor. The inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge outside the conductor is +q. So when considering fields outside the conductor, the field is as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center.

Wait, but the options don't all have L² in the denominator. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is (q)/(L²), which would match this. Option D is (q)/(l²), which would imply the field is calculated based on l, the distance from the cavity's center. But wait, no, because the field outside the conductor depends on the conductor's outer charge, which is at the conductor's center.

Wait, but wait, the conductor's outer shell has a charge of +q, so the field outside the conductor (radius R) is as if +q is at the center. So regardless of where point P is, as long as it's outside, the field due to the conductor's charges is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P. That would be option B.

Wait, but another thought: the setup includes the cavity, and the position of the charge is inside the cavity but shifted. Does that affect the field outside the conductor? Because the conductor's charges would adjust, but the net effect on the external field should just depend on the total charge. Because for a spherical conductor, the external field is as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the conductor is conducting, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces would arrange themselves spherically symmetrically on the surfaces. The inner surface would be a shell of charge -q, and the outer would be +q, but the outer is a shell, so regardless of where you are outside the conductor, the field depends only on the total charge of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor was initially neutral, so the inner surface has -q (induced by the +q in the cavity), and the outer surface must then have +q to make the total charge zero? No, wait. The conductor's total charge is initially zero. The charge in the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. So the conductor's total charge is the sum of the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, conductor's charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer must be +q. So the total is zero. So the outer surface has +q.

So when you're outside the conductor, the field is from the +q on the outer surface, as if it's a point charge at the center. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed (like, say, it's shifted, so l, s, and theta are involved), the external field only depends on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the position of the charge affects the induced charges in a way that the outer surface isn't spherical? No, wait, because the conductor is a sphere, so the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves spherically symmetrically regardless of the internal charge's position. Because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charge would induce charges on the inner surface, but the outer surface would just have a uniform charge distribution.

So yes, the field outside the conductor is as if the charge is at the center.

So for point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor. So that would be option B.

Wait, but why are other options present? Let's think about the other possibilities.

Option A: (q)/(l - s cosθ)^2. Hmm, l is the distance from the cavity's center to P. But the cavity's center isn't the same as the conductor's center. So perhaps someone might think to use the distance from the charge's location? But no, the field outside the conductor depends on the charge on the outer surface, which is at the conductor's center.

Option C: (q)/(l + s cosθ)^2. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option D: (q)/(l²). That would be the field if the charge was at the center of the cavity, but since the conductor's charge is at its own center, it's E proportional to L², not l².

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor is $+q$, and it acts as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor due to the spherical symmetry of the charge distribution.

3. **Field at Point $P$**: The point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is therefore given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This result is independent of the position of the charge inside the cavity or the geometry of the cavity itself, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $l - s \cos\theta$, which is unrelated to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $l + s \cos\theta$, which is not relevant to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The field does not depend on $l^2$, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
