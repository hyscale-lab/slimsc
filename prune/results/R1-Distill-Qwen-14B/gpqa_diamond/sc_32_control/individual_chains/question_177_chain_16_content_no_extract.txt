Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Additionally, their radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume they radiate as black bodies and compute the luminosity difference.

Wait, the question is asking by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. So, I need to find L1 / L2.

I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Oh, but wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because T = b / λ_max. So T1 = T2.

Wait, no, is that right? If λ_max is the same, then T = same for both. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if the peaks are the same, T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so maybe it's not moving relative to us, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So, the observed wavelength would be different if the star is moving towards or away from us. But the question says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. Hmm, so perhaps the observed λ_max is same, but the intrinsic λ_max (temperature) could be different. 

Wait, that complicates things. Because the actual temperature of each star could be different, but when observed, their λ_max as measured is same because of the Doppler shift. 

So, because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest × sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light. But wait, the formula I remember is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), but that's a linear approximation and only valid when v<<c. But if the velocities are significant (like 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light), maybe the approximation isn't so good. Alternatively, using the relativistic Doppler shift formula: λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, someone corrects for radial velocity when measuring temperature, so perhaps the actual temperature is adjusted by the Doppler effect. 

This might be a point of confusion. Let's see: the peak wavelength (λ_max) is observed. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But the actual λ_max (and hence T) of each star is different because of their velocities.

Wait, but how? Let me think. Let's denote:

λ_observed for Star_1 = λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r is 0, so no Doppler shift)
λ_observed for Star_2 = λ2_obs = λ2_rest × (1 + v_r2 / c) approximately, assuming v_r2 is positive (moving away). Since Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, which is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r is zero). For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest × (1 + v_r2/c) if moving away. Alternatively, if moving towards us, it would be (1 - v_r2/c), but since the velocity is positive 700, maybe it's moving away. So, let me compute that.

Wait, wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest × (1 + v/c). For speeds much less than c, this is a good approximation. So, if Star_2 is moving away at v = 700 km/s, then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, and λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r1=0), then:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Dividing both sides by b, we get 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that could be a key point. So the intrinsic temperatures are different.

Let me compute v2 in terms of c.

v2 is 700 km/s. c is about 3e5 km/s. So v2/c is 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333... approximately 0.233%.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333 + ... ), using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So T1 ≈ T2 * (0.9976667).

So the temperatures are almost the same, but slightly different.

But wait, since the problem is about the ratio of luminosities, perhaps the Doppler effect introduces a small correction. But the options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, which suggests that the ratio is about 2.25 or higher.

Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's first write down the formula for luminosity.

L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

So the (R factors) contribute a factor of 2.25. But the T factors have to be considered as well.

From earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c) → (T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v2/c) ≈ 1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.997666.

Then (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997666)^4 ≈ Let's compute that.

First, 0.997666 is approximately 1 - 0.002334.

So (1 - 0.002334)^4.

Using binomial approximation: (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - n x.

n=4, x=0.002334.

So (1 - 4*0.002334) = 1 - 0.009336 ≈ 0.990664.

Wait, but actually, maybe a better way is to compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.997666^4:

0.997666^2 = (approx) 0.997666 * 0.997666.

Compute 0.997666 * 0.997666:

= (1 - 0.002334) * (1 - 0.002334) = 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2.

= 1 - 0.004668 + (0.000005448).

≈ 0.995336448.

Then square that to get to the 4th power:

(0.995336448)^2 ≈ ?

Again, expand:

= (1 - 0.004663552)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004663552 + (0.004663552)^2.

= 1 - 0.009327104 + 0.00002175.

≈ 0.990698646.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, putting it together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, wait. So 2.25 multiplied by approximately 0.9907 is roughly 2.227. So around 2.23.

Looking at the options, D is ~2.23.

But wait, wait a minute. Did I miscalculate the T ratio?

Wait, because in the Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is the same. So, let me re-examine the relation between the temperatures.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the relation between T1 and T2. Let me think again.

The observed peak wavelength λ_obs is the same for both stars. For Star_1, since it's not moving, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, which is moving away at velocity v_r2 = 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is λ_obs2 = (λ_rest2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ), but if v_r2 is much less than c, the approximation λ_obs2 ≈ λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c) holds.

Wait, or is it the other way around? The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), correct?

So, for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, and λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2,

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c)/T2 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

Which is what I had before. So, T1 = T2 / (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) = T2 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333) → approximately 0.997667 T2.

So, (T1/T2) is 0.997667, so to the fourth power is approximately 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 → (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but the options include A) ~2.25, which is the R^2 factor alone, but they probably included the Doppler effect which reduces it slightly. So the correct answer is D, ~2.23.

But wait, what if the Doppler effect was applied in a different way? Like considering the actual temperature shift due to velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the observed temperature is different. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so it appears hotter, and if moving away, it's redshifted, appearing cooler.

So in the case of Star_2 moving away, its observed temperature would be lower than its actual temperature. But wait, no, the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: the observed wavelengths are the same, so their observed temperatures are the same. Because T = b/λ_obs.

Wait, that can't be right because Star_2 is moving away, but they observed the same λ_max. So that would imply that their observed temperatures are the same. So T_obs1 = T_obs2.

Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier approach. Let me think again.

If both stars have the same observed λ_max, then their observed temperatures are the same. Because T = b/λ_obs. So T_obs1 = T_obs2.

So for Star_1, which has v_r1 = 0, T_obs1 = T1.

For Star_2, which has v_r2 = 700 km/s, but is moving away, its observed temperature would be lower than its actual temperature. But since T_obs2 = T_obs1, perhaps T_obs2 is lower than T2.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let's clarify.

The observed temperature is T_obs = T * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) for relativistic Doppler shift when the source is moving away. Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for temperature shift.

Alternatively, the observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest of the star. So, for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), because it's moving away. We know λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_rest1 = b / T1 and λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Alternatively, T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Hmm, now this is different from before. Because earlier I used the linear approximation, but perhaps I should use the exact formula.

So with v =700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s, but wait, no, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s? Wait, 700 km = 7e5 meters. 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v/c = (7e5) / (3e8) ) = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.002333.

So, (1 - v/c) ≈ 0.997667, (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.995336.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.995336) ≈ 0.997666.

So,

T1 / T2 ≈ 0.997666.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.997666)^4 ≈ as computed earlier approximately 0.9907.

So then L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual temperatures are different, how does that affect the calculation of luminosity?

We're told to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So their intrinsic luminosity depends on their actual temperature and radius.

So, L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So, when the problem says that the calculated luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor, they are comparing their actual luminosities, not the observed ones. Because the observed flux would be affected by distance, but the problem doesn't mention distance. So perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature but the actual temperature is what matters for luminosity.

Wait, but no, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming they radiate as black bodies. So they must have used the actual temperatures of the stars, not the observed.

Wait, but how do they determine the actual temperature of the stars? Because if a star is moving, the observed spectrum is Doppler shifted. So, to get the actual temperature, the astronomer would correct for the Doppler shift.

So, for Star_1, since it's not moving, its observed spectrum is the same as its rest frame, so T1 is determined directly as T_obs1.

For Star_2, its spectrum is redshifted, so the astronomer would measure a lower observed temperature, but knowing that it's moving away, they would correct for the Doppler effect to find the actual T2.

But in this problem, it says that the peaks are at the same wavelength. So, the observed λ_max is same for both. But when calculating luminosity, they would use the actual T (corrected for Doppler shift) and R.

So, using the actual T1 and T2, which are different because of their velocities.

Wait, but earlier calculation leads to L1/L2 ~2.23.

But let me re-derive this to make sure.

Given:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1 = 1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 and T2: earlier, from the Doppler shift.

Wait, but if the observed λ_max is the same, then the observed temperatures are the same. So, T_obs1 = T_obs2.

But T_obs is related to the actual T by the Doppler shift. So, T_obs = T * (1 + v_r / c) for non-relativistic speeds when moving away. Wait, no, actually, the Doppler shift for temperature would be reciprocal. Because if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), which implies the observed temperature is lower.

Wait, the Doppler effect for temperature can be approximated as T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) for a star moving away.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Because temperature is inversely related to wavelength. So, if the star's light is redshifted (longer wavelength), the observed temperature would be lower than the rest frame temperature.

So, since Star_1's observed temperature is T_obs1 = T1.

Star_2's observed temperature is T_obs2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so the observed temperatures are the same (T_obs1 = T_obs2 = T_obs).

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = T_obs.

So,

T2 = T_obs / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = T_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

So,

T1 = T_obs,

T2 = T_obs * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = ( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )^2.

So, numerically, (v/c)=0.002333.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.995336.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.995336)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23, so the correct option is D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So, the answer is D) ~2.23.

But wait, wait another moment. Because the actual calculation might require using the exact Doppler shift formula, not the approximation.

Let me compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) without approximation.

v =700 km/s =7e5 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.00233333...

So,

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666667,

(1 + v/c) = 1.002333333.

Dividing these:

0.997666667 / 1.002333333 ≈ Let's compute it exactly.

0.997666667 ÷ 1.002333333.

Let me compute this division.

1.002333333 × 0.995336 = ?

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Compute 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

Well, 1.002333333 is approximately 1.002333.

So,

Approximately, 0.9976667 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.995336.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.995336) ≈ 0.997666.

So, (T1/T2) is 0.997666, (T1/T2)^4 is approximately 0.9907.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227, which is about 2.23.

Thus, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Contribution
The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \implies \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Contribution
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, the observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted. Assuming non-relativistic speeds, the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}
\]

Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.997667)^4
\]

Using the binomial approximation for small \(x\), where \(x = 1 - 0.997667 = 0.002333\):

\[
(1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x
\]

\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009332 = 0.990668
\]

### Step 4: Combine Results
Substitute the values into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.990668 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 5: Match to Options
The closest option to \(2.227\) is:

**D) ~2.23**

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{D}}
\]
