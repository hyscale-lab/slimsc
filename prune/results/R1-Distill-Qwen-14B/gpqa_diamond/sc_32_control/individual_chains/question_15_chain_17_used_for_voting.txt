Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. 

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses are known. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because according to Kepler's laws, closer planets orbit faster.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not bigger in radius. That probably affects the probability because the star's size matters in the transit probability.

I need to find out which planet has a higher chance of transiting. I think the transit probability depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. Wait, more specifically, the probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how do we calculate that?

I remember that the probability P is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's more like (2R_star / a) times something else? Or perhaps the formula is (R_planet + R_star) / a, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital size relative to the star. More accurately, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's approximated by R_star / a. But wait, actually, the formula I'm trying to recall is the geometric probability. Oh right, the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_s + R_p) / a, where R_s is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius, and a the semi-major axis (the distance from the star). But since Earth-like planets have R_p much smaller than R_s, we can approximate it as R_s / a.

So the probability for each planet is proportional to R_s / a. Wait, but the star's radius is the same for both, because the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is same for both. So the probability is inversely proportional to a, the semi-major axis.

Wait, but wait. The period is related to a via Kepler's third law. The law says that P² is proportional to a³ / (M_star), where M_star is the mass of the star. So a³ = (G*M_star * P²)/(4π²), but here we can think of a as proportional to (P² * M_star)^(1/3).

So, for Planet_1, P1 = P2 / 3. Because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. And M1 = 2 * M2. 

So let's compute a1 and a2. 

For a1: a1 ∝ (P1² * M1)^(1/3) = ( ( (P2/3)² ) * 2 M2 )^(1/3) 

= ( (P2² * 2 M2) ) / 9 )^(1/3) 

= [ (2/9) P2² M2 ) ]^(1/3)

For a2: a2 ∝ (P2² * M2)^(1/3) 

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ (2/9) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) 

Calculating 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a1 ≈ 0.6 * a2. 

But since the transit probability is inversely proportional to a, the probability P is proportional to 1/a. So P1 ~ 1/a1, P2 ~ 1/a2. 

So P1 / P2 = (a2) / (a1) = (a2) / (0.6 a2) )= 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666... So P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, because the probability is R_s/(a). Since R_s is same for both, P is proportional to 1/a. So if a1 is smaller than a2, then P1 is higher.

Wait, because a is the semi-major axis. So if a1 is smaller, 1/a1 is larger. So P1 is higher than P2 by a factor of (a2)/(a1) = 1/(0.6) = approx 1.666.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.67 times higher than Planet_2.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation.

a1 = [ (P1^2 * M1) ]^(1/3) 

But P1 = P2 /3, M1 = 2*M2.

So a1 = [ ( (P2/3)^2 * 2 M2 ) ]^(1/3)

= [ ( (P2^2 * 2 M2) ) / 9 ) ]^(1/3)

= [ (2/9) * (P2^2 M2) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 is [ (P2^2 M2) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) * a2 

So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2.

Compute 2/9: 2 ÷9 ≈ 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

Therefore, P1 is (R_s/a1) = R_s / (0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R_s/a2) ) = 1.666... * P2.

So P1 is about 1.666 times as likely to transit as P2.

So which planet is better for transit? Planet_1 has higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which doesn't match.

So the correct option is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_s}{a} \), where \( R_s \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \). 

The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_s \) via Kepler's third law: 

\[
a \propto \left( P^2 M_s \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_1, the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), and the host star's mass is \( M_{s1} = 2M_{s2} \). Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto \left( \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 (2M_{s2}) \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} P_2^2 M_{s2} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:

\[
a_2 \propto \left( P_2^2 M_{s2} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.6 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6a_2} \approx 1.67 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2} = 1.67P_2.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Among the options, this matches Option C.
