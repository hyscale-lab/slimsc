Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about the radial velocity (RV) method.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's orbit. The star moves in response to the planet's gravity, and this movement shifts the wavelength of the spectral lines. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the question says both stars are similar to the Sun, so their masses are the same. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is a gas giant, but Neptune is less massive than Jupiter. So, the planet masses are the same for both, I think.

The question gives the periodic shifts for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms. Oh, wait, but the RV shift depends on the star's velocity, right? So the velocity semi-amplitude K is what causes the shift. The formula I remember is K = (v*sin i) where v is the velocity and i is the inclination angle. But I think for circular orbits, i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1, so K is v.

Wait, but how is the Doppler shift related to velocity? Oh, right, the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So the shift in wavelength is delta_lambda = lambda * (v/c). But wait, in the RV method, they measure the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum speed of the star towards or away from us.

So the spectral line shift (the periodic shift) is proportional to the velocity K. So if Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms and Planet #2's is 7, that means K is higher for Planet #2. But how does K relate to the orbital period and the planet's mass?

The formula for K is something like K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) / ( (2π G)^ (1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the simplified version when M_p << M_star (which is the case here since Neptune's mass is way less than the star, which is like the Sun). So then the formula should simplify.

I remember the formula for K when M_p is much smaller than M_star:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π G)^(1/3) )) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the more precise formula. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sin i) * ( (P/(1 year)) )^(-1/3) ) * something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But if M_p << M_star, then M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and sin i is approximately 1 (since we observe circular orbits and edge-on, which is the case for maximum signal). Also, e=0 for circular orbits. So this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about that exact expression. Maybe another way to think about it: The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a relationship between K and the orbital period P. Since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass (solar-like), the only varying factors are K and P.

Wait, the problem states that both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2.

So the formula for K would be proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(-1/3) * other constants.

Wait, no, let me re-express the formula correctly. The formula I think is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (4 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1)/(P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the proportionality.

Since M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same, then K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K1 is the velocity for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, no. Let me see. Let me write the formula correctly.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since e=0, and M_p is same, and M_star is same, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, so K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K^(3).

Wait, if K doubles, P becomes 1/(2^3) = 1/8 of original. Wait, no, because K and P have an inverse relationship. Let's think.

If K1 is greater than K2, then P2 would be greater than P1. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K1 = (something) / P1^(1/3), K2 = same something / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write it as:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) → (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

So, P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

Wait, that's approximately 0.36. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So the ratio is P2/P1 = ~0.36 times. So it's shorter. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times planet #1's.

Wait, but that would mean that P2 is shorter, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's orbital period is shorter, so it's not longer. Hmm, perhaps I mixed up K1 and K2.

Wait, let me double-check. The problem states that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms and for #2 is 7. So, the velocity (K) is higher for planet #2. Because a larger shift implies higher velocity.

Wait, how does K relate to the Doppler shift? The Doppler shift delta_lambda is proportional to K. So if planet #2 has a larger shift, that implies higher K. So K2 > K1.

So K2 = 7, K1 =5.

Wait, then using the formula:

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → K2 = (something) / P2^(1/3), K1 = same something / P1^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3) → (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So, plugging in K1=5, K2=7:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 → (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? It's asking for P2/P1, which is ~0.36 times. So, it's about 0.36 times as long. So planet #2's period is shorter. Which means that the ratio is less than 1. So the answer is approximately 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity \( K \). For circular orbits and edge-on inclination (\( \sin i = 1 \)), \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the proportionality simplifies to:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, the spectral line shifts correspond to \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **approximately 0.36 times**.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
