Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let's see what it's about. So, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars N ~ 1 / plx^5. But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance. So I should probably express parallax in terms of distance and then relate N to distance.

I think the formula relating parallax to distance is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or was it plx in arcseconds and d in parsecs? Oh right, yeah, the parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / d (in parsecs). So d = 1 / plx.

Let me write that down: d = 1 / plx. So plx = 1/d.

Now, substituting plx into the given equation for N. So N ~ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx as 1/d, that becomes N ~ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that is d^5.

Wait, so N ~ d^5? But wait, that can't be right. Because higher d means more stars? So as distance increases, the number of stars increases a lot, like d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, the question says, how does the number of stars in that region change with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Oh, so maybe it's the number density or the number per unit volume or something?

Wait, no, the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So if N ~ d^5, then at a larger distance, more stars. But that doesn't make sense intuitively because if you look further away, you should see more stars, but each star is dimmer. Or wait, no, the question is about the number varying with parallax as 1/plx^5, so perhaps they're considering some kind of density.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the volume. When you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away you're looking. For a given volume, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume. But in this case, the relation is given as N proportional to 1/plx^5.

Let me clarify: Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So 1/plx = d.

So N = k * (1/plx)^5 = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases rapidly.

But wait, the options are about how N changes with distance. The options are in terms of r, not d. Oh, wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit distance interval, not the total number.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So the total number depends on the volume, but perhaps the question is about the differential number, like the number of stars per unit distance (like a density or a count per parsec).

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So N ~ d^5. So for a given range dr, the number of stars would be d^5 dr. So if you go from d to d + dr, the number is proportional to d^5 dr. So the number per unit distance would be proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number changes with distance. So for each unit of distance (like per parsec), the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So the number increases rapidly with distance.

Wait, but that doesn't quite fit. Let me think again. The number of stars N in a region varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Parallax is 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So N ~ d^5.

But wait, why would the number of stars increase so rapidly with distance? That doesn't make sense. Because as you look further away, the density of stars (number per volume) would decrease, but perhaps the overall number in a fixed solid angle increases because you're looking at a larger volume. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. So, the number density. Because if you have a larger volume, you can have more stars, but the number per unit volume depends on the distribution.

Wait, but the given relation is N proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d. So 1/plx is d, so N ~ d^5. So the total number N is increasing as d^5. So for a fixed region of the sky (fixed solid angle), the number of stars you can observe up to a distance d is proportional to d^5. That seems quite a steep increase, but that's what the question states.

But the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps it's the differential, dN/dr.

Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr = 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. But looking at the options, like option C is ~r^4.

Wait, the options are in terms of r, not d. So substituting d for r, which is the distance.

So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C, ~r^4.

Wait, but I thought the question was about the number of stars as a function of distance, not the differential. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.

Let me think about the relationship between the number of stars and distance. Suppose you have a region of the sky and you're counting stars within a certain distance. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, that's N proportional to d^5.

But if you're considering how the number changes as you move to a slightly larger distance (i.e., the derivative), then dN/dr would be 5 d^4, which is option C.

But wait, the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So per unit distance, which would be the derivative. So the change is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r. So the number in a thin shell (dN) would be proportional to the area times the thickness. Area depends on solid angle, but for a fixed region, it's a constant. So dN is proportional to (dA) * (dr). Wait, no, wait: the number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πr²) times the number density (stars per volume) times dr. Wait, that might be a more accurate approach.

Wait, but the given is N ~ 1/plx^5, which is N ~ d^5. So perhaps the number of stars within a certain distance d is N = k d^5. So when you look up to a distance d, you have k d^5 stars. So the total number up to d is N = k d^5.

If you want the number of stars per unit distance, you'd take the derivative dN/dr = 5 k d^4. So the number of stars in a thin shell dr at distance r is proportional to r^4. So per unit distance, it's r^4. So the answer would be option C, ~r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4, which matches this conclusion.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, we find \( N \sim d^5 \), meaning the total number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), or the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \). Taking the derivative of \( N \sim d^5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \sim 5d^4.
\]

Since \( d \) is the distance, we can replace it with \( r \), leading to:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \sim r^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the options provided, this corresponds to option C.
