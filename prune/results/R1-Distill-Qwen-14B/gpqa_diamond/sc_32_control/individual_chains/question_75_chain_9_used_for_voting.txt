Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein. They want to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

They're using a plasmid construct and transfecting it into Chinese hamster ovary cells, using Lipofectamine. After selecting the antibiotic-resistant colonies, they test the expression but can't overexpress the protein as expected. So, the problem must be somewhere in the construct or the expression process.

The question gives the sequence of the plus strand of their construct. Let me look at that sequence. The beginning is the start codon, which is ATG. Then it continues with some codons. Wait, the sequence goes on, and I notice that towards the end, there's a TGA. Wait, TGA is a stop codon, right? So let me think about the sequence.

The coding sequence provided starts with ATG and ends with TGA at the end. But wait, looking more carefully, how does the sequence end? Let me check the very end. The last part is ...GAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'. So the last part before the stop is ... TGA. So the actual coding sequence includes the stop codon TGA at the end.

Wait, but in the construct, they introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. So that's probably before the GADD45G coding sequence. So the construct would have the HA sequence, followed by GADD45G. When they express it, the HA tag is at the beginning, then the GADD45G protein.

But the problem is that they can't overexpress the protein. So why isn't the protein being expressed properly?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That could cause the HA tag not to be properly formed, but would that prevent the entire protein from being expressed? Maybe, but missense mutations usually affect structure but not necessarily prevent translation. Unless the mutation is in a critical site.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. How would that happen? If there's a stop codon upstream in the sequence. So if the ribosome hits a stop codon before the end, it would terminate early. Looking at the construct, perhaps the HA tag is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, but if there's a premature stop codon, the ribosome would stop before the GADD45G is fully translated.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker sequence usually refers to a short amino acid sequence that separates the tag (like HA) from the target protein. If there's no linker, maybe the HA tag is directly fused to the GADD45G. But would that cause proteolysis? Maybe if the tag is recognized by proteases, but I'm not sure. Also, the problem here is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's being broken down.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, but UAA is a standard stop codon. All cells have tRNA that recognize stop codons, but wait, no, actually, there are no tRNAs for stop codons. The ribosome doesn't need a tRNA for stop codons because it's a termination signal. So this option seems incorrect. The ribosome doesn't require a tRNA when it hits a stop codon; it just releases the protein. So maybe D is not the right answer.

Wait, looking again at the construct, the sequence ends with TGA (which is a stop codon, but in the mRNA, that's UAA). But wait, the construct is the coding sequence, so the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So the stop codon is UAA. But the problem is that in the construct, the GADD45G coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So when the ribosome translates, it would stop at that point. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, meaning the HA coding sequence is before the GADD45G. So the entire construct is a fusion protein of HA and GADD45G. So the HA would be at the beginning, followed by GADD45G, and the stop codon at the end.

Wait, but if the entire construct is HA followed by GADD45G, and the stop codon is after GADD45G, then the ribosome would translate the entire thing into a single protein: HA-GADD45G.

But wait, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So maybe the construct is introducing a premature stop codon within the coding sequence.

Looking at the given sequence, let me check if there are any other stop codons in the middle. Let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA within the sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

The beginning is ATG (start). Then TAC (tyrosine), CCATACGATGTT (various amino acids). Let's see some key points.

Wait, I can scan through the sequence for any occurrence of TAG, TAA, or TGA. Let's see.

Looking in the middle, for example, after the start codon, the next part is TAC (tyr), then CCATACGATGTT (maybe some glycine, alanine, etc.). Then CCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA (which would be a stop codon), I see that in the middle, perhaps some sequences. Wait, let's check for any TGA triplet.

Looking in the latter part, near the end. Let me check the last part again. The sequence ends with ... TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. But that's the intended stop at the end of the coding sequence, so that's correct.

Wait, but looking through, is there any TGA before that? Let me go through the sequence:

Looking for "TGA" in the sequence. Let's see:

The sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for the triplet TGA. Let's see:

After the start codon, the next part is TAC (tyr), then CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking at the part after the start, let's see:

Looking for TGA. Let me scan the sequence:

Around position where ATG is the start, then TAC, etc. Let me count letters, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the stop codon is at the end and that's correct, but perhaps the construct has an early stop codon before the end.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is being added as a separate sequence, but in the construct, if the HA is not followed by the correct start codon, or if there's a frame shift, that could cause a premature stop.

Wait, but the user says they introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. So the HA sequence is part of the coding sequence before GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence includes a stop codon or a frame shift. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is in the wrong frame, leading to a premature stop.

Wait, but the user is using the coding sequence for GADD45G and adding the HA at the N-terminus. So the entire coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G. So the entire mRNA is HA-GADD45G, with a stop at the end.

But if the HA tag includes a stop codon, or if the GADD45G coding sequence has a stop codon before the end, then the protein would terminate early.

Wait, looking at the provided sequence, does the HA sequence itself contain a stop codon? Let me think. The HA antigenic determinant is a short peptide, maybe around 15 amino acids. Its coding sequence would be a short DNA sequence. But the user modified the construct by adding HA to the N-terminus of GADD45G. So perhaps the HA coding is before the GADD45G coding.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the HA coding would be part of this sequence. Let me check if any of the codons in the HA are causing a premature stop.

Wait, perhaps the way the HA was added caused a frame shift, leading to a premature stop. For example, if the HA sequence is not in frame with the GADD45G, that would cause a frame shift and a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence was added correctly, but the mRNA has a stop codon within the HA.

But the problem is that the overall construct is not working. So the person is observing that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So possible issues are either the construct has a premature stop codon, or the expression is being terminated early.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if the mRNA has a stop codon before the intended end.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But that's not correct because the ribosome doesn't need a tRNA for stop codons. So D is out.

Option C suggests a lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the linker is missing, perhaps the HA tag and the GADD45G are directly joined, but proteolysis would cleave the protein, not prevent its expression. They're not expressing it, so more likely it's a problem with translation, not protein stability.

Option A is about a missense in the HA sequence. That would affect the HA epitope but might not stop translation entirely. Unless the mutation caused a frameshift or a premature stop.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence would be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA has a premature stop, the entire construct would be small, but in the given sequence, the stop is at the end. So perhaps the HA is correctly added without a stop, but the GADD45G sequence is correct.

Wait, but the problem is in the sequence provided. Let me look again for any TGA within the sequence before the last part.

Looking for the TGA in the sequence:

Looking for triplets:

Looking through the sequence:

After the start codon, we have TAC (tyr), then CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, looking for TGA. Let me check each codon. At position where letters 33-35 are TAC, then 36-38 are CCA, etc. Wait, maybe I can look for any TGA in the first part.

Wait, in the middle, I see 'GAAGT' which is GAA (glu) and then G T. No TGA there.

Wait, further on: ...ACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA in the middle. Let me see: ...TGAACGTGGA... So that's TGA followed by ACGTGGAC. So TGA is at position where the letters are T-G-A-A..., so that's TGA at position where the triplet is T-G-A.

Wait, so the sequence has TGA in the middle, right? Let me see:

Looking at this part: ...GAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC...

Breaking it down: the triplet before GAAGT is GG T (from GGA), then GAAGT is GAA G T, so the next triplet is GAG (GAA G...). Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual triplet.

Wait, the substring is ...GAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC...

Let me split into triplets:

GAAGTCT TGAACGT GGA... 

So the triplet TGA is present here. So TGA is the third triplet in this part: GAAGTCT is the first three, then TGA is the next triplet. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct has a premature stop codon in the middle, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early. So the GADD45G coding sequence is only partially expressed, so the protein isn't overexpressed.

So why is there a TGA in the middle? That would be a premature stop codon. That could be due to a mutation introduced during the construct's creation. So perhaps when the HA sequence was added, a mutation occurred that introduced a TGA in the coding sequence before the intended end.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if the mRNA has a premature stop codon. So in this case, the construct has a TGA in the middle, causing the ribosome to stop before the end, thus not producing the full-length protein. So the observed result is that the protein isn't overexpressed because it's not fully made.

So the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus. The provided sequence of the plus strand shows that the coding sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and ends with the stop codon (TGA). However, a detailed examination of the sequence reveals a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence, specifically in the region: `...GAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC...`. This premature stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence could affect the HA tag's structure, but it would not necessarily prevent the entire protein from being translated. This option does not explain the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B:** The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized. This matches the observed issue.
- **Option C:** A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but the problem here is the absence of protein expression, not its degradation. This option is incorrect.
- **Option D:** The tRNA for the stop codon (UAA) is not relevant because stop codons are termination signals and do not require tRNAs. This option is incorrect.

The most likely cause of the issue is the premature stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, which terminates translation early. This aligns with **Option B**.

Answer: B
