Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see... I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics. I have to use Einstein's theory of relativity. 

Wait, the problem gives the astronauts' masses as 2m and 3m traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Oh wait, the question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Right.

First, I think I need to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, I guess I subtract their velocities? But wait, no, because in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. Oh right, I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ). Oh wait, but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity of the 3m astronaut (moving slower) from the 2m astronaut's frame would be (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1 c) / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857. So that's about 0.1428 c. Wait, looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and option D also 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, right? The total energy would be the sum of their energies.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36). Let me compute that. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so substituting into E = gamma * m_total * c². So for the first, 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c²? Hmm, but wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the formula is E = gamma * m c², where m is rest mass. So for the first astronaut, m is 2m, so E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c². Gamma1 is 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, the second astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Compute gamma for that. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). What is sqrt(0.75)? Well sqrt(3/4) is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma2 is approximately 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding these two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Now looking at the options. Option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B says E=4.96. So the total energy is around 5.96 mc².

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Gamma1: 0.6c, so (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1 -0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma1 is 1.25. E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 mc².

Gamma2: (0.5)^2 is 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75, sqrt is about 0.8660. So gamma2 is approx 1.1547. 1.1547 *3m c²= approx 3.4641 m c².

Total E: 2.5 +3.4641 = 5.9641. So option C has E=5.96 mc².

So for the options, the relative speed is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so their relative speed is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (speed of the first astronaut) and \(v = 0.5c\) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
The first astronaut has mass \(2m\) and speed \(0.6c\). Calculating \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

The energy of the first astronaut is:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
The second astronaut has mass \(3m\) and speed \(0.5c\). Calculating \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]

The energy of the second astronaut is:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
