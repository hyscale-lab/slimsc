Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Wait, right, uncertainty in an observable is given by the standard deviation of the measurement, which is the square root of the expectation value of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, mathematically, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

So the steps I need to follow are:

1. Find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩.
2. Find the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩.
3. Compute ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩², then take the square root.

But wait, the system is in a specific state. Since the state is expressed in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, this might simplify calculations. Because if the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, then P_z is diagonal in this basis. That should make computing the expectation values easier.

Let me think: the given state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). These are the components in the P_z eigenbasis. So each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of P_z? Looking at the matrix provided for P_z:

P_z is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row is (0, 0, 0), third row is (0, 0, -ħ). So the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. Therefore, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ.

So the eigenstates are the basis vectors. So the state of the system is written as a linear combination of these eigenstates. The coefficients are the components of the state vector.

The state vector components are:
- |ψ₁|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4 → probability for P_z = ħ
- |ψ₂|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2 → probability for P_z = 0
- |ψ₃|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4 → probability for P_z = -ħ

Wait, but actually, the state vector is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). So each component is a coefficient multiplying the respective eigenstate. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ of P_z, with coefficients -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2.

So the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, is the sum of each probability multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So let's compute that. 

For the first component: coefficient is -1/2. The eigenvalue is ħ. So contribution is (-1/2)² * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|² * eigenvalue_i. Because the state is a linear combination, and the basis is orthonormal. So ⟨P_z⟩ = |c₁|² * λ₁ + |c₂|² * λ₂ + |c₃|² * λ₃.

So:

|c₁|² = (1/2)^2 → 1/4. λ₁ = ħ.

|c₂|² = (1/√2)^2 → 1/2. λ₂ = 0.

|c₃|² = (1/2)^2 → 1/4. λ₃ = -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = [ (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ = 0.

Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, P_z squared is the same as the square of the eigenvalues because in the eigenbasis, P_z is diagonal.

So each eigenvalue's square is (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2. So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |c₁|² (ħ²) + |c₂|² (0) + |c₃|² (ħ²).

Which is (1/4)(ħ²) + 0 + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔP_z squared is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2. Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to ⟨P_z²⟩.

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula for uncertainty in quantum mechanics:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state given by the column vector $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix. The coefficients of the state vector represent the amplitudes of the eigenstates, and their squared magnitudes give the probabilities.

- For the first eigenstate (eigenvalue $\hbar$): $|c_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.
- For the second eigenstate (eigenvalue $0$): $|c_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$.
- For the third eigenstate (eigenvalue $-\hbar$): $|c_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0^2$, and $(-\hbar)^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0^2 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$.
