Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical addition of velocities. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, but wait—the question is about their relative speed. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So how do I find how fast A sees B moving, or vice versa?

I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, actually, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure. So if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait—if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²))? Let me compute that.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 → 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) /0.7 → approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that would match one of the options.

Now, for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has a rest mass, but their kinetic energies and total energies are relativistic. The problem gives their masses as 2m and 3m. So I think I need to compute the total energy, which is the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. Or wait, no—relativistic total energy is gamma multiplied by rest energy.

Wait, the total energy of each astronaut is gamma * m c². So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So gamma is 5/4. So his total energy is 2m * 5/4 * c² = (2.5 m c²). Wait, no wait: wait, no, no. Wait, the rest energy is m c², so for A, it's (2m) * gamma. So A's energy is 2m * (5/4) c² = 2.5 m c². Similarly, for B, mass is 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So B's energy is 3m * 1.1547 c². Let me compute that: 3m * (2/√3) ) c². Since sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2, so 1/sqrt(3/4) is 2/√3 ≈1.1547.

So 3m * (2/√3) → (6/√3) m c². Simplify 6/√3: that's 2√3 m c² ≈3.464 m c².

So total energy is A's energy + B's energy: 2.5 +3.464 ≈5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². Option D says 5 mc², which would be if I just added their rest masses, but that's not relativistic. Option B has 4.96; that's not what I got. So the correct option should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity part. Another way to compute relative speed: if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me recalculate:

v1 = 0.6c, v2=0.5c.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c. So yes, that's correct. So the relative speed is around 0.14c.

So the only option that matches both is option C: v_rel 0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)) and astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

- Numerator: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
- Denominator: \(1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (\(2m\), \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (\(3m\), \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy is \(E \approx 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
