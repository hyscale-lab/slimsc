Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. It's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create a super low pressure environment, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have almost no gas molecules around because that helps in getting better electron microscopy images. But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spec detected them.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is like the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. So, the lower the pressure, the longer the mean free path because molecules don't hit each other as often.

But when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed something odd. The mean free path changed from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature stayed the same, which is important because temperature affects mean free path—higher temp usually means longer paths since molecules move faster and collide less.

Wait, so what's causing the change from λ1 to λ2? The presence of the electron beam. Oh right, when you have a high-energy electron beam, it can interact with the gas molecules in the chamber. How?

I remember that electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize. So when the electron beam hits the gas, it might knock electrons off the gas molecules, creating ions. These ions have a charge, so they might behave differently in the vacuum chamber.

In a regular vacuum, the main thing affecting the mean free path is the collisions between gas molecules. But now, with charged particles (ions), there's another factor: the electric fields in the microscope. The electron beam itself is a high-energy, focused beam. When the ions are created, the electric fields in the microscope's lenses and the beam might exert forces on these ions, causing them to move or accelerate.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules? Let me think. If the ions are being accelerated by the electric fields, they might move faster. Faster-moving ions would have a longer mean free path because they don't collide as often as slower ones. Alternatively, if the ions are being forced to move in a particular direction, maybe they collide with other molecules more or less?

Wait a second, another angle: when the gas is ionized, the ions might have different cross-sectional areas for collisions compared to neutral molecules. Or, perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces or get pumped out of the chamber. But in this case, the pressure is already ultra-low, so maybe pumping isn't the main factor.

Alternatively, think about how the presence of ions affects their movement. Neutral molecules' mean free path is determined by their elastic collisions. But for ions, they might experience other forces, like electrostatic deflection or acceleration, which could affect their path.

Wait, the question says that Mike observed a change in the mean free path when the electron beam was on. So before the beam, it was λ1, and after, it's λ2.

In a vacuum without the beam, the gas is neutral. When the beam is on, the gas becomes ionized. So, the molecules are now charged. Charged particles in an electric field will experience a force. The electron beam itself is a moving charge, so it creates an electric field? Or, more likely, the microscope's setup has static electric fields in the lenses to focus the beam.

So when the gas becomes ionized, the ions will be accelerated by these electric fields. This would change their velocity. If the ions are accelerated, they'll move faster. Faster-moving particles have a longer mean free path because they don't collide as often. So, the mean free path would increase.

Alternatively, if the ions are moving in a direction, perhaps they're less likely to collide with each other or with the chamber walls, depending on their movement.

Wait, but the mean free path is calculated based on the density of the gas and the cross-sectional area for collisions. But if ions are accelerated, their velocity might change, which affects the collision rate.

The formula for the mean free path is λ = 1/(n * σ * v), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section, and v is the average velocity.

In an ultra-high vacuum, n is very small, so λ is large. For the same n and σ, if v increases (because the ions are accelerated), λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but another thought: if the ions are moving faster, the time between collisions would be longer. Hence, the mean free path should be longer.

But wait, in the initial state (λ1), the gas is neutral. After ionization (λ2), the gas becomes charged. Does the ionization affect the number of particles, or the effective cross-section? Or perhaps the ions stick to the walls more, reducing the effective pressure?

Alternatively, maybe the ions don't collide as much because they're moving faster, so λ increases.

But wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that it causes the gas to heat up. But the question says the temperature remained the same, so that's not a factor.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas has a different behavior. For instance, if the gas becomes a plasma, but that's at much higher densities. Here, the pressure is already ultra-low, so it's more like a few gas atoms per cubic centimeter. So, the ions wouldn't form a plasma.

Wait, but when a gas is ionized, the number of particles doesn't change, but their charge does. So n remains the same, but their velocity might change due to the electric fields in the microscope.

But how does that affect the mean free path? Let's think. The mean free path equation is λ = 1/(n σ v). If v increases, λ increases. So λ2 should be greater than λ1.

Wait but considering that the ions are charged, perhaps the effective cross-section σ changes. For neutral molecules, σ is based on their size, but for ions, perhaps it's different. Ions might have a larger cross-section because they can interact through electrostatic forces, not just collisions.

If σ increases, then λ would decrease. But if v increases, λ increases.

So which effect is more significant? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ions are accelerated by the electric fields, causing them to move faster, which would significantly increase the mean free path.

In the initial scenario, the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the ions are accelerated, so v increases. So λ2 increases. So λ2 > λ1.

But wait, another possibility: the presence of ions could cause them to be repelled by the beam or attracted, which could remove them from the compartment. If the ions are being pumped away or leave the compartment quickly, the effective pressure might decrease, which would increase the mean free path. But in that case, n (number density) would decrease. So λ = 1/(n σ v). If n decreases, λ increases.

But in the initial scenario, Mike already measured λ1, and when the beam is on, the gas is ionized but the temperature is the same. So if n is the same, but the velocity is higher due to acceleration, then λ increases.

But wait, let me think again. How does the ionization affect the velocity?

In the electron microscope, the electron beam has a high energy. When it hits a gas molecule, it can cause ionization by either removing an electron (creating a positive ion) or adding one (creating a negative ion, but that's less likely with a positive beam). The ionization process itself requires energy. So, when a molecule is ionized, it gains some kinetic energy.

Wait, from the ionization perspective: the ionization process can impart kinetic energy to the ion. So, the ion's velocity increases because it gains energy. So, the velocity v would be higher than before.

So, in λ = 1/(n σ v), if v increases, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Alternatively, the ions might experience a force due to the electric fields in the microscope's lenses. The electron beam is focused using electric or magnetic fields. These fields could accelerate or decelerate the ions, changing their velocity.

Wait, but the majority of the ions would have their velocity changed. So, for example, if the ions are accelerated, their velocity increases, leading to a longer mean free path.

So, in this case, λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So, if λ2 is greater than λ1, then it's either A or D.

Wait, the question says that the mean free path changed when the electron beam was on. So from λ1 to λ2.

But wait another thought—could the presence of the beam cause the gas to conduct electricity, leading to a current, which might cause changes in pressure or other factors?

Wait, perhaps the ions are being attracted to the electron beam, which is positively charged (since electrons are negative). So the ions (which are positively charged) would be attracted to the beam. This could cause them to move towards the beam, making them more likely to hit the beam or the walls, thus reducing the mean free path. Or maybe the ions are being focused into a region where they are more likely to collide.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are being repelled from certain areas, leading to different collision dynamics.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the physics.

The mean free path is primarily determined by the gas density and the speed of the molecules. When the gas is ionized, the ions have a different effective mass? No, wait, same mass as neutral molecules, just charged.

Wait, the ions are accelerated by the electric fields. If the beam is on, the ions experience a force. Let's say the electric field in the microscope's lenses accelerates the ions. The force F = qE, where q is charge and E is electric field. So F = eE (since gas is likely positively ionized, so q=e).

The acceleration a = F/m = eE/(m), where m is the mass of the ion.

This acceleration would change the velocity of the ion. Assuming the ions are accelerated in the direction of the beam, their velocity increases, leading to a longer mean free path.

So, with higher velocity, the mean free path increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the velocity in the mean free path equation is the average velocity. If the ions are moving faster, then the time between collisions would be longer. Hence, the mean free path increases.

So, λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, which ones have λ2 > λ1?

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Option D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

Wait, but why would λ2 be more than 1.22 times or between λ1 and 1.22 λ1?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ions' velocity isn't so significantly higher. Let's think about the ion's velocity.

In the initial state, let's say the gas is at a certain temperature, so the average speed is v1. After ionization and acceleration, the speed becomes v2.

Suppose the electric field imparts a certain amount of energy to the ion.

But the energy gained by the ion would be E = (1/2) m v². But without knowing the specifics of the electric field strength, it's hard to tell. However, the problem states that the temperature is the same, so thermal velocities are the same.

Wait, but when you ionize the gas, the kinetic energy from ionization could also change the velocity. Or perhaps the electron beam's energy is much higher than the thermal energy, so the ion's speed increases.

But all these are a bit unclear. So, perhaps the main point is that λ2 increases.

So the options are A, D, or possibly C. Wait, no, C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the opposite of what we expect.

So if λ2 is larger than λ1, the options could be A or D.

But what determines whether it's more than 1.22 times or between λ1 and 1.22 times.

Wait, 1.22 is roughly sqrt( (π/2) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the factor when considering the most probable speed vs average speed. Or maybe it's a factor from the kinetic theory.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electric field causes the mean free path to be longer by a factor related to the velocity increase.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 > λ1, which would make options A or D possible.

Wait, the question states that Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1, but it's λ2. So, it's definitely changed. So, λ2 is different.

So, what could cause λ2 to be less than λ1? If the ions are moving slower, which would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, but why would the ions move slower? If the electric field is opposite to their motion, they could be decelerated. But why would that happen?

Wait, the electron beam is negatively charged. The gas is in the sample chamber. The electron beam is moving towards the sample. The ions, being positively charged, would be attracted to the beam. So, the ions would be accelerated towards the beam. If the ions are moving towards the beam, that might cause them to hit the beam or the walls more often, thus reducing their mean free path.

Wait, but the beam is a very focused, high-energy stream. The ions might not be significantly affected by it unless they're in the direct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam creates an electric field that causes the ions to be pulled into regions where the electron beam is, leading to more frequent collisions with the beam or the walls. This would mean that the mean free path decreases because the ions are colliding more frequently.

Wait, that's a different angle. So, if the ions are being directed towards the beam or the walls, their path length before a collision would be shorter. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but then earlier reasoning suggested that higher velocity would lead to longer λ.

Hmm. So which effect dominates? The velocity increase or the change in direction leading to more collisions?

I think the key is to consider if the ions' movement is more or less likely to cause collisions.

If the ions are accelerated towards the beam, they might hit the beam more, but since the beam is a very focused point, perhaps the probability of collision is low. Alternatively, the ions might be repelled, causing them to move away from the beam, but in an ultra-high vacuum, collisions between ions and the chamber walls are more likely.

Wait, but if the ions are moving faster, their mean free path increases. So in that case, λ2 > λ1.

Alternatively, if the ions are moving towards the beam and the beam is a small target, maybe their mean free path is unaffected because they mostly move in the same way as before but faster.

I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think of it in terms of forces. The ion's motion is influenced by the electric field. The direction of this field would determine whether the ion is accelerated or decelerated.

In a typical electron microscope, the electron beam is focused using electric fields that create a potential. So, the ions in the chamber might be accelerated or decelerated by these fields. Suppose the electric field causes the ions to accelerate. Then their velocity increases, leading to a longer mean free path.

But wait, the electron beam is moving towards the sample. The ions are in the chamber. The electric field from the beam's optics might be such that the ions are repelled or attracted. Positively charged ions would be attracted to the negatively charged electron beam (since electrons are negative). So the ions would be pulled towards the beam, which is moving. But in the chamber, the beam is a narrow column. So the ions might be accelerated towards the beam, causing them to move faster in that direction.

If the ions are moving towards the beam, their velocity in that direction is higher, so the time between collisions would be longer. Thus, the mean free path would increase.

But wait, if the ions are moving in a particular direction, perhaps they are more likely to hit the walls of the chamber in that direction sooner. So, the mean free path might not increase as much as expected because they're moving towards a wall.

Hmm. Alternatively, the mean free path is a statistical measure; it's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the ions are moving faster, they'll cover that distance quicker, but the number of collisions would be the same as before.

Wait, perhaps not. Because in addition to speed, the ions might have a different distribution of velocities. For example, in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, higher speeds mean a longer average path.

In the initial state (λ1), the gas is neutral, so the mean free path is based on their thermal velocity. When the beam is on, the ions are accelerated, so their velocity increases, leading to a longer mean free path—so λ2 > λ1.

So, Mike saw that λ2 is different from λ1, and the only way that makes sense is that λ2 is larger.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1, which suggests a significant increase. Option D says it's between λ1 and 1.22 times.

But why would it be exactly 1.22 times?

Well, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the acceleration gives the ions a velocity such that their mean free path increases by a factor of sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414. But 1.22 is a different number. Alternatively, maybe the factor arises from the change in the collision rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam also causes the gas to ionize, leading to a lower number density because ions are being pumped out or stick to the walls more.

Wait, ions have a higher charge, so perhaps they are more easily pumped out by the vacuum pumps. Or, perhaps they're more likely to stick to the chamber walls because they can adhere more easily than neutral molecules.

If n decreases, then λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1 because n is lower.

So, in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So, options A or D.

But why would the mean free path change by a certain factor?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the scattering of electrons by gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, which could cause them to scatter more. But Mike is measuring the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, the question says that upon initiating the electron beam, Mike made an observation concerning the mean free path of the gas molecules. Wait, no—I think it's about the electron scattering, leading to the gas's mean free path changing.

Wait, no: The question says Mike accurately determined the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1. Then, when the electron beam was on, he found the mean free path was λ2.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, and the ions have a shorter mean free path because they are charged and interact more with the chamber walls or other ions.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam increases the electron scattering, which affects the way gas molecules move, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The mean free path λ is given by the formula:

λ = 1/(n * π * d^2 * √(8kT/(π m))} )

where d is the diameter of the gas molecule, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and m is mass.

If the temperature is the same, and n doesn't change (since the pressure is the same), then λ doesn't change. But in reality, when the beam is on, the gas is ionized. So perhaps the number density n remains the same, but the effective cross-section changes.

Wait, but the problem states that the temperature remained the same. So T is same. So, if n is same, λ remains same. But in reality, the beam could cause n to change.

Wait, but Mike's setup already has an ultra-high vacuum. Even with the beam on, the number of gas particles is extremely low. So, perhaps the ionization doesn't change n much.

But if the ions' velocity increases, due to the electric field, then the mean free path would increase.

So, without knowing the exact reason but based on the reasoning that velocity increases, λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, which ones have λ2 > λ1? Options A and D.

The question is, which option is correct. So, how much larger is λ2 compared to λ1?

But the problem states that the mean free path changed. So λ2 is not equal to λ1, which is why options B is incorrect.

So, λ2 is either greater or smaller than λ1. But according to earlier reasoning, λ2 is greater.

So the options are A or D.

But why would the factor be 1.22 times or between λ1 and 1.22 λ1?

Hmm, perhaps it's about the square root of 2. If the velocity increases by sqrt(2), then λ would increase by sqrt(2) since λ is inversely proportional to velocity. Wait, no: because in the formula, λ is inversely proportional to velocity. So if velocity doubles, λ is halved. Wait, no: if velocity increases, λ should increase.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let's write the formula again.

λ = 1/(n σ v)

If n is same, and σ remains same, but v increases by a factor of k, then λ increases by k.

So, if v increases by 1.22 times, λ increases by 1.22 times.

But what's the reason for v increasing by 1.22 times? Maybe because the ions are accelerated by the electric field, and their kinetic energy increases by a certain factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to heat up, but the temperature is same, so that's not a factor.

Wait, but the velocity distribution is determined by the temperature. If the temperature is same, the average velocity remains the same. So, if the temperature is same, but the gas is ionized and accelerated, perhaps the velocity increases.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested λ2 > λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons in the beam are causing the gas molecules to ionize, and the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, thereby reducing the number of gas particles in the chamber. If n decreases, then λ increases. So lambda2 would be bigger.

Hence, options A or D.

But the question states that the mean free path changed upon initiating the electron beam. So, it's either λ2 > λ1 or λ2 < λ1.

But why would λ2 be less than λ1?

Perhaps the ionized gas molecules are more likely to collide with each other or the walls because of their charge, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So, if the ions are charged, they may experience more frequent collisions due to electrostatic interactions. So, the cross-section σ increases, which would cause λ to decrease.

So, if σ increases, λ decreases.

But I thought earlier that if the velocity increases, λ increases. So which effect is more significant?

If σ increases more than velocity does, λ would decrease.

But without knowing the exact factors, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to heat up, but the problem states the temperature is same.

Wait, perhaps the ions are being pulled into the beam, which is a small area, leading to more frequent collisions with the beam or the walls, hence reducing λ.

But I'm not confident.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning about velocity. I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces additional scattering mechanisms for the gas molecules, causing them to collide more frequently, thus decreasing the mean free path.

But wait, the mean free path is of the gas molecules, not the electrons. But maybe the beam's presence causes the gas to ionize, and the ions are more likely to stick to the walls or get scattered, leading to a shorter mean free path.

In that case, λ2 would be less than λ1.

So, which option is that? Option C: λ2 < λ1.

But earlier reasoning suggested that velocity increases would lead to longer mean free path. So which is correct?

I think I need to make a decision here. Based on the fact that the electron beam causes ionization, the ions may have different behavior. One possibility is that the ions are more likely to be accelerated towards the walls, leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam doesn't change the number of collisions much but increases the speed, leading to a longer mean free path.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of it from another angle. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the product of number density, cross-section, and velocity.

If the beam causes ionization, the cross-section might increase because charged particles interact more. So, σ increases. If σ increases more than velocity, then λ decreases.

Alternatively, if the velocity increases more than σ, λ increases.

But without knowing, it's hard to say. But perhaps the dominant effect is that the ions stick more to the walls, leading to a lower number density. So n decreases, so λ increases.

Wait, but n is the number density. If the ions are being pumped out more efficiently, n would decrease. So, the mean free path increases.

But I'm not sure about that. Another possibility is that the mean free path doesn't change much because the pressure is already so low. So the initial and changed mean free paths are similar.

But the question states that Mike observed a change, so λ2 is different.

Hmm. I'm going to have to make a choice based on reasoning, even if uncertain.

If the ionization makes the gas molecules charged, they might have a larger cross-section, leading to more frequent collisions, hence λ2 < λ1.

So the answer would be C) λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, if the ions are accelerated, their velocity increases, leading to longer λ, so A or D.

But why would the cross-section increase? I think that for charged particles, the cross-section for collisions could be larger because they can be deflected by electric fields, leading to more frequent collisions.

So, the increased cross-section would cause the mean free path to decrease.

So, in that case, the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question revolves around the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum chamber of a transmission electron microscope when the electron beam is activated. Initially, Mike measures the mean free path as λ₁ under vacuum conditions. Upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ₂, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup (λ₁):**  
   In the ultra-high vacuum state (<10⁻⁹ Torr), the gas molecules are neutral, and the mean free path λ₁ is determined by the low pressure, temperature, and molecular interactions. The formula for the mean free path is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \cdot \sigma \cdot v}
   \]  
   where \( n \) is the number density, \( \sigma \) is the collision cross-section, and \( v \) is the average molecular velocity.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam (λ₂):**  
   When the electron beam is activated, gas molecules become ionized. This introduces several changes:  
   - **Ionization:** Charged particles (ions) interact differently with the environment. For example, they may experience electrostatic forces due to the electric fields in the microscope's lenses, which could alter their velocity or trajectory.  
   - **Cross-Section (\( \sigma \)):** Ions may have a larger effective cross-section due to electrostatic interactions, leading to more frequent collisions.  
   - **Velocity (\( v \)):** Ions could be accelerated by the electric fields, increasing their velocity and potentially extending the mean free path.  

3. **Reasoning for λ₂ vs. λ₁:**  
   - If the ions are accelerated, their velocity increases, which would lengthen the mean free path (\( \lambda \)).  
   - However, the charged nature of ions could also increase the collision cross-section (\( \sigma \)), leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter mean free path (\( \lambda \)).  
   - Additionally, ionized particles might be more likely to stick to the chamber walls or be removed by the vacuum pumps, effectively reducing the number density (\( n \)) and increasing \( \lambda \).  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The dominant effect appears to be the increased collision cross-section due to ionization, which causes the mean free path to decrease. Thus, \( \lambda₂ < \lambda₁ \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) \( \lambda₂ \geq 1.22 \cdot \lambda₁ \):** This implies a significant increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the reasoning that ionization leads to more frequent collisions.  
- **B) \( \lambda₂ = \lambda₁ \):** This suggests no change, but the problem explicitly states that Mike observed a change in the mean free path.  
- **C) \( \lambda₂ < \lambda₁ \):** This aligns with the reasoning that ionization increases the collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path.  
- **D) \( \lambda₁ < \lambda₂ < 1.22 \cdot \lambda₁ \):** This implies a moderate increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the expected decrease due to ionization.

### Final Answer:
The most consistent conclusion is that the mean free path decreases when the electron beam is activated, making **C) \( \lambda₂ < \lambda₁ \)** the correct choice.

Answer: C
