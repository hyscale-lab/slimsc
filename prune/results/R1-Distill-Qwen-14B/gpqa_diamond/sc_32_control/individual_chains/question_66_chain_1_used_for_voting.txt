Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model plus higher-dimensional operators to describe interactions beyond the SM. But wait, what's the deal with symmetries here?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because all the operators are built from SM fields in a way that maintains this symmetry. Effective theories usually preserve the same symmetries as the original theory. The SM has Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT does too. So operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Oh wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, effective field theories are valid at low energies, and they have a cutoff scale. So do they respect Poincare? Or is it that they don't necessarily preserve the full Poincare because of the cutoff? Or maybe the operators are written in a way that they still respect Poincare. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's valid below some cutoff, but the operators are constructed in a way that respects the same symmetries as the SM. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT should too. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Because in effective theories, you can have operators that don't have the same symmetries as the original theory, but I think in SMEFT specifically, it's constructed to respect the same gauge and Lorentz symmetries as the SM. So both Lorentz and Poincare are respected.

Moving on, CP symmetry. SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. Because some of the higher-dimensional operators can violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator violates CP. So the operators may or may not respect CP, but it's not a must. So option 3 isn't something that must be respected by all operators.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in relativity, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz, it must respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: yes

2. Poincare: yes. Because if the theory is Lorentz and translation invariant, it's Poincare.

Wait, but do effective theories like SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare? Because I'm thinking that in an effective theory, you have a cutoff and maybe some non-Poincare aspects? Or does SMEFT still have the full Poincare? I think that SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so yes, Poincare is respected.

So options 1 and 2 must be respected. No, wait, no. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. But in an effective theory, which is valid up to a cutoff, the full Poincare symmetry might not hold. Wait, but the way SMEFT is built is by including all possible operators consistent with the SM symmetries, which include Poincare. So I think the operators are required to be Poincare invariant.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Poincare symmetry includes translations. But when you write an effective theory, you're expanding around a certain scale, and the renormalization process might break some of the symmetries, but in the case of SMEFT, it's constructed as a Lorentz and gauge invariant theory, so Poincare is included.

So, the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are musts.

Then, CPT symmetry is a must because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, so CPT must hold.

So all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So which options are these?

Looking at the choices:

Option C is 1,2,4. So Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Option A is 1 and 2. So which is correct?

Wait, the original question says which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

But wait, I might have made a mistake. Let's check.

In SMEFT, all operators are constructed to be invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare? Or is that automatically implied?

Because Poincare includes translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, the operators are local, so their form should respect translation invariance as well. So yes, they should respect Poincare.

So, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The SM itself is Poincare-invariant, so SMEFT, as an effective theory of the SM, must also be Poincare-invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is '1,2,4'. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but what about option C versus option D. Option D is 1,3,4. But we decided that 3 (CP) is not necessarily respected. So option C is correct.

But wait, wait. Another angle: SMEFT operators must respect gauge symmetry, Lorentz, and possibly others. But what about Poincare? Because in some cases, the effective theory may not be translationally invariant, but I think SMEFT is constructed such that all operators have the same transformation properties as in the SM. So yes, they must be Poincare-invariant.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. The effective theory, being a low-energy approximation, must still respect these because the underlying theory (SM) does. So yes.

So the answer should be options 1,2,4, which is option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM). Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. SMEFT is formulated as a low-energy effective theory, but it is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the SM. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT operators must also respect it.

3. **CP Symmetry**: SMEFT does not necessarily respect CP symmetry. For example, some higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT, such as the Weinberg operator, explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: All Lorentz-invariant theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). This corresponds to option **C**.
