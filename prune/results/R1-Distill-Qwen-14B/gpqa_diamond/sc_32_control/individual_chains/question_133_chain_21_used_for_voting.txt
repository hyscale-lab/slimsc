Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 200 mL since 1 cm³ equals 1 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Oh wait, what's orthophosphate? I remember that in phosphate solutions, H3PO4 can dissociate into different forms: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate, I think, refers to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-. So the question is asking for [PO4^3-].

The Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-. The second is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-, and the third is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Hmm, the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think this is a buffer solution problem because we're mixing a weak acid with its conjugate base or vice versa. Let me think about the species involved.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (from the first dissociation) and the conjugate acid of HPO4^2- (from the second dissociation).

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4·2H2O). When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- and the conjugate acid of PO4^3-.

Wait, so in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That sounds like a buffer system. But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the completely deprotonated form. How does that come into play?

Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but we're to find the concentration of PO4^3-. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the solution acts as a buffer for the second dissociation. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-. So if we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, their concentrations would be determined by the buffer equation using Ka2.

But the question is about PO4^3-, which is the product of the third dissociation. So HPO4^2- can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3- with Ka3. So the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH of the solution.

Wait, but how do we find the pH of the solution? Because to find [PO4^3-], I think I need to know the concentration of H+ ions, which relates to the pH.

Alternatively, maybe the solution's pH is determined by the buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and then using that pH, we can calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.

So the steps I think are:

1. Calculate the molarity of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in the solution.
2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from these.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2 to find the pH of the solution.
4. Use the Ka3 expression to find [PO4^3-] based on [HPO4^2-] and [H+].

Let me get into each step.

Step 1: Calculate moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let me compute that.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ approximately 0.00733 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 1/177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but the solution volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. So the molarity (concentration) would be moles / 0.2 L.

So for KH2PO4: 0.00733 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.03665 M. Since KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4^-, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03665 M.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 0.00561 mol in 0.2 L → 0.02805 M. Since it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. No. Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissolves, each formula unit gives one HPO4^2- ion, right? So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, using the buffer equation for H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- system. The buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that.

log(6.2) is about 0.79, and log(1e-8) is -8, so pKa2 ≈ 7.21.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. The log of 6.2 is approximately 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.792 - 8 = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208.

But wait, wait. pKa is -log(Ka). So if Ka is 6.2e-8, then pKa is about 7.21. Yes, correct.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03665 M.

So the ratio is 0.02805 / 0.03665 ≈ let's compute that.

0.02805 / 0.03665 ≈ 0.766.

So log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

So pH = 7.21 + (-0.114) ≈ 7.096.

So the pH is approximately 7.10.

Wait, but the solution may have a pH around 7.1, which is slightly basic. That makes sense because HPO4^2- is a weak base and H2PO4^- is a weak acid.

Now, with the pH known, we can find [PO4^3-], which comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Wait, wait, no. Ka3 is for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-. So the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, but [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.10, so [H+] = 10^-pH = 10^(-7.10) ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

Wait, let's compute 10^-7.10. 10^-7 is 1e-7, which is 1e-7. 10^-0.10 is about 0.794. So 7.94e-8 M.

So now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

So plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (7.94e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Divide by 7.94e-8: 5.049e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ (5.049 / 7.94) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.635 * 1e-6 → 6.35e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = let's compute:

1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049. So 0.05049e-12 = 5.049e-14.

Then, 5.049e-14 divided by 7.94e-8.

5.049e-14 / 7.94e-8 = (5.049 / 7.94) * 1e-6.

5.049 /7.94 is approximately 0.6355. So 0.6355e-6 = 6.355e-7 M.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option B is 5.48e-7, C is 2.81e-7, D is 3.97e-7.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 6.35e-7, which is near option A (6.24e-7), but maybe I should be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the pH. Let me recheck that step.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03665 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.03665.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.02805 / 0.03665 = (28.05 /36.65) × 1e-2 /1e-2 → same as 28.05 /36.65.

28.05 ÷36.65.

Well, 28 ÷36 is 0.777..., but let's compute 28.05 ÷36.65 = ?

Let me do it step by step.

36.65 × 0.766 = ?

0.766 *36.65 → 36.65 *0.7=25.655; 36.65*0.06=2.199; 36.65*0.006=0.2199.

Total 25.655 +2.199 =27.854 +0.2199=28.0739.

So 0.766 *36.65 = ~28.07, which is close to 28.05. So that's approximately 0.766.

So the ratio is 0.766. Log(0.766) = ?

Log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.21 - 0.114 =7.096, which I approximated as 7.10.

But to get more precise, maybe I can compute it as 7.096.

So [H+] = 10^-7.096.

Wait, 10^-7.096 = 10^( -7 - 0.096 )= 10^-7 * 10^-0.096.

10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-0.096 is approximately 0.871, because log(0.871)= -0.0685, but wait, wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, 10^-0.096 is the same as 1/(10^0.096). What's 10^0.096?

We know that 10^0.1 is approximately 1.2589, and 0.096 is 0.96 ×0.1, so maybe around 1.2589^0.96?

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 0.096 is approximately 0.095.

ln(10^0.095) = 0.095 * ln(10) ≈ 0.095 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.2187.

So e^0.2187 ≈ 1.244.

So 10^0.095 ≈ 1.244. So 10^-0.095 ≈1/1.244 ≈0.804.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact value.

Wait, another approach: 10^x where x=0.096.

We can compute using the Taylor series or logarithm tables, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 10^-0.096 is approximately 0.871.

Wait, but when pH is 7.096, [H+]=10^-7.096 ≈ 8.3e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^-7.096.

We can write it as 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.096).

10^-7 is 1e-7.

10^-0.096: Let's compute 0.096 in terms of log.

We know that log(8) is 0.9031, so 10^0.9031=8.

Wait, 10^0.095 ≈ ?

Using the formula for small x: 10^x ≈ 1 + x * ln(10).

Wait, but x is 0.095, which is not that small. Maybe a better approximation: using log(8.1)=0.9085, so 10^0.9085=8.1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find 10^-0.096. Let me think of it as 1/(10^0.096).

I think 10^0.096 is approximately 1.245, because log(1.245) ≈ log(1.25) is about 0.09691.

Wait, wait, log(1.25) is 0.09691. So 10^0.09691=1.25.

So 0.096 is just shy of that. So 10^0.096 ≈1.245, so 10^-0.096 ≈1/1.245 ≈0.803.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.803 ≈8.03e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought 10^-0.096 is around 0.871. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, when pH is 7.096, [H+] = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.096) → which is 1e-7 * approx 0.803 → 8.03e-8 M.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me get this right.

[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.096) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.096).

10^(-0.096) is 1 / 10^(0.096). Let me compute 10^0.096.

So 0.096 is between 0.09 and 0.10.

We know that:

10^0.09 ≈ 1.23 (since 10^0.1 is approximately 1.2589, so maybe 1.23 for 0.09).

But perhaps using a calculator approach, 0.096 * ln(10) ≈0.096 * 2.302585 ≈0.221.

So e^0.221 ≈ 1.247.

So 10^0.096 ≈ e^{(0.096 * ln 10)} ≈ e^0.221 ≈1.247.

So 10^(-0.096) is 1/1.247≈0.802.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.802 =8.02e-8 M.

So now going back to [PO4^3-] calculation.

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

[H+] is approximately 8.02e-8 M.

So let's compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = ?

1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049 → 5.049e-14.

Denominator:8.02e-8.

So 5.049e-14 / 8.02e-8 = (5.049 /8.02) * 1e-6.

5.049 ÷8.02 ≈ let's compute.

8.02 × 0.629= 8.02*0.6=4.812, 8.02*0.02=0.1604, 8.02*0.009=0.07218. So 4.812+0.1604=4.9724 +0.07218=5.0446. So 0.629 gives 5.0446, which is very close to 5.049. So approximately 0.629.

So 0.629 * 1e-6 = 6.29e-7 M.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to our calculated 6.29e-7. So perhaps option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other factors I'm missing?

Wait, when we added the two salts, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, their dissociations contribute to phosphate species. But the solution is a buffer for the second dissociation, so the pH is determined by that. Then, we use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation.

Another thing to consider: when you have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, they can exist in equilibrium. But since the concentration of PO4^3- is very low, perhaps we can approximate it using the third dissociation.

Wait, but perhaps we can approach this using the exact expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

Rearranged to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

Which is what I used.

But wait, in the solution, is the concentration of HPO4^2- the same as the initial concentration from the salt? Or does it change due to the buffer?

Wait, no. Because in the buffer solution, the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^- and the undissociated HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4. But in this case, the concentrations are given from the salts, so the HPO4^2- is initially 0.02805 M, and H2PO4^- is 0.03665 M. So the ratio is fixed, leading to a specific pH.

Thus, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is correct here.

I think the calculations are correct, leading to approximately 6.29e-7 M, which is closest to option A:6.24e-7 M.

But wait, let me double-check all the steps for any errors.

Wait, the molecular weights: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. 1g is 1/136.09 ≈0.00733 moles. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. 1g is 1/177.99 ≈0.00561 moles. Correct.

Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L.

So concentrations are 0.00733 /0.2 ≈0.03665 M H2PO4^-.

0.00561 /0.2 ≈0.02805 M HPO4^2-.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which is 7.208 + log(0.02805/0.03665) → log(0.766)= -0.114 → pH=7.094.

So [H+] = 10^-7.094 ≈8.02e-8 M.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02805 ) / (8.02e-8 )

Which calculates to (5.049e-14)/(8.02e-8) → approximately 6.29e-7 M.

Hmm, that's very close to option A (6.24e-7), but perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.096.

[H+] = 10^-7.096.

Let me compute 10^-7.096 precisely.

7.096 =7 + 0.096.

So 10^-7.096 = 1e-7 * 10^-0.096.

What's 10^-0.096?

We can use a calculator for more precision, but since I don't have a calculator, I'll try to compute it more accurately.

We know that log(1.23) is approximately 0.0899.

Log(1.24) is approximately 0.0936.

Wait, wait, no. Actually, the logarithm of 1.23 is about 0.0899.

Wait, let me think: 10^0.09=1.23.

Wait, 1.23^10 is approximately?

Well, 10^0.09≈1.23, because 1.23^10 would be (10^{0.09})^10 = 10^0.9, which is about 7.94.

But that's perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, since 10^0.09 ≈1.23, then 10^0.096 is a bit higher.

Let me see, 0.096 is 0.09 +0.006.

So 10^0.09 =1.23.

And 10^0.006: let's approximate.

ln(10^0.006) =0.006 * ln(10)=0.006 * 2.3026≈0.0138.

So 10^0.006 ≈e^0.0138 ≈1.0139.

So 10^0.096=10^0.09 * 10^0.006 ≈1.23 *1.0139≈1.246.

So 10^0.096≈1.246, so 10^-0.096≈1/1.246≈0.8027.

So [H+]=1e-7 * 0.8027=8.027e-8 M.

So back to the [PO4^3-] calculation.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02805)/(8.027e-8 )

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02805 =5.049e-14.

Denominator:8.027e-8.

So 5.049e-14/8.027e-8 = (5.049/8.027) * 1e-6.

5.049 ÷8.027 ≈ let me compute that.

8.027 × 0.6285 = ?

8.027 *0.6 =4.8162.

8.027 *0.02=0.16054.

8.027 *0.0085= 0.0682295.

Adding them: 4.8162 +0.16054=4.97674 +0.0682295=5.04497.

Which is very close to 5.049. So 0.6285 gives 5.04497, very close to 5.049.

So 5.049/8.027 ≈0.6288.

So 0.6288 *1e-6 =6.288e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.29e-7 M.

So the options are:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7 M

C)2.81e-7 M

D)3.97e-7 M

So 6.29e-7 is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M), but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.8e-12 *0.02805 more accurately.

1.8 *0.02805 =1.8 *28.05 *1e-3 → 50.49 *1e-3 →0.05049 →5.049e-2.

Wait, no, wait, 1.8e-12 *0.02805 = (1.8 *0.02805) *1e-12 = 0.05049 *1e-12 =5.049e-14.

So that's correct.

Then, 5.049e-14 /8.027e-8.

Let me compute 5.049e-14 /8.027e-8.

That's (5.049 /8.027) * 1e-6.

5.049 ÷8.027 → let's compute this as a division.

8.027 ×0.629 = ?

8 ×0.629=5.032

0.027 ×0.629≈0.01698.

Total≈5.032 +0.01698=5.04898.

Which is very close to 5.049. So 0.629 gives exactly 5.049.

So 5.049 ÷8.027 =0.629.

Thus, [PO4^3-] =0.629e-6 →6.29e-7 M.

So the correct option is A)6.24e-7 M. But my calculation gives 6.29e-7, which is slightly higher than option A.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, let me recheck the ratio.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-]=0.03665 M.

So ratio is 0.02805 /0.03665.

Compute 0.02805 ÷0.03665.

Let me compute this as 28.05 ÷36.65.

28.05 ÷36.65 = approximately 0.766.

Wait, 36.65 ×0.766 =28.0451, which is very close to 28.05.

So the ratio is exactly 0.766.

log(0.766) = ?

Using a calculator (if I had one), I think it's approximately -0.114.

So pH =7.208 -0.114=7.094.

So [H+]=10^-7.094.

Which as calculated earlier is approximately 8.027e-8.

So the [PO4^3-] is 6.29e-7 M.

But none of the options exactly match this, but option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether I missed any contribution from the autoionization of water or other sources. But I think that's negligible here.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem expects us to account for the fact that the solution is a buffer, but maybe the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is not just from the Na2HPO4 but also from the dissociation of KH2PO4.

Wait, wait. Wait, in solution, KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4^-. Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] =0.03665 M, [HPO4^2-]=0.02805 M.

In the solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- will dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-.

But the buffer system is mainly for the second dissociation, so the concentrations are determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and the PO4^3- comes from the third.

Wait, perhaps the exact concentration of HPO4^2- is a bit more than 0.02805 M because some H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2-.

But in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is given by 10^(pH - pKa2).

Wait, but that's exactly what I did earlier. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the [PO4^3-] is 6.29e-7, which is closest to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise calculations.

Wait, let me compute 5.049e-14 divided by 8.027e-8.

5.049e-14 /8.027e-8 = (5.049 /8.027) * 1e-6.

5.049 ÷8.027.

Compute 8.027 × 0.629=5.04898, which is almost 5.049. So that gives 0.629.

So 0.629e-6 =6.29e-7.

But option A is 6.24e-7. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is considering only the contribution from the third dissociation, but maybe the HPO4^2- comes from both the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of KH2PO4.

Wait, but in the solution, the majority of HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4, which is 0.02805 M, and some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-, but that's a small amount because the pH is around 7.1.

Wait, the H2PO4^- has a concentration of 0.03665 M, and the solution's pH is about 7.1, which is above the pKa2 (7.21).

Wait, when pH > pKa2, the HPO4^2- is the dominant species.

But in the solution, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.766, which is less than 1, implying that H2PO4^- is more abundant, which is opposite to what I thought earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, if pH is 7.096, which is just below pKa2 (7.21), so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.766, which is less than 1. So more H2PO4^- is present than HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the initial concentrations were [H2PO4^-] =0.03665 M, [HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M. So their ratio is 0.766, which is why the pH is just below pKa2.

Wait, that makes sense.

But I'm still confident that the method is correct. So the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.29e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But wait, the option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is slightly less than my calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, let me recalculate the ratio in the log.

If the ratio is 0.02805/0.03665 =0.766 exactly.

What's the log(0.766)?

Using a calculator, log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

But perhaps a more precise value?

Let me compute it using a Taylor expansion or a better approximation.

We can write log(0.766) as log(1 - 0.234) ≈ -0.234/(ln(10)) - (0.234)^2/(2*(ln(10))^2) - ... 

But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, using the natural logarithm:

ln(0.766) ≈ -0.266.

Then, log(0.766) = ln(0.766)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.266)/(2.3026) ≈-0.1155.

So pH =7.208 -0.1155=7.0925.

So [H+] =10^-7.0925.

Which is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0925).

10^(-0.0925)=1/(10^0.0925).

10^0.0925: since log(1.235)=0.0908, and log(1.24)=0.0933.

So 0.0925 is between 0.0908 and 0.0933, so 10^0.0925 is approximately 1.238.

So 10^-0.0925 ≈1/1.238≈0.807.

So [H+]=1e-7 *0.807=8.07e-8 M.

Thus, going back to [PO4^3-].

(1.8e-12 *0.02805)/(8.07e-8) =5.049e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.049/8.07)*1e-6.

5.049/8.07 ≈ 0.626.

So 0.626e-6=6.26e-7 M.

Which is 6.26e-7, which is even closer to option A (6.24e-7).

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The key steps are as follows:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻**
- **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00733 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Since KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, the concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ is:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.00733}{0.2} \approx 0.03665 \, \text{M}
  \]

- **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻, the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.00561}{0.2} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M}
  \]

---

### **Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH**
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{HPO₄²⁻}, \, K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}
\]  
The pKa₂ is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(K_a2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]  
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.03665}\right)
\]  
The ratio is:  
\[
\frac{0.02805}{0.03665} \approx 0.766
\]  
\[
\log(0.766) \approx -0.114
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 - 0.114 = 7.096
\]

---

### **Step 3: Use the third dissociation to find [PO₄³⁻]**
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \, K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]  
The expression for \( K_a3 \) is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.096} \approx 8.03 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.03 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
Calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805) \approx 5.049 \times 10^{-14}
\]  
Divide by the denominator:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.03 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Match the closest option**
The calculated concentration of \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\) is approximately \(6.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which is closest to **option A (6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M)**.

---

**Answer: A**
