Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question involves wave functions and normalization. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

So the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' from the options.

Wait, right, the wave function should be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1. But in this case, the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, because when they measured, particles were only found there. Or wait, no, the wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3? Or is that just where the measurements were taken?

Wait, no, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but when they measure, particles are only found between 1 and 3. So that means that the wave function must be zero outside 1 to 3. Because if the wave function were non-zero elsewhere, there would be some probability of finding the particle there. Oh, but wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, that seems to be a complex function. Wait, but if the wave function is given as that, maybe it's only non-zero in the region 1<=x<=3? Because the problem states that when measuring, none were found outside that region. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region, and non-zero inside.

But wait, the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, if this is the case, perhaps it's the entire function, but maybe it's only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Because otherwise, the integral over all x would be infinite if the function doesn't go to zero somewhere. Hmm, but wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, sqrt(1+x) is real when x >= -1. So the function is defined for x >=-1. But the measurements are between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by a step function that is 1 between x=1 and x=3 and 0 elsewhere. But the question says the wave function is described as that expression in the part where it can exist. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, and the given function applies in that interval.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, that's not a standard form. Usually, wave functions are real or have some specific form. Wait, maybe I should think about the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from -infinity to infinity must equal 1. But since ψ(x) is zero outside 1 to 3, the integral is only over 1 to 3.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) – 0.5i ] multiplied by its complex conjugate. The complex conjugate of ψ would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So multiplying them together gives (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.25) + i*(...), but wait, no, when you multiply (a - 0.5i)(a + 0.5i), it's a² + (0.5)^2, so a² + 0.25.

Wait, wait, no: (a/sqrt(1+x) – 0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) – (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)^2*(-1). Wait, no, perhaps better to compute modulus squared directly.

Alternatively, the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you multiply (x - iy)(x + iy) = x² + y². So here, x is a/sqrt(1+x), y is 0.5. So |ψ|^2 is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

So the integral over x from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So the integral becomes ∫[a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute that integral. 

First, break it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each part:

The first integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a² ≈ 0.721 → a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849. 

Looking at the options, B is 0.85. That seems to match.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the wave function's form? Because the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But in the normalization, I considered the modulus squared as (a²/(1+x) + 0.25). Is that correct?

Yes, because when you have a complex number (x + iy), the modulus squared is x² + y². So in this case, x is a/sqrt(1+x), and y is 0.5. So yes, the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. That's correct.

So the value of a is approximately 0.849, which is very close to option B, 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the integral. Let's recompute:

The integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

The first part: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. That's a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² ln(2).

Second part: 0.25*(3 -1 )= 0.5.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7212.

a = sqrt(0.7212) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the normalization condition for the wave function in quantum mechanics. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

and it is non-zero only between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), as particles are not found outside this region. The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle is 1, which means:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since \(\psi(x) = 0\) outside \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of \(\psi(x)\) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
\]

The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\), so:

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two parts gives:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is very close to \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
