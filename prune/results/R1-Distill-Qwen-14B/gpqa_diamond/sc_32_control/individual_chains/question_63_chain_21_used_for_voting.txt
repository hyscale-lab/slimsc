Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states after absorbing a photon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the quantum mechanics concepts, but I'll try my best.

Alright, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. So I'm guessing it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy levels, not just one. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. They're asking what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, so the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think implies that it's in the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, the ground state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1? Wait, for a diatomic, the rotational quantum number J starts at 0, but the ground state for rotation is J=0. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0).

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I'm trying to figure out what that next state is. Oh, wait, in the rotational-vibrational model, the energy levels are quantized and given by some combination of vibrational and rotational states. The energy levels can be approximated by the formula E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy for a given quantum number v is (v + 1/2)ℏω, and the rotational energy is something like (J(J+1)ℏ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the molecule is initially at v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be either increasing v to 1 (vibrational excitation) or J to 1 (rotational excitation). But which one has lower energy? Let me calculate the energies of these two possibilities.

First, the vibrational energy when v=0 is (0 + 1/2)ℏω. If the molecule absorbs a photon that causes a vibrational transition to v=1, the energy change ΔE_vibrational would be from (½ℏω) to (3/2ℏω), so ΔE = ℏω. Alternatively, for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy change would be from 0 to (1*(1+1)ℏ²)/(2I) = (2ℏ²)/(2I) = ℏ²/(I).

So I need to compare ℏω and ℏ²/(I) to see which is smaller. The photon with energy corresponding to the smaller ΔE would be the next state. Wait, no, wait: the molecule can absorb a photon with any energy that matches a transition to a higher state. But the question says, what's the momentum of the photon needed to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increment, right?

So I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot, and see which is smaller. The photon that causes the smaller energy transition would be the one needed.

Wait, but let me think about the model. In the non-rigid rotor model, sometimes the vibrational and rotational energies are considered together, perhaps as a kind of coupled state. But maybe the problem is considering a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes. Hmm, no, perhaps the transition is either vibrational or rotational, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest state, so if it's in the ground state, the next possible state could be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Or perhaps a combination like v=1 and J=1. But I think the next lowest state after the ground state is either the first vibrational or the first rotational level, whichever is lower. So I have to calculate both.

Let me compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

First, let's compute I, the moment of inertia. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, wait, 20 amu and 2 amu. So Mx=20, My=2. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But amu is atomic mass units, which I need to convert into kilograms for SI units. One atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that. 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ around 3.013e-27 kg.

Wait, more accurately: 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.660539 = let's see, 1.818 * 1.66 is approximately 3.013. So 3.013e-27 kg.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. 1.818 * 1.660539 = ?

Well, 1.8 * 1.66 is 2.988. 0.018 * 1.66 is 0.02988. So total is approximately 3.01788e-27 kg.

So I = μ r². The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2 * 1e-10 meters = 2e-10 m.

So r squared is (2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = μ r² = (3.013e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²) = 1.2052e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy change ΔE_rot is from J=0 to J=1.

The rotational energy E_rot is given by (ℏ²/(2I)) * J(J+1). So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, it's (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2.

So ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = 2*(ℏ²/(2I)) = ℏ² / I.

Wait, wait: E_rot = [ℏ² J (J+1)] / (2I). So when J=0, E=0. For J=1, E_rot = ℏ² (2) / (2I) = ℏ² / I. So ΔE_rot is ℏ² / I.

Now, let's compute ℏ² / I.

ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ℏ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ about 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Now, I is 1.2052e-46 kg·m².

So ℏ² / I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.2052e-46 ≈ approximately (1.112 / 1.2052) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 1.2052 ≈ 0.922.

So ℏ²/(I) ≈ 0.922e-22 J.

But wait, that's the rotational energy change, ΔE_rot ≈ 0.922e-22 J.

Now, the vibrational energy change when v increases by 1 is ΔE_vibrational = ℏω.

Given ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ℏω = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 4e14 1/s = 4.218e-20 J.

So now, comparing ΔE_rot ≈ 9.22e-23 J and ΔE_vibrational ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, wait, no: 0.922e-22 is 9.22e-23 J. And 4.218e-20 J is much larger. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So the photon needed to cause the molecule to transition to the next lowest state is the one with energy equal to the rotational transition, ΔE_rot = 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. So the photon's energy is related to its momentum via E = p c, where c is the speed of light. Since for a photon, E = pc, so p = E / c.

So p = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.073e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, but wait a minute, that gives a momentum way smaller than any of the options given. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia perhaps. Let me double-check.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Converting μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ let me compute step by step.

1.8 * 1.6605 = 3.0. 0.01818 * 1.6605 ≈ approximately 0.029999.

So total ≈ 3.02999 kg? Wait, no, wait, 1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889, and 0.01818 * 1.6605 = approx 0.02999, so total is about 3.01889e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, no, 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.018e-27 kg, correct.

So I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Then, ℏ² / I = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, that's what I had earlier. So that's the rotational energy change.

But that gives the photon energy as 9.21e-23 J. So the momentum p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. But looking at the options, the smallest p is 1.4e-28 N·s (option D). Oh wait, but the units here are in kg·m/s. Wait, 1 N·s is equal to 1 kg·m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to that. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying what the next state is. Maybe the molecule transitions from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to v=1, J=0, but that requires a vibrational transition, which has higher energy. Or perhaps to J=1, v=0, which requires lower energy as calculated.

But according to that, the required photon energy is about 9e-23 J, which is much lower than the vibrational transition but leads to a small momentum.

But the options don't go that low. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the energy calculation.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps the model isn't just considering pure rotation or pure vibration, but a combination. Maybe the molecule could go from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which is a pure vibrational transition, or perhaps to (v=0, J=1), which is pure rotational, or maybe even a combination like (v=1, J=1). But which of these is the next lowest state.

Wait, but the energies would be as follows:

E(v=1, J=0) = E_vibrational(v=1) + E_rotational(J=0) = (3/2)ℏω + 0.

E(v=0, J=1) = (1/2)ℏω + (ℏ²/(2I)) * (2) → E = (1/2)ℏω + (ℏ²)/(I).

Wait, no, wait: for v=0, J=1, the energy is E_rot = [ (ℏ²) (1)(2) ] / (2I) ) = ℏ²/(I).

Plus any vibrational energy. Wait, no, in the fundamental state, v=0, J=0, so the next possible state would be either v=1 (J=0), or J=1 (v=0), whichever has lower energy.

So E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2)ℏω.

E(v=0, J=1) = (1/2)ℏω + ℏ²/(I) → because for J=1, E_rot is (ℏ²)(2)/(2I) ) = ℏ²/(I). Plus the vibrational term for v=0 is ½ ℏω.

So to find the next state with the lowest energy, we compare which of E(v=1, J=0) and E(v=0, J=1) is lower.

Compute both.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2)ℏω = (3/2)*6.626e-34 * 4e14 → wait, no, wait, ℏ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. So ℏω is 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J. So (3/2)*4.218e-20 = 6.327e-20 J.

E(v=0, J=1) = (1/2)ℏω + ℏ²/(I).

We have ℏω =4.218e-20 J. So half of that is 2.109e-20 J.

Plus ℏ²/(I) is 9.21e-23 J as before.

So E(v=0, J=1) = 2.109e-20 + 9.21e-23 ≈ 2.109e-20 + 0.0921e-20 ≈ 2.201e-20 J.

Comparing to E(v=1, J=0) which is 6.327e-20 J. So E(v=0, J=1) is lower, so the next state is (v=0, J=1), and the photon energy needed is 2.201e-20 J minus the initial state's energy. Wait, the initial state's energy is E_initial = (½)ℏω (v=0) + 0 (J=0). So the photon needs to provide the difference between (v=0, J=1) and (v=0, J=0), which is ℏ²/(I) = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, that's the same as before.

So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J. Then, the momentum is p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are that small. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. So perhaps I missed something here.

Wait, did I miscalculate the moment of inertia? Let me double-check.

Bond length R =2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R^2 = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) ) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

μ in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Yes, that's correct.

So ℏ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 /1.207e-46.

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.207) *1e-22 ≈0.922e-22 =9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J, which gives a momentum p=9.22e-23 J/(3e8 m/s) =3.07e-31 kg·m/s=3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the selection of the transition. Maybe the next state isn't (v=0, J=1) but instead a vibrational transition. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I confused the model. The quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor) implies that the bond length can change, so the moment of inertia is not fixed. But perhaps in this problem, it's modeled as a rigid rotor. Wait, the question says "non-rigid rotor model". Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure if that changes anything in this calculation. Maybe the non-rigid rotor model allows for changes in bond length, which affects the moment of inertia, but in the context of a transition, perhaps the change in bond length is considered in the vibrational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes. But that's probably more complicated, and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational photon's momentum and see if that matches any options. The vibrational energy change is ℏω=4.218e-20 J. Momentum p=4.218e-20 J/(3e8 m/s)=1.406e-28 kg·m/s=1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct transition is the vibrational one, and I made a mistake in earlier analysis.

Wait, why would that be? Because when I compared the energies, the rotational transition had a lower energy (9.2e-23 J) than the vibrational (4.2e-20 J). So the next state should be the rotational one. But why would the answer be the vibrational photon?

Unless perhaps I messed up the comparison. Let me compute both energies numerically again.

ΔE_rot ≈9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_vibrational≈4.2e-20 J.

So 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition is lower energy. So why isn't the momentum 3e-31 N·s? Because that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, another thought. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy. The rotational energy for a diatomic molecule is given by E_rot = (J(J+1)ℏ²)/(2I). So when J=0, E=0; J=1, E_rot = (2ℏ²)/(2I)= ℏ²/(I). So that's correct.

Hmm... perhaps the problem is not about the rotational-vibration model but treats the molecule as a 3D rotor in vibration. Or perhaps I'm confusing the rigid rotor approximation with the non-rigid one.

Wait, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia isn't fixed because the bond length can change, which is accounted for in the vibrational energy. But in that case, when the molecule absorbs a photon, the energy might be used both for vibration and rotation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the next state, which is a combination of both, but I don't think that would be the case in the quantum model I'm familiar with.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where both J and v change, but that would be a more complex calculation, and I don't have the necessary formulas for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition and ignores rotation, which would explain why the answer is option D.

Wait, but why would that be the case? The question states it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so it should account for both. Hmm.

Another approach: Maybe the photon's energy must correspond to the difference between the two states, which includes both rotational and vibrational changes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next state regardless of whether it's higher in rotational or vibrational energy. But that would complicate things, and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. Let me check that again.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

μ is (20 *2)/(22) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu → 1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

I=μ R² =3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.207e-46 kg·m².

That's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem considers the molecule as a rigid rotor, so the bond length doesn't change, and thus the moment of inertia is fixed. But I don't think that affects the current calculation because I used the given bond length.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion. Let me recheck.

1 amu = 1.660539e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg = let's compute that accurately.

1.818 *1.660539= 

1.8 *1.660539 =2.989.

0.018 *1.660539=0.02989.

Total is 2.989 +0.02989=3.01889.

So μ=3.01889e-27 kg.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the rotational transition is higher than the vibrational one? But my initial calculation shows that the rotational energy change is much smaller than the vibrational change.

Wait, that can't be. Because 9.2e-23 J is way less than 4.2e-20 J. So the photon energy for the rotational transition is much lower than for the vibrational.

But the options given don't have any such small momentum. The smallest option is D:1.4e-28 Ns, which corresponds to 1.4e-28 kg·m/s. Let's compute the energy for that p.

Energy E_photon = p c = (1.4e-28 kg·m/s) * (3e8 m/s) =4.2e-20 J.

Which is exactly the energy of the vibrational transition. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why? Because the rotational transition requires a smaller photon energy, so it's a lower energy transition, so the photon momentum would be smaller, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, and the rotational model is a red herring.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in which transition is allowed. Maybe the first transition isn't to J=1, but to a higher vibrational state. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps in the rotational-vibration model, the states are labeled as (v, J), and the energy levels are quantized as E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J). So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which of these has lower energy?

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2)ℏω +0 = (3/2)(1.05457e-34 J·s)(4e14 1/s) = (3/2)*4.218e-20 J=6.327e-20 J.

E(v=0, J=1) = (½)ℏω + (ℏ²/(I)) = (½)(4.218e-20 J) + 9.21e-23 J = 2.109e-20 J +9.21e-23 J≈2.19e-20 J.

So E(v=0, J=1) is lower than E(v=1, J=0). So the next state is (v=0, J=1), and the photon energy needed is 2.19e-20 J minus the initial state's energy.

Wait, initial state is (v=0, J=0), whose energy is (½)ℏω + 0 = 2.109e-20 J. So the change from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) is ΔE= E_final - E_initial = [ (½)ℏω + (ℏ²/(I)) ] - (½)ℏω = ℏ²/(I) =9.21e-23 J.

So the photon energy is 9.21e-23 J, which gives p=9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s=3.07e-31 N·s.

But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor model, not the non-rigid. In the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, so I is fixed, and perhaps the rotational energy is treated differently. But I'm not sure if that changes anything here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon momentum for the transition that increases both v and J. But that would require a more complex calculation, and I don't know the exact formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think again: The rotational energy is (ℏ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So for J=0, it's 0. For J=1, it's (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2 = ℏ²/I. So yes, the ΔE is ℏ²/I.

Hmm. So why are the options all much larger than my calculated 3e-31 Ns? Maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait, the options are in N·s, which is correct for momentum. 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ℏ²/(I). Let me recalculate that.

ℏ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ℏ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

I is 1.207e-46 kg·m².

So ℏ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = (1.112 / 1.207) *1e-22 ≈0.922e-22 =9.22e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So the photon energy is 9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's momentum p = E/c =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't include this. The closest option is D)1.4e-28 Ns, which is way bigger.

Hmm. So I'm either missing something, or perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to a state where both v and J increase. Like from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1). But that would require more energy than either transition alone.

Wait, let me compute that. E(v=1, J=1) = (3/2)ℏω + [ℏ²/(I)] * (2) → because J=1: (1*2)*ℏ²/(2I) = (2 ℏ²)/(2I)= ℏ²/I.

So E(v=1, J=1) = (3/2)ℏω + ℏ²/(I) =6.327e-20 +9.22e-23 ≈6.419e-20 J.

E_initial = (½)ℏω =2.109e-20 J.

ΔE=6.419e-20 - 2.109e-20 =4.31e-20 J.

p=4.31e-20 /3e8 =1.437e-28 kg·m/s=1.437e-28 N·s.

Which matches option B:2.3e-27 (no), option D:1.4e-28 (yes). So option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the molecule transition to (v=1, J=1) instead of (v=0, J=1) which is lower in energy?

Ah, because (v=0, J=1) is a lower-energy state than (v=1, J=0), but perhaps the next state that requires the least energy is (v=0, J=1). So why is the problem expecting the photon to cause a transition to (v=1, J=1)?

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says, the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible ΔE. Which is (v=0, J=1), requiring 9.22e-23 J.

But according to the options, that's not present, but the vibrational transition's ΔE is 4.218e-20 J, which gives p=1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational possibility. But why?

Wait, maybe the question is using the rigid rotor approximation, where the rotational energy is considered, but the vibrational energy is considered separately. So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state is (v=1, J=0), which requires a photon of 4.218e-20 J, which gives p=1.4e-28 Ns.

That's option D.

But why would the problem ignore the lower-energy rotational transition? Because perhaps the model used in the problem considers only the vibrational transitions and not the rotational, or perhaps because in some models rotational transitions are less probable, but the question specifically says to model it with the rotation-vibration model.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. But given that option D matches the vibrational transition, which is 4.218e-20 J, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule must change both vibrational and rotational states, but that would require a higher energy. But in that case, the energy would be higher than both, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the next state. Maybe the next state isn't the lowest in energy but the next in sequence in terms of quantum numbers, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length changes, which affects the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure how that would change the calculation.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition to the next energy level, which in the rotation-vibration model would be the first excited state, which is a combination of both, but I don't know the exact formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next state, which could be a change in vibration and a change in rotation, but that's a more advanced topic.

But given the options, and the fact that option D corresponds to the vibrational transition, perhaps that's what the question expects.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the ground state, corresponding to \( v = 0 \) (vibrational ground state) and \( J = 0 \) (rotational ground state). The next possible states are either \( v = 1, J = 0 \) (vibrational excitation) or \( v = 0, J = 1 \) (rotational excitation). The energy of these transitions is calculated to identify the lowest energy increment.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   - The vibrational energy is given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \) for \( v = 0 \), and \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \) for \( v = 1 \).
   - The energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}) \times (4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   - The rotational energy is given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2I} \), where \( I = \mu r^2 \) is the moment of inertia.
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{22 \, \text{amu}} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms:
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.660539 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
   - The bond length \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
   - For \( J = 0 \), \( E_{\text{rot}} = 0 \). For \( J = 1 \), \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The rotational transition is lower in energy.

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
     This value is much smaller than the options provided and does not match any of them.

   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
     This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
Although the rotational transition requires less energy, the calculated momentum for this transition does not match any of the provided options. The vibrational transition, while requiring more energy, corresponds to option **D**. Therefore, the problem likely expects the vibrational transition to be considered.
