Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember from my studies that molecules can vibrate and rotate, and these motions are quantized. The question is about a photon being absorbed causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when a photon is absorbed, it must transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh right, the next state would be the first excited state. But I need to figure out what changes in the quantum numbers for rotation and vibration.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but non-rigid allows for some stretching, so it's more about vibration. Or wait, maybe the question combines both rotation and vibration aspects. Hmm, the problem mentions both bond length and angular frequency, so I think it's considering both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model—maybe it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are a product of rotational and vibrational contributions.

The molecule is currently in the fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher vibrational or rotational state. But the question is asking for the photon's momentum that would cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, what's the next possible state? The next lowest energy state would involve the minimal increase in energy. So considering the energy levels, the vibrational energy is given by (n + 1/2)ħω, and rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next lowest state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which transition requires less energy? Because the energy for rotation depends on J, and for vibration on v.

Let me compute the energies for both possible transitions.

First, compute the vibrational energy change. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.054e-34 J·s. The angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

ΔE_vib for v=0 to v=1 is (1) * ħ * ω = (1)(1.054e-34)(4e14) ≈ 4.216e-20 J.

Now the rotational energy change. The moment of inertia I is μ r². μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So Mx = 20 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg. My = 2 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-27 kg.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27). Let me calculate that.

First, numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.02 * 1e-53 = 1.102e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.102e-52) / (3.652e-26) ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy for J=0 is 0. For J=1, it's (1)(2)(ħ²)/(2I) = (2)(ħ²)/(2I) = ħ² / I.

Compute ħ²: (1.054e-34)^2 ≈ 1.11e-68 J²·s².

So, ħ²/(I) = (1.11e-68) / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that's the rotational energy for J=1. So the energy required for the rotational transition is 9.2e-23 J.

Compare that to the vibrational transition, which was 4.2e-20 J. Oh, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon would cause a rotation change rather than a vibration change.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy is probably J=1, v=0, because the energy required for J=1 is lower than for v=1.

So the molecule will transition from J=0, v=0 to J=1, v=0. The energy difference is the rotational energy ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, does the model allow for transitions where both rotational and vibrational states change? Or is the next state going to be either a higher vibration or rotation. Since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the smallest ΔE.

So the photon must supply 9.2e-23 J of energy.

Now, the photon's energy is E_photon = h * f = p * c, where p is the momentum of the photon (since for photons, E = pc). So p = E_photon / c.

Wait, but wait, photons have energy E = hf and momentum p = E/c. So yes.

So p = (ΔE_rot) / c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s).

Calculating that: 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = approximately 3.067e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait—this doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the rotational energy for J=1 is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, I think I messed up earlier calculations. Let me recalculate the rotational energy.

Let me recompute I:

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = (40) /22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, no, wait—wait! Oh, I messed up the calculation earlier. I think I confused the way to compute μ. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) expressed in kg.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So Mx = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My = 2 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 kg * 3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27) kg.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator = 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.02 * 1e-53 = 1.102e-52 kg^2.

Denominator = 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = (3.32 + 0.332) e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.102e-52 / 3.652e-26 = approx (1.102 / 3.652) * 1e-26 kg.

1.102 / 3.652 ≈ 0.3017 → 0.3017e-26 kg = 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, that's what I had before, so I didn't make a mistake there.

Moment of inertia I = μ r². r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy for J=1 is (1)(2) ħ²/(2I) → (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, no: the formula is (J(J+1) ħ²) / (2I) → J=1, so it's (2 * ħ²)/(2I) → (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/I.

Wait, no, because J(J+1) is 2 for J=1. So energy is (2 ħ²) / (2I) = (2* ħ²) / (2I) → ħ²/I. So yeah.

So E_rot = ħ²/I.

Compute ħ²: (1.0545718e-34 J s)^2 ≈ (1.054e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 ≈ approximately 9.21e-23 J.

So the energy difference is 9.21e-23 J.

So the photon's energy must be E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p is E_photon / c, since E=pc for photons. c is approx 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s → 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

B) 2.3e-27 kg m/s.

Wait, my calculation of p is 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns. None of the options match this. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in approach.

Wait another way: perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state could be the next higher state, which could be either a vibration or rotation transition. So which requires less energy, the rotational or vibrational transition?

Earlier, I calculated the vibrational transition as requiring about 4.2e-20 J, and the rotational transition as requiring ~9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon should have p corresponding to 9.2e-23 J.

So p = E/c → 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options are that small. Wait the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 → 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

B) 2.3e-27.

C) 1.1e-27.

D)1.4e-28.

Hmmm, so perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the question is about the fundamental vibrational state but considering the rotational state as J=0. So perhaps the next state is when the rotational state increases.

Wait, perhaps the model considered here is the non-rigid rotor, which includes both rotation and vibration. Or maybe it's the rigid rotor with vibration. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is in the ground state, and the next state is the first excited state, which could be either vibration or rotation. But the question says, to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's the one that requires the least energy.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate both possibilities and see which one matches the options.

So for the rotational transition, E_rot = 9.2e-23 J. For the vibrational transition E_vib = 4.2e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that small. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Perhaps the question is about the Raman effect, where the photon's angular momentum contributes to the rotational state. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the model assumes that the molecule is in a rigid rotor state, and the energy levels are solely rotational, but I'm not certain. Or perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition, but I don't see how that would match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me recalculate that.

I'll recompute I: μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = (40 amu²) / 22 amu = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert 1.818 amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = approx 2.997e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 2.997e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.997e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.1988e-46 kg m².

Compute E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) for J=1? Wait no, the formula is E_rot = [ J (J+1) ħ² ] / (2 I )

For J=1, E_rot = [2 ħ² ] / (2 I ) = ħ²/(I )

So E_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.1988e-46) = (1.112e-68) / 1.1988e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before. So the calculation seems correct.

So the photon's momentum is about 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But the options don't include anything that small. Perhaps I misinterpreted the question.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state which is the lowest state. Maybe it's considering a transition to the next vibrational level, but that needs higher energy. If I proceed with that, then the photon's momentum is E/c = 4.2e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg m/s → 1.4e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which matches this.

But why would the question suggest the next state with the lowest energy? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, but perhaps the question isn't considering rotation. Or perhaps the model being used is only considering vibration.

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So it's a combination. So the molecule is in the lowest state of both vibration and rotation. So the next possible state could be the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (v=0, J=1). But which is lower in energy?

The vibrational energy is (v + 1/2) hbar w. The rotational energy is (J(J+1) ħ² )/(2 I ).

The energy difference for vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ħ w. For rotational, from J=0 to J=1, it's ħ²/(2 I).

So compute both.

Compute ħ w: ħ is ~1.0545718e-34 J·s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

E_rot = ħ²/(2 I ). Wait, no: the rotational energy for J=1 is (1*2 * ħ² )/( 2 I ) → (2 ħ² )/(2 I ) → ħ² / I.

Wait I think I got that wrong earlier. Because E_rot is [J (J+1) ħ² ] / (2I) → for J=1, E_rot is (2 ħ²) / (2I) → ħ² / I.

So E_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.1988e-46) ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

So the vibrational transition requires higher energy than the rotational. So the next state would be the rotational one. But the options don't have anything matching that.

Hmm, perhaps the question is wrong, or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking about the photon's momentum that would cause the molecule to transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first possible state, which would be J=1, v=0. So the energy needed is E_rot = 9.24e-23 J.

So p = E /c → 9.24e-23 /3e8 = 3.08e-31 kg m/s → 3.08e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are this small. So perhaps the mistake is in the model.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the bond length in a different way. Wait, the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which I used correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering only the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation. So that the photon's momentum is 4.2e-20 J /3e8 m/s = 1.4e-28 kg m/s → which is option D.

But why would the question mention the rotation-vibration model if rotation is being ignored? That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a vibrational one with a change in rotational state as well. But that's more complicated.

Wait, another thought: the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0). The next state could be the first excited vibrational state (v=1), which would require the photon's energy. But then, why not the rotational state? Because the molecule is in the ground rotational state (J=0), the next state would be J=1.

But the vibrational transition requires more energy. So the lowest possible energy state would be J=1, which requires less energy. So the photon should have momentum corresponding to that.

But again, none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibrational model, which is the next state in the sequence of states, regardless of energy. But no, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the energy of the photon that causes a transition in the vibrational state, not the rotational. But why?

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. Which would correspond to E = p * c = 1.4e-28 * 3e8 = 4.2e-20 J. Which is exactly the E_vib I computed earlier.

So if the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J, then p = 4.2e-20 /3e8 = 1.4e-28 Ns → option D.

But why is that the case? Because perhaps the model expects only the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation, but that seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state with the lowest possible energy is the next vibrational state, but that would mean that the rotational transition requires even less energy, which would be lower. So the photon's energy would be for the rotational transition. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but for some reason the energy is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot. Let me recheck.

I think I might have used the wrong formula. The formula for rotational energy is E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ² ) / (2 I )

For J=1, that's (2 ħ² )/(2 I ) ) = ħ² / I.

Wait, so that's correct.

Wait, let me compute E_rot again with accurate numbers.

Calculating I:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu ≈ 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = 11.028 * 1e-53 = 1.1028e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.1028e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = 3.017e-27 kg.

I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

E_rot = (1 * 2) * (ħ²) / (2 * I ) = (2 * (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2068e-46 )

= (2 * 1.112e-68 ) / (2.4136e-46 ) → (2.224e-68) / 2.4136e-46 = 9.213e-23 J.

Yes, same as before.

So the photon's energy is 9.213e-23 J. p = E/c = 9.213e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 Ns.

So this is 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct approach is not being considered in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the momentum of the photon that would cause the molecule to transition to the next possible state, but the next state is in vibration, not rotation.

If that's the case, then the photon's momentum would be 4.2e-20 J /3e8 m/s = 1.4e-28 kg m/s → option D.

So why would the question suggest the next state with the lowest possible energy? Because the rotational transition requires lower energy. So unless the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, but that would be inconsistent with it being a rotation-vibration model.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of rotational and vibrational changes. But that's not the case for the next lowest state.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state, and the next state is the first rotational state, which would require less energy than the vibrational state, but the photon's momentum isn't in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches the vibrational transition. So perhaps the problem expects that answer.

But why? Because perhaps the question is only considering the vibration and not the rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used assumes that the molecule is a rigid rotor, and the rotational states are considered separately. Or maybe the given options don't account for rotational transitions and only consider vibrational.

In that case, the correct answer would be D) 1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \).  
  \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).  
  \( M_x = 3.32 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}, \, M_y = 3.32 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).

- **Bond length**: \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

- **Angular frequency of vibration**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).

- **Reduced mass**:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(3.32 \times 10^{-26})(3.32 \times 10^{-27})}{3.32 \times 10^{-26} + 3.32 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
  \]

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu r^2 = (3.017 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
  \]

### Energy Calculations:
1. **Vibrational energy difference**:  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.054 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Rotational energy difference**:  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Comparison of Transitions:
- The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  
- Since the rotational transition requires less energy, it would be the next state with the lowest possible energy. However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \), which is:  
  \[
  p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
  \]

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated rotational momentum and the provided options, it appears the question is asking for the momentum corresponding to a vibrational transition. For the vibrational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.216 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.405 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]  
This matches **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
