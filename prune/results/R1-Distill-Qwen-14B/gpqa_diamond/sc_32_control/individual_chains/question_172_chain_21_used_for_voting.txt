Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? Oh wait, and LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means that in each small region, the gas behaves as if it's in thermal equilibrium. So that probably means the Boltzmann distribution applies here because it deals with energy levels and temperature.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation here refers to the atoms being in a higher energy state. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I remember that the probability of an atom being in an excited state depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the states. 

The Boltzmann equation comes into play, right? The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The equation is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2 in the same energy level. So, let's denote the number of excited atoms in star_1 as N1 and in star_2 as N2. So, N1 = 2 * N2. But wait, the ratio would be N1/N2 = 2. Alternatively, considering the same energy level, the ratio would be (using the Boltzmann factor) exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) and exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)). 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because the ratio N_upper/N_lower depends on the temperature. Since the question is about the same energy level, perhaps I'm thinking in terms of the same transition? Or maybe each star has its own ratio for the same transition.

Let me rephrase. For star_1, the ratio of the excited population to the ground (or lower) population is higher. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is R1 = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2, and for star_2, R2 = 1? Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited. Or wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is higher in star_1. So the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population would be higher in star_1.

So, for star_1: R1 = (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2.

For star_2: R2 = (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = 1.

Because if star_2's excitation is lower, the ratio is 1, and star_1's is twice that, so 2.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the general case. Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2, where E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. The ratio for each star would be based on their own temperatures.

So, R = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both stars (since they're both iron atoms, same transition), then g_upper/g_lower would be the same for both. So the ratio between R1 and R2 would be exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But according to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait no, because the problem states that the excited level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, let me get this straight. The number of excited atoms in star_1 (N1) is twice that of star_2 (N2). So N1 = 2 N2.

But each star has its own ratio. So assuming that the lower level is the same for both, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio N_upper/N_lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is N_upper/N_lower for each star. So let's say for star_1, R1 = N1_upper / N1_lower = 2. For star_2, R2 = N2_upper / N2_lower = 1. Because the problem says that star_1's atoms are twice as excited, so their ratio is twice.

So, R1 = 2 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

R2 = 1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but since (g2/g1) is the same for both stars (same transition), I can take the ratio of R1 and R2.

So R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)).

Wait, because exponents subtract when you divide. So, R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ).

Given that R1 is 2 and R2 is 1, R1/R2 is 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * [ (1/(T2)) - (1/(T1)) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me double-check that.

Because (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

But I don't know the exact value of ΔE/(k). The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. And k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, wait a minute. Wait, k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1.

So substituting that back into the equation:

ln(2) = 1 * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would be the correct equation.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but when I derived it, yes, that's right.

So the correct answer should be D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key is to apply the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For this problem, the statistical weights \( g_{\text{upper}}/g_{\text{lower}} \) are assumed to be the same for both stars since the transition involves the same energy levels in iron atoms.

The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = 1.
\]

Taking the ratio of these two expressions:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{2}{1} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant \( k \) is \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
