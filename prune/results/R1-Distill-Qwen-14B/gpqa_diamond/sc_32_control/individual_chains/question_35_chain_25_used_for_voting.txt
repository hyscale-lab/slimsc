Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, specifically the Y-component, Ay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π). Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for particles like electrons or muons (which are similar, I think) are often represented using Pauli matrices. So maybe S here is one of the Pauli matrices.

Looking at the matrix S: the first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! The Pauli matrices. Let me recall: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So S here is the Pauli Y matrix. So S = σy.

So Ay = c * σy. And c is h/(4π). Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, right? Because the spin operators S are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 particles. Oh wait, but in this case, Ay is c multiplied by S, which is σy. So let me make sure about the constants.

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator components are typically given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So for example, Sy would be (ħ/2) σy. But in this problem, Ay is c multiplied by S, and c is h/(4π). Hmm, let's compute what that gives us.

Wait, Planck's constant h is equal to 2π ħ. So h = 2π ħ. So h/(4π) is (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2. Oh okay, so then Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. Which makes sense because the Pauli matrices when multiplied by ħ/2 give the spin operators.

So the matrix Ay would then be (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute that.

(ħ/2)*0 is 0 in the top left. (ħ/2)*(-i) is -iħ/2 in the top right. (ħ/2)*i is iħ/2 in the bottom left. And (ħ/2)*0 is 0 in the bottom right. So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -iħ/2],
  [iħ/2, 0] ]

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So let's get into that.

Eigenvalues a satisfy the equation Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ [ -a, -iħ/2 ],
  [ iħ/2, -a ] ]

So the determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) ) = a² - [ (-i)(i)(ħ²/4) ) ]

Wait, (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = (-i)(i) (ħ²/4) ) [because (iħ/2)*( -iħ/2 ) equals (i*(-i))(ħ^2/4) ) ].

Calculating (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - ( (1)(ħ²/4) ) = a² - (ħ²/4).

Set this equal to zero: a² = (ħ²/4) → a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), right? So substituting that in, a would be ± (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). Oh wait, no, let me compute that properly.

Wait, ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2, which equals ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, let me double-check my calculation. The determinant was [[-a, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, -a]] so the determinant is a² - ( (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) ). The product of the off-diagonal terms is (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = (-i)(i)(ħ²/4) ) = (i² is -1, so (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -( -1 ) = 1. So the product is (ħ²/4). So the determinant is a² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → a² = (ħ^2)/4 → a = ± ħ/2. Since ħ is h/(2π), ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Hmm, but the eigenvalues I'm getting are purely real, right? Because they're ± something, but that something is a real number.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalues for spin matrices are real. So if Ay has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, which are real numbers, then their imaginary parts are zero. So the options are talking about the eigenvalues as possibly complex, but that can't be right because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Because S (Pauli Y matrix) is Hermitian, and c is real, so Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im eigenvalues are ±2πh, Re ±h/(4π). But that would mean the eigenvalues are complex numbers, which can't be right because Ay is Hermitian. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Im eigenvalues ±1/2, Re ±1. Again, implies complex eigenvalues. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, so let's think. A² is the square of the operator. The eigenfunctions of A² (for angular momentum) are the same as those of the total angular momentum squared, which for spin-1/2 particles would have eigenvalues s(s+1) ħ², where s=1/2. So any eigenfunction of Ay will also be an eigenfunction of A² because A² commutes with all components of A. But does it commute with Az? Well, in quantum mechanics, [Ay, Az] = iħ (or something like that), so they don't commute. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what this means. The basis functions are typically the eigenvectors, so the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So D would be correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but looking back: the operator Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors (unless they're degenerate, but they aren't here). So the eigenvectors do form a basis. So statement D is correct. So both C and D could be correct statements, but let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's go back.

So the correct eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π). So the real parts are ± h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are incorrect because they state the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts.

So looking at the options again, the correct statements are either C or D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought before, since [A², Ay] = 0, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, so the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think this refers to whether the eigenvectors form a basis for the space on which Ay acts. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and it has two linearly independent eigenvectors (as it's diagonalizable since it's Hermitian), the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. Wait, but are C and D both correct?

Let me read the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So why aren't all options pointing to these?

Wait, but looking at the question, it's a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let's re-examine the options.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. So the eigenvectors of Ay are the basis for Ay's matrix representation. Yes, because any 2x2 matrix can be diagonalized (if it has two distinct eigenvalues) with its eigenvectors as the basis. So D is correct.

But wait, in the problem statement, the matrix is given as 2x2, so the eigenvectors are in a 2-dimensional space, so of course they form a basis.

So which options are correct? Let's see:

The correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), real numbers.

Only options C and D are possible. But maybe another way to look at this.

So, looking back at the options:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So the matrix operator Ay is represented in the standard basis, perhaps. But the eigenvectors form a different basis. So when you diagonalize Ay, you change the basis to the eigenvectors. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is the space on which Ay operates. So D is correct.

So which options are correct?

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So for the eigenvalues, none of the options A or B are correct because they have imaginary parts.

Option C is correct as the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Option D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So the question is, which of the options are correct statements during the calculation.

But wait, the options are presented as four choices, and only one is correct.

Looking at option C: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az."

Since A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. But they don't commute with Az, so they're not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, this is a bit ambiguous. The basis functions probably refer to the standard basis, but the eigenvectors of Ay are a different basis.

Wait, but the statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, perhaps it's trying to say that the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. Which they do, but the wording is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, the question is about which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct.

Wait, but the options are presented, and only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says, during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which statement is correct.

So the correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), with zero imaginary parts. So options A and B are incorrect.

Between C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Well, I think that's a correct statement because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps option D is incorrect. Because the matrix operator Ay is expressed in the standard basis, not necessarily in the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are a different basis, not the basis in which Ay is represented. The statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, perhaps that's not correct because the operator is represented in the standard basis, unless the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis.

Wait, but the matrix can be expressed in any basis. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The key is to find which of the four options is correct, given that the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π) and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Option C: Correct, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: Correct, because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But the options are multiple-choice with four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding option D. Maybe it's saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. But the operator's matrix is given in the standard basis, so the eigenfunctions would be a different basis. So the statement in D might be incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis functions. That is, the standard basis is different from the eigenbasis.

Wait, but the question says, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So when we compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the eigenvectors become the basis for the space. So in that sense, the statement D is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C and D are correct, but only one of the options is presented. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the question says, "which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Because maybe the matrix S is different.

Wait, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So multiplying by c = h/(4π), Ay = c * S.

So the matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, let me compute the trace and determinant again.

Trace of Ay is zero.

Determinant: (0)(0) - ( (-i h/(4π)) )( i h/(4π) )= 0 - [ (-i)(i) (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ].

(-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is - [ (1)(h^2/(16 π²)) ) ]? Wait wait, no. The determinant of Ay is product of diagonal elements minus product of off-diagonal.

Wait, no: the determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc.

So here, a = 0, d = 0.

So ad = 0. bc is ( (-i h/(4π)) )*(i h/(4π)) ) = (-i)(i) (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) = (1) * (h^2/(16 π²)) ).

So determinant is 0 - (h²/(16 π²)) ) → determinant is - h²/(16 π²).

Wait, but I thought earlier that the determinant was a² - (ħ²/4) =0, leading to a= ± ħ/2. But now I'm getting a different expression.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the eigenvalues are solutions to det(Ay - a I) =0.

Ay is:

[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

So Ay - a I is:

[ [ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π) ) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is a² - (1 * h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait, that's what I got before. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real.

So the eigenvalues have no imaginary parts. So options A and B are incorrect.

So looking back at the options, only options C and D are left.

Now, option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions are the same as those of A². So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

I think this is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct as well.

But wait, the matrix is given in a certain basis (probably the standard basis), but the eigenvectors form a different basis (the eigenbasis). So the statement in D is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the operator. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

But since the question provides only one correct option, I need to decide which is the correct statement.

Alternatively, perhaps only option C is correct. Let's evaluate each option again.

Option C: Correct. Since [A², Ay] =0, eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But [Ay, Az] ≠0, so they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay (the eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So since the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space, this is correct.

But looking at the options, both C and D are correct statements.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct, so perhaps both C and D are correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as four options, and only one is to be chosen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about option D again.

The statement says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

I think this refers to the fact that the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the space in which the operator acts. Since the operator is 2x2, the space is two-dimensional, and any two eigenvectors that are orthogonal (as they are for Hermitian operators) form a basis.

So D is correct.

So now I'm confused because both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for that.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in evaluating the statements.

Wait, looking again:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

If the question is during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct, then both C and D could be correct. But the options don't allow for that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding option D. Maybe the statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis for the matrix, meaning the matrix is diagonal in that basis, which is true. So D is correct.

But according to the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps looking at the question again: the operator is given as a 2x2 matrix, and the question is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, we find that the eigenfunctions form a basis and that they are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

So both C and D are correct. But perhaps option C is the correct choice because the other options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

But the options are:

A) Incorrect
B) Incorrect
C) Correct
D) Correct

Wait, but in the multiple-choice, usually only one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are not the same as those of A². Wait, no, because A² and Ay commute.

Wait, no. The square of the angular momentum operator commutes with each component, so they share the same eigenfunctions.

So C is correct.

So, the correct statements are C and D. But perhaps the correct answer is C.

But given the options, I think the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The matrix \( A_y \) is given by \( c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues \( a \) of \( A_y \) satisfy the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Solving this yields the eigenvalues as \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These are real numbers, meaning the eigenvalues have no imaginary parts.

2. **Option A and B:**
   - **Option A** claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
   - **Option B** claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect for the same reason.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, they cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This statement is correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) acts. Since \( A_y \) is Hermitian, its eigenvectors are orthogonal and span the space, making this statement correct.

### Conclusion:
Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct statement, **Option C** is the most relevant and directly addresses the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and other angular momentum operators.

**Answer: C**
