Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of enthalpy calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. The solutions are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is typically measured in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol). 

First, I think I need to figure out how much of each acid and base I have. Then, I'll have to see which ones will react with each other because not all of them might react. 

Let's list out the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4
- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, but maybe not both protons are available for neutralization. Oh, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in dilute solutions, the second proton might not dissociate as readily. But I think in this problem, we can assume that both protons are available since it's a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it should completely dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. 

The neutralization reaction between an acid and a base would produce water when H+ ions react with OH- ions. So, I need to find out the total moles of H+ ions from the acids and the total moles of OH- ions from the base. Then, the limiting reagent will determine how much of the reaction actually happens, and how much enthalpy change we'll have.

Let me calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with HCl:
Molarity (M) = moles / liters → moles = M × liters
HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+.
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters.
Moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4:
H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 moles of H+.
Volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L.
Molarity is 0.3 M, so moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
H+ from H2SO4 = 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Its formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L.
Molarity is 0.5 M, so moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles.
OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 moles.

So, the H+ available is 0.28 moles, and OH- available is 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water, releasing enthalpy. 

The limiting reagent here is OH- because 0.2 moles can only react with 0.2 moles of H+. So, the enthalpy change depends on how much H+ and OH- actually react.

Wait, but what's the enthalpy change per mole of H+ neutralized? I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57.3 kJ/mol (or about -13.6 kcal/mol) per mole of H+ because each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH- to form water.

Wait, let me think about the units. The options are in kcal and kJ. Oh, wait, -57.3 kJ is for one mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So each mole of acid (like HCl) would contribute -57.3 kJ, but wait, for H2SO4, since each mole gives two H+, maybe each mole contributes 2*(-57.3) kJ? No, wait wait, no. Because the neutralization of each H+ releases energy. So each mole of H+ contributes -57.3 kJ.

But let me get this straight: each mole of H+ reacting with a mole of OH- releases 57.3 kJ, so the reaction is exothermic, hence the negative sign.

So, the total H+ available is 0.28 moles, but only 0.2 moles of OH- are available. So the reaction can only proceed for 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, wait, no. Because in the reaction, H+ and OH- combine 1:1. So if we have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-, then the OH- is the limiting reagent. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

But wait, wait, no. Because the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. But the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So regardless of the source, each H+ can contribute to the reaction. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization will consume 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think again. Suppose we have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-. The reaction requires 1:1, so the OH- will get used up first, and only 0.2 H+ will get neutralized, leaving 0.08 H+.

But in reality, the H+ comes from both acids. So when the OH- is consumed, the neutralization stops. So the total enthalpy change comes from 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized.

So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but let me check the units. The options are given in kcal and kJ. Oh, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 3.8 times bigger than 11.46 kJ. Hmm, but another option is B) -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, 11.46 kJ is about 2.72 kcal because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. Let me calculate: 11.46 kJ / 4.184 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So that's approximately 2.74 kcal. But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close to that.

Wait, but wait, I must have made a mistake here. Because when I calculated 0.2 moles reacting, each mole of H+ gives about -57.3 kJ. So 0.2 * 57.3 is 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, as the options suggest.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the enthalpy from kJ to kcal. Let me compute that. 11.46 kJ is equal to 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.737 kcal. So approximately 2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's very close. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I account for all the H+ correctly?

Wait, another approach: perhaps each mole of H+ contributes about -13.6 kcal (since 57.3 kJ ≈ 13.6 kcal because 57300 J is 57.3 kJ, and 13.6 kcal is about 56.7 kJ, which is close). So each mole of H+ gives about -13.6 kcal. 

So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72 kcal, but since it's exothermic, it's negative: -2.72 kcal. That matches option A.

But wait, why did I calculate 0.2 moles? Because OH- is 0.2 moles, which is the limiting reagent. So only 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So the answer should be A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait another thought: What about the H2SO4? Because H2SO4 is diprotic, but in the reaction with a base, does each H+ contribute the same? Hmm, I think yes. Each H+ from H2SO4 would react with an OH- ion, releasing the same amount of heat as any H+.

So, let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles → 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 OH-.

So the OH- is limiting. Thus, 0.2 H+ neutralized, which is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → approximately 2.72 kcal.

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ ions from the acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 0.5 L  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes 0.1 moles of H⁺.
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 0.3 L  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     As H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, it contributes \( 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine the moles of OH⁻ ions from the base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Molarity = 0.5 M, Volume = 0.2 L  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, it contributes \( 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which requires a 1:1 molar ratio of H⁺ to OH⁻.  
   - Total H⁺ available = 0.28 moles, Total OH⁻ available = 0.2 moles.  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it can only react with 0.2 moles of H⁺.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of H⁺ is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - Since 0.2 moles of H⁺ react, the enthalpy change is:  
     \( 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \( \frac{-11.46 \, \text{kJ}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Select the correct option:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change matches option **A) -2.72 kcal**.
