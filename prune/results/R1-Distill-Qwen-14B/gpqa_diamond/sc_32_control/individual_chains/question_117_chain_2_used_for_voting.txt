Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically regarding optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism has to do with molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. But wait, there's also something about geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. Oh right, but geometric isomerism isn't about optical activity. So to show optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or some other form of chirality.

Looking at the question, the options are four different organic compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4. The choices given are combinations of these.

Let me go through each one:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism, right? Because the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond, so they can rotate. But wait, if there are bulky groups in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring, maybe they can't rotate freely. That could lead to cis and trans isomers, which is geometric isomerism. But does that cause optical isomerism?

Wait, geometric isomerism is about the arrangement in space, but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism comes from chirality, not just geometric differences. So for this compound, the two rings are connected. Are there any chiral centers? Let's see. The central carbon where the two rings are attached is connected to two methyl groups, a nitro group, and a carboxylate? No, wait, the structure is a bit more complex. The molecule is dimethyl, so the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. Each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester.

Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two rings are connected at C1 and C1'. The substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring. So, in terms of the central structure, maybe the arrangement creates a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetric, like each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in equivalent positions, maybe the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Hmm, but wait, the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has two substituents: one in position 2, which is adjacent to the connecting bond, and another in position 6, which is across from position 2. So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other on the benzene ring. That's para positions. Wait no, in biphenyl, the numbering is such that the connecting carbon is position 1. So position 2 is adjacent, and position 6 is next to 1 on the opposite side.

Wait, perhaps each ring has two substituents: a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. That would mean each ring has two substituents in the para positions relative to each other. So for each ring, the substituents are across from each other. Now, if the substituents on each ring are both in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, could this lead to a non-symmetrical arrangement? Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of the substituents leads to a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule itself is not chiral but has a plane of symmetry, making the two isomers mirror images, which would be enantiomers and cause optical isomerism. Or perhaps not. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. If the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if on each ring, the substituents are in such a way that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So, if the nitro groups are on one side and the ester groups on another in a way that can't be mirrored, then yes, it could have optical isomers.

But I'm not entirely sure about this one. Let's move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The structure would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, wait. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, but as the ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait no, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So as the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, is there a chiral center here? The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH group,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, in this structure, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to a CH3 (from the propanoate). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's draw it:

Structure: O

       |
O=C-O-CH3

But the acid is propanoic acid, 2-hydroxy. So the structure is: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, wait. Propanoate would be three carbons: the first is the COO- group, the second is the hydroxy, and the third is the methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. The central carbon would have four substituents. Let me think of the structure as:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the one with the OH: it's CH(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so that carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? Or wait, perhaps it's CH2(OH) attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3O)OC(O)CH2CH(OH)CH3?

No, wait, propanoate is three carbons. Let me think again.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait no, the chain is CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-COOH? No, wait, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOH.

Carbon 2: CH(OH).

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let's write the structure correctly.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So as an ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is:

The three carbons are: COOCH3, CH2, CH2OH.

Wait, no, the chain is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the middle carbon is the CH2, which is attached to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2COOCH3,

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it as:

The structure is:

O
||O
O-C-O-CH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I should number the carbons. The ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3.

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH.

But as the methyl ester, it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3 is on carbon 3, CH(OH) is carbon 2, and CH3 is carbon 1.

So the central carbon is carbon 2: CH(OH).

So, the substituents on carbon 2 are:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and the other substituent is a hydrogen or another group?

Wait, no. Wait, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (carbon 3),

and the fourth substituent is another CH group? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, carbon 2 is CH(OH), which is connected to:

- carbon 1 (CH3),

- OH,

- carbon 3 (COOCH3),

and the fourth group is another CH group? No, wait. Wait, carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen? No, that can't be because that would make it CH2(OH) perhaps.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to draw it properly. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe the structure is:

Carbon chain: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, each carbon is:

Carbon 1: CH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH).

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that's three carbons. So, Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), an OH group, and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Because if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then Carbon 2 is CH(OH), which must have four bonds. So:

Carbon 2 has bonds to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),

- OH,

- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make it CH(OH) with four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, H. So that's four different groups attached to the same carbon.

Wait, that can't be. Because if the central carbon has four different substituents, it's a chiral center. So in this case, yes, the central carbon is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 does exhibit optical isomerism. 

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Phenyl)2CO. So the structure is two benzene rings attached to a carbonyl group. So, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is an aryl group. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two aryl groups. Now, can this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbon is C=O, which is double-bonded. So it can't be a chiral center because it's only attached to three groups (two phenyls and oxygen). Wait, no, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is in a ketone group. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

But wait, the carbonyl group is trigonal planar, so the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. So, each phenyl group is attached to the same carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So that carbon has three substituents: two Ph groups and the O from the double bond. Wait, but that's only three bonds. So, the central carbon must have four bonds. Oh, right, the carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, but that's only three bonds. So that can't be right. Oh wait, no, the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph, so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to oxygen. So it has two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and a lone pair? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. So, the structure is:

O
||
C connected to two Ph groups.

So, the carbonyl carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and the oxygen. But wait, that's only three bonds. So where's the fourth? Oh, wait, the carbonyl carbon has a double bond to oxygen, which is two bonds, so the substituents are two phenyl groups and a double bond. So, the central carbon has a double bond (so it's trigonal), so it can't have four different groups. So, no chiral center. Also, the molecule is symmetrical since both substituents (the two phenyl groups) are the same. Therefore, benzophenone does not have any chiral centers and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So the structure of fumarate is (E) or (Z)? Wait, fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer. So when you make the di-ester, you get the same arrangement. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's incorrect. Wait, no, fumarate is an unsaturated diacid. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. But wait, fumarate is the di-ester. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's not correct because that would be succinate. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, would be:

(CH3O)OC-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3).

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the two -COOH groups become -COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CO2CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, the structure should have double bond. So it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this right. The structure of fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that can't be. Because fumarate comes from (E)-butenedioic acid, which is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → no, wait, no, (E)-butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CO2CH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3), but that's incorrect because fumarate has a double bond. So the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3) with a double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester would be (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    CH=CH
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but that would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond. So the molecule is (E)- or (Z)-configured?

Wait, the di-ester of fumaric acid is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So the substituents on each ester group are on opposite sides of the double bond, making it the trans configuration.

Now, does this compound have any optical isomerism? Well, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some form of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

In dimethyl fumarate, let's look for chiral centers. The molecule has a central double bond (C=C). The substituents on each end are:

On each end of the double bond, there's a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group? Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH=CH-CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

COOCH3—CH2—CH2—COOCH3

But that's succinic acid diester, not fumarate. Fumarate has a double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
 \
  C=C
 /
CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me do this properly. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So when made into a di-ester, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    CH=CH
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but that's not possible. Let me think of the actual structure. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no, that can't be because the double bond is in the middle. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would be succinate, but with a double bond, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, fumarate is:

The four carbons are: COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me count: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the di-ester would be (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to CH=CH group.
 
So, the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond due to the (E) configuration.

So, does this create a chiral center? No, because the molecule itself is planar across the double bond. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the central part is a double bond, and the two substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3 groups). So the molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it cannot have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, no. Because in (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. Each side has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Hence, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the substituents on the double bond are identical, the molecule is symmetrical, so it cannot be chiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with another compound. Let me think of another example. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and maleate would be its di-ester. Fumarate is the trans isomer. If the substituents on each end are the same, like in fumarate, then the molecule is symmetrical. So for example, in (E)-fumarate, each end has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetric, and thus not chiral.

So, in this case, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) does not show optical isomerism because it's symmetrical and doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but I thought that a molecule with a double bond and identical substituents on either end would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So yes, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about if the substituents are different? Like, if the ester groups are different on each side, then maybe it could be chiral. But in this case, both substituents are COOCH3, so it's symmetrical.

So, to recap:

Option 1: I'm not sure yet. Let me think again.

Option 2: Yes, has a chiral center.

Option 3: No, symmetrical.

Option 4: No, because the substituents are the same on both sides, making it symmetrical.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine option 4. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Each end has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but arranged in the trans configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Now, back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each substituent is a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Wait, each ring has two substituents: at 2 and 6 positions, which are across from each other. So, for each ring, substituents are para to each other.

But wait, the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', which are the central positions. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are on opposite sides relative to the connecting bond.

Now, in terms of symmetry, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would not be chiral. But if the arrangement lacks such a symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, then the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate. So the substituents on each ring are on opposite positions (2 and 6), which are across the ring from each other. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, let me imagine two rings connected at their 1 positions. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, when you look from the connecting bond, the nitro is on one side, and the carboxylate is on the opposite side. So, for each ring, the substituents are para, leading to a plane of symmetry.

But wait, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral. Let's imagine looking at the molecule. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetric, leading to chirality.

Wait, another thought. The molecule could have a chiral center if the arrangement of substituents around the central bond leads to four different groups attached to a carbon. But wait, the central bond is a single bond between two carbons. So each carbon is connected to two substituents (nitro and carboxylate) and the other ring. So, each ring's central carbon is attached to two substituents and two rings.

Wait, perhaps each central carbon (on each ring) has four substituents: two from the ring, one nitro, and one carboxylate. Let me think about that. For example, the carbon at position 1 on each ring is connected to:

- The central bond (connecting to the other ring),

- The substituent at position 2 (carboxylate),

- The substituent at position 6 (nitro),

- And another hydrogen or another substituent.

Wait, perhaps each central carbon (at position 1) is connected to two substituents (the other ring, and maybe a hydrogen), but that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral. If not, then it's chiral.

But wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 2 and 6. So, each ring has the same substituents. So, the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, option 1 does not show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if you consider the mirror plane that runs through the central bond and the midpoints of the substituents, then the molecule would be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that they don't mirror each other, leading to a chiral center. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up examples. For instance, if a biphenyl has substituents in such positions that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate, at 2 and 6. So, for each ring, the substituents are para to each other, meaning that the molecule is symmetrical when viewed along the central bond.

Therefore, the molecule would be achiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of another example. If a biphenyl has substituents at positions 3 and 5 on each ring, would that lead to a chiral center? Or if the substituents are at positions that break the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's achiral. Thus, option 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

Option 1: No.

Option 2: Yes.

Option 3: No.

Option 4: No.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought option 4 didn't have optical isomerism. So the only option that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

Looking back at the question, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → No, because 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

B) 3 and 4 → Both don't, so no.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 doesn't, only 2, so no.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 doesn't, so no.

Wait, this can't be right because the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct.

Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: the structure is (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, in the trans configuration.

But wait, the substituents are all the same on each end, so it's symmetrical. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the only one that has optical isomerism is option 2.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → No.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → Only 2 is correct, so no.

D) 1 and 2 → Only 2 is correct, so no.

Wait, but none of the options have only 2. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4.

B) 3 and 4.

C) 2 and 3.

D) 1 and 2.

Hmm, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated option 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, maybe the substituents on each end are not the same, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, no, in option 4, it's dimethyl fumarate, which is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which when esterified gives (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Now, in the case of (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are the same, like two COOCH3 groups, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, no chiral center.

But wait, another thought: Could the molecule have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion, making it achiral.

Wait, another approach: Check if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's achiral. If not, it's chiral.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical because each end is identical. So, it has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, making it achiral.

Therefore, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But the given options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the question's options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4 → No.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No, because 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → Only 2 is correct, so D would be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in option 2. Let me think again.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another substituent. Wait, wait, what's the fourth substituent? If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen?

Wait, that would make four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups, meaning a chiral center. So yes, option 2 has optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is 2.

But looking at the options given:

A) 1, 2, 4.

B) 3,4.

C) 2,3.

D)1,2.

So, none of the options select only 2. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake with option 1.

Wait, perhaps option 1 does have a chiral center.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So, each ring's substituents are at opposite ends. Now, the central carbon (position 1) is connected to two rings and two substituents? Or perhaps each ring's position 1 is connected to the other ring and two substituents.

Wait, perhaps each ring's position 1 is attached to the substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, the central position (1) on each ring has:

- The other ring,

- Substituent at 2 (carboxylate),

- Substituent at 6 (nitro),

- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, if that's the case, then the central carbon on each ring would have four different substituents: the other ring (which is a phenyl group), the carboxylate, the nitro, and a hydrogen. That would make it a chiral center.

Wait, but wait, the substituents at 2 and 6 are on the same ring, so the central carbon (position 1) is connected to:

- The other ring,

- The substituent at 2 (carboxylate),

- The substituent at 6 (nitro),

- And a hydrogen.

But wait, the substituent at 2 is on the same ring as position 1. So, is the substituent at 2 attached to position 1?

Wait, no. In biphenyl, each ring is connected at position 1 and 1'. So, the substituents at positions 2 and 6 are on the same ring but not on position 1.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, but the central position (1) has only the other ring attached and maybe a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon has four substituents: the two rings (but that's the same as one substituent), two substituents (carboxylate and nitro), and a hydrogen. No, that can't be because the other ring is attached to position 1.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon (position 1) is part of the biphenyl and is connected to:

- The other ring,

- A substituent at position 2 (carboxylate),

- A substituent at position 6 (nitro),

- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four substituents, all different. So, a chiral center.

Wait, but this depends on the structure. If the substituents at 2 and 6 are on the same ring, then the central carbon (position 1) would have:

- The other ring,

- The substituent at 2,

- The substituent at 6,

- And a hydrogen.

So, four different groups: ring, carboxylate, nitro, H. That would make it a chiral center. Therefore, option 1 would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then options 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2, and 4 → No, because 4 doesn't.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No.

D) 1 and 2 → Yes.

So, the correct answer would be D) 1 and 2.

But wait, earlier I thought that option 1's substituents were arranged symmetrically, making it achiral. But if the substituents are in such a way that the central carbon is a chiral center, then option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, it's a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize it again.

In option 1, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, relative to the central bond, the substituents are on opposite sides. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents around the central bond are arranged asymmetrically.

Wait, no. Because both rings are identical in substituents, the molecule might be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a chiral center.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. I'll conclude that option 1 has a chiral center, so options 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, making the correct answer D.

To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. The central carbon (position 1 on each ring) is bonded to:  
- The other benzene ring,  
- A nitro group,  
- A carboxylate group,  
- A hydrogen.  

Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (position 2) is bonded to:  
- A methyl group (CH₃),  
- A hydroxyl group (OH),  
- An ester group (COOCH₃),  
- A hydrogen.  

This carbon is a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Since all substituents are not different, there is no chiral center, and the molecule does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, with the structure (CH₃O)₂C-CH=CH-C(=O)-OCH₃. The molecule has a double bond in the (E)-configuration, with identical substituents (COOCH₃ groups) on either side. Due to symmetry, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
- **Option 1** exhibits optical isomerism due to a chiral center.  
- **Option 2** exhibits optical isomerism due to a chiral center.  
- **Option 3** does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
- **Option 4** does not exhibit optical isomerism.  

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.
