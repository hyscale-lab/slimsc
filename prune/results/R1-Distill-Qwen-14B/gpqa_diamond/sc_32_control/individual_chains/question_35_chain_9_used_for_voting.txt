Alright, I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Okay, let's see what the question is about. So, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay, which is given as c·S. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are represented by matrices, and their eigenvalues are important properties.

So, the setup is that Ay is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), right? And the matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So, let me write that out. Matrix S would look like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, because the first row is (0 -i) and the second is (i 0). So yes, that's correct.

Now, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S. So, substituting c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The question is a multiple-choice about which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me recall that the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

So, let's construct the matrix Ay - λI. 

Ay is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

So, subtracting λ from the diagonals:

[ (-λ), (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i , (-λ) ]

The determinant of this matrix would be (-λ)(-λ) - [ (h/(4π))^2 (-i)(i) ) ]

Wait, because determinant of a 2x2 [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc.

So, ad is (-λ)(-λ) = λ². bc is [ (h/(4π))*(-i) ] * [ (h/(4π))*i ].

Wait, let's calculate bc. So, (h/(4π))² * (-i)*(i). What's (-i)(i)? Well, i * i is -1, so (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So bc is (h²/(16π²)) * 1.

Wait, that's bc = (h²/(16 π²)) * 1. So the determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)).

Set this equal to zero: λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). But wait, those are the eigenvalues for Ay. Because c is h/(4π), and the eigenvalues for S would be ±1/2. Because S is the spin-1/2 operator. Wait, because S is a Pauli matrix, right?

Wait, S is (in terms of the Pauli matrices), but the Pauli matrices usually have 2x2 matrices with 0 and i and so on. Let me think. The given S matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, that's actually the same as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by -i. Because the Pauli Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. So if S is the Pauli Y matrix, then its eigenvalues are ±1. But our matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y, so yes, its eigenvalues are ±1.

So, the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Then, since Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by those, so c*1 and c*(-1). So that's ± c = ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, so the eigenvalues for Ay are ± h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are +2πh or –2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). That can't be right because our eigenvalues are purely real, so the imaginary parts are zero.

Wait, actually, wait, let me check. No, because when I calculated the determinant, I had λ² - [h²/(16 π²)] =0. So eigenvalues are λ = ± h/(4π). So they are real numbers, no imaginary parts.

So looking at the options, which ones have real eigenvalues? Let me look:

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real ±1. So that's not the case here.

Option C and D are about eigenvectors and whether they are eigenfunctions of other operators. 

Wait, but let me think again. The matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix. Let me think about its eigenvalues. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when I multiply by a scalar c, the eigenvalues become ±c. So in our case, c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). So they are real numbers, no imaginary parts. So any option that mentions non-zero imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh. That can't be right because our eigenvalues are real.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Also wrong.

Options C and D are about the eigenvectors.

So, the correct eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π), so which option says that? Let me check the options again.

Looking back, none of the options A or B correctly state that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, Option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I think the eigenvectors form a basis, but the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't about the eigenvalues but about the eigenvectors. Since I have to pick from the options, let's look at each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. 

Wait, A is the angular momentum here. Since it's a component of angular momentum, A² would be the square of the angular momentum, which is (h²) (because for spin-1/2, A² = (s(s+1))ħ², but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, in this case, the operator Ay is the Y component of the angular momentum. The square of the angular momentum operator A² would be (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²). But wait, the operator Ay is c·S, as given. But S is a 2x2 matrix, so it's spin-1/2. So A² would be (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²) = ( (c S_x)^2 + (c S_y)^2 + (c S_z)^2 ) = c² (S_x² + S_y² + S_z² ). 

The square of the spin matrices for spin-1/2 is S² = (S_x² + S_y² + S_z²) = (3/4) ħ² I, but wait, because for spin s, S² = s(s+1) ħ² I. For s=1/2, that's (1/2)(3/2) ħ² I = (3/4) ħ² I. But here, c is h/(4π), and ħ is h/(2π). So c = h/(4π) = (ħ)/2. So c² is (ħ²)/4.

So, A² = c² (3/4 ħ² I) = (ħ²/4) * (3/4 ħ²) I? Wait, that doesn’t seem right. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, S² = ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ² I = (3/4) ħ² I. So S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2 = (3/4) ħ² I. So A² = (c S)^2? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because A_x = c S_x, A_y = c S_y, etc. So A² is A_x² + A_y² + A_z² = c² (S_x² + S_y² + S_z² ) = c² ( (3/4) ħ² ) I.

So, the eigenvalues of A² are c² (3/4) ħ². Which is (h/(4π))² * (3/4) (h/(2π))² )? Wait, no. Let me compute properly.

Wait, c is h/(4π) = ( ħ ) / 2, since ħ is h/(2π). So c = ħ/2. So c² = ħ²/4.

So, A² = c² (3/4) ħ² I. So substituting c²:

A² = ( ħ²/4 ) * (3/4 ħ² ) I ?

Wait, that seems off. Let me re-express.

Wait, S² = (s(s+1)) ħ² I, where s=1/2. So S² = (1/2)(3/2) ħ² I = (3/4) ħ² I.

Then, A² = (c S)^2 = c² S².

Wait no, A_x = c S_x, A_y = c S_y, etc. So A² = (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2 = c² (S_x² + S_y² + S_z²) = c² S².

So A² = c² S² = c² (3/4) ħ² I.

But c is h/(4π) = ħ/(2). So c² is ( ħ² ) /4. Therefore, A² = ( ħ² /4 ) * (3/4 ħ² ) I = (3 ħ^4 )/(16) I. Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally because A² should have units of (h^2), I think.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, A² = (c S)^2? No, no, because A is the angular momentum component. Wait, wait, the operator A is the total angular momentum. So, for a spin-1/2 particle, the square of the total angular momentum is A² = (ħ (s(s+1))) I. So s=1/2, so A² = ( ħ (1/2)(3/2) ) I = (3 ħ² /4) I.

But wait, in this problem, the operator is Ay, which is the Y-component. So each component is Ay = c S, where c is h/(4π). So, considering that S is the Pauli matrix, which would correspond to spin-1/2, then the total angular momentum operator A would be sqrt(A_x² + A_y² + A_z²) = sqrt( (c S_x)^2 + (c S_y)^2 + (c S_z)^2 ) = c sqrt( S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2 ) = c * sqrt( (3/4) ħ^2 ) I.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. For a spin-1/2 particle, the total spin is S = (1/2) ħ. So S² = (3/4) ħ² I. Then, each component S_x, S_y, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in our problem, Ay is c·S, which is (h/(4π)) * S. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c times the eigenvalues of S. Since S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 (because S is the Pauli matrix scaled by ħ/2, perhaps?), wait no. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when you multiply by ħ/2, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in our problem, Ay is c·S, where c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) / 2 = ħ/2. So, Ay = (ħ/2) * S. So, the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. Since S (the Pauli Y matrix) has eigenvalues ±1, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± (ħ/2) = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are the same as those of S, because it's just a scalar multiple.

Wait, so now back to the options. Let's look again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. 

Hmm. Because A² is the square of the total angular momentum, which commutes with each component. Wait, no, A² commutes with each component, so if a function is an eigenfunction of Ay, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². Because [A², A_y] = 0. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². So Option C says the opposite, that φ cannot be an eigenfunction of Az. Alternatively, maybe the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, but I thought they are not in the same eigenspace. Wait, perhaps if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az because they don't commute. But it is an eigenstate of A².

Wait, angular momentum components don't commute with each other, so a state can't be an eigenstate of two different components simultaneously. So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az unless the eigenvalue is the same. But for spin-1/2, the eigenvalues for different components are different. So, the statement in Option C says that the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not Az. That would be correct because A² commutes with Ay, so φ is an eigenstate of A², but not of Az. So Option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. I'm not sure what this means. The eigenvectors of Ay would form a basis for the space, but all eigenvectors do that. So perhaps this statement is trivially true, but I don't know if that's the correct consideration.

So, going back to the question. Which statement is correct?

The eigenvalues being real (±h/(4π)) rules out options A and B, which have imaginary parts. So the correct answer must be between options C and D.

Option C says eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That seems correct because A² commutes with Ay, so if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². But it can't be an eigenstate of Az because the components don't commute. So the statement in C is correct.

Alternatively, looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, that's correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So the correct statement is option C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) becomes:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 
-\lambda & -\frac{h}{4\pi}i \\ 
\frac{h}{4\pi}i & -\lambda 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2.
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives:

\[
\lambda^2 = \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers with no imaginary parts.

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
- **Option A**: This states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, with no imaginary parts.

- **Option B**: This states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).

- **Option C**: This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the total angular momentum operator), but not of \( A_z \) (the \( Z \)-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

- **Option D**: This states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While this statement is true in a trivial sense (eigenvectors form a basis for the space), it does not provide any meaningful insight into the problem.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
