Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Let me think.

Okay, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, right? So the molecule must have a chiral center. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pentene chain has five carbons, and the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the numbering. Oh wait, maybe I should count the carbons again. Let's see, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the middle of the chain. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me number the carbons. Carbon 1 is the first carbon with the double bond. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So yes, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have the double bond between C1 and C2, then a CH group (C3) with a methyl group, then two more CH2s. Hmm, but wait, that would make the molecule CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is at the end.

Now, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis typically breaks and reforms double bonds, swapping the ends. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually Rh or Ru based, for olefin metathesis.

So when Grubbs is used on an alkene, it can cause ring-closing metathesis if there's a diene or something, but in this case, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a monoene. Wait, but wait, are there any possibilities for cross metathesis or ring-closing? Or maybe it's a ring-opening if the molecule is cyclic, but this isn't cyclic. Wait, so maybe it's a ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, but the molecule is a straight chain.

Wait, another thought: Grubbs can cause the alkene to undergo a ring-closing metathesis if the molecule is long enough. Let's see, 3-methylpent-1-ene has five carbons. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's actually a five-carbon chain with a double bond at the first position and a methyl branch on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible metathesis products. The reaction could be a ring closure, but let's see: how many carbons are needed for a ring. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Counting the carbons, perhaps I can form a ring by connecting the ends.

Wait, but in a ring-closing metathesis, you need two alkenes. Since this is a mono-alkene, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the reaction will cause a shift in the double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the alkene could undergo a shift, like a hydride shift, but under metathesis conditions, perhaps it's more about breaking and reforming the double bonds.

Wait, maybe the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkene to undergo a process where the double bond shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-forming metathesis if the chain is long enough. Let me think: the current molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the chain is five carbons long. If I can connect the two ends, maybe the ends of the molecule can form a ring.

Wait, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. To form a ring, the double bond would need to break, and the ends would connect. Let me imagine that the catalyst would cause the two ends to swap partners. So, breaking the double bond and forming new bonds. So for a ring-closing metathesis, you'd typically need two alkenes, but in this case, there's only one. Hmm, maybe the molecule can't form a ring. Then what else could happen?

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring because it's too short. So maybe the metathesis would just result in the same molecule. That can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the double bond can move, leading to alternative alkenes.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst is usually used for olefin metathesis, which can include ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis. In this case, the molecule is a monoene, so cross metathesis isn't possible unless there's another alkene present, which there isn't. So perhaps ring-closing is possible if the molecule can form a ring.

Let me count the positions. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the chain is five carbons, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. If I try to form a ring, I'd need to connect C5 to C1, but that would require a four-membered ring (since the distance is four bonds apart). Whether that's possible depends on the catalyst. Grubbs can form small rings, but maybe five-membered rings are more favorable. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can shift to form a different structure.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs catalyst is applied to a simple mono-alkene, sometimes it can cause the double bond to shift, especially if there are substituents that make the shift favorable. For example, moving the double bond to a more substituted position, which is more stable.

In this case, the starting double bond is between C1 and C2. The adjacent carbons have CH2 and CH groups. If the double bond shifts, where would it go? Let me think: the only possible shift in this molecule would be between C2 and C3, but that's moving the double bond from the end to a more internal position.

Wait, if the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, and the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, what would that look like? It would become CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that can't be right because the double bond would have to move. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the metathesis could break the double bond and form a new one elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. Since the starting material is a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would react the same way, I think. So the product would not depend on the configuration, but on the structure.

Wait, the question is asking how many possible products are there, excluding ethene. So ethene is a byproduct, but we're not counting that. So what else can form?

If the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis, perhaps forming cyclopropane or another small ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms different alkenes by breaking and reforming the double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkene to undergo a shift, leading to a more substituted double bond. So the starting alkene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The possible shift would be to form CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the double bond can break and re-form in a different position. Let's imagine that the catalyst breaks the double bond between C1 and C2, then reforms a new double bond between C2 and C3. So the molecule would become CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that can't be right because that would require moving the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can shift to form a more substituted position.

Wait, another thought: in metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bonds and swaps the ends. So for a simple mono-alkene, perhaps the only possible product is the same molecule, but that doesn't seem right because the question is expecting multiple products.

Hmm, maybe the molecule can undergo a cross metathesis with another molecule, but since it's a racemic mixture, perhaps each molecule can exchange ends. Wait, but in a racemic mixture, each molecule is either R or S configuration. But in this molecule, the double bond is at the end, so maybe the catalyst would cause the molecule to form a ring by connecting the ends, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic product. Let me think about the possible rings. The chain is five carbons long. If the double bond is at the end, maybe connecting C5 to C1 would form a five-membered ring? Wait, that would require the double bond to be between C5 and C1, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the chain can form a ring by connecting C2 and C5, but that would create a four-membered ring, which is possible but less favorable.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form cyclopentane or something similar. But I'm not sure. Let me think: metathesis forms new double bonds. So the product would have a new double bond in a ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause the molecule to undergo a shift, leading to different possible products based on where the double bond reforms.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible diastereomers or enantiomers that could form. But wait, the starting material is racemic, so the product would also form in a certain way.

Wait, maybe the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkene to shift and form a more substituted double bond. The starting structure has the double bond between C1 and C2, which is a less substituted position (it's a terminal double bond). If the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, it would become a more substituted double bond (since C2 would be connected to two CH2 groups and a CH(CH3)).

Wait, let me count the substituents. The original double bond is between C1 and C2: C1 is CH2, and C2 is CH. So it's a less substituted double bond. If the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, then C2 would be connected to C1 (CH2), C3 (CH(CH3)), and perhaps another substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclic product. Let's imagine that the two ends of the molecule connect, forming a ring. For example, the catalyst could break the double bond and form new bonds between C1 and C5, and C2 and C4, closing the ring. That would form a cyclopentene structure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible products. The question says to exclude ethene, so ethene isn't counted as a product. So the possible products would be the other alkenes or rings formed.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause a shift of the double bond, leading to different alkenes. Let me see: the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The possible shift could be to form a double bond between C2 and C3, perhaps. Let me structure that: CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't make sense because that would eliminate a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, making it CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the Grubbs catalyst could cause the molecule to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, forming a cyclopentene derivative. For example, the double bond could shift to form a five-membered ring. So the product would be a cyclic alkene.

Wait, the original molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. If I form a ring by connecting the ends, the length of the chain would need to allow for that. Let me count the atoms between the double bond ends. From C1 to C5, there are four single bonds. So, if the double bond breaks at C1 and C2, and then forms a new double bond between C1 and C5, that would create a five-membered ring (since the ring would have five members: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5).

But wait, the ring would have a double bond in it, so it would be cyclopentene. But where would the substituents be? The starting molecule has a methyl group on C3. So in the ring, that would become a substituent on the cyclopentene ring.

Wait, but if the ring is formed, the substituent would be on one of the ring carbons. So the product would be 3-methylcyclopentene or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, leading to different products. For example, the catalyst could form the ring by connecting C1 to C3 or C2 to C4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products in terms of structure. Let me imagine the molecule:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the metathesis occurs, the catalyst could break the double bond and cause the ends to swap. So, the two ends (CH2- and -CH3) could swap. Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond breaks, and the two parts exchange partners, leading to new alkenes.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs is used on an alkene, it can cause the alkene to undergo ring-closing metathesis if the chain is long enough. In this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is five carbons. The chain from the double bond to the end is four carbons. So, perhaps it's possible to form a five-membered ring, which is favorable.

So, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative. The substituents would depend on where the ring forms. Since the starting molecule has a methyl group on the third carbon, the ring would have that methyl group attached.

Wait, but how many different products can form from this reaction? The starting material is racemic, but the product formation might not depend on the configuration because the catalyst is the same for both enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps the possible products include different isomers. Let me think: the ring could form in such a way that the methyl group is either on one side or another, leading to cis or trans isomers. Or maybe the ring forms in different positions, leading to different ring sizes. But in this case, the ring size is fixed because the chain is five carbons.

Hmm, maybe the ring-closing metathesis would lead to a single product. But wait, the molecule has a chiral center (C3) which is part of the ring. So when the ring forms, the substituents could be arranged in different ways, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, but wait: when the ring forms via metathesis, does the configuration of the original chiral center affect the product? Or does the metathesis process create new stereocenters?

Alternatively, perhaps the process is stereospecific but not stereoselective in a way that would create multiple products. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause the molecule to undergo a shift in the double bond, leading to different possible alkenes. For example, the double bond could move to between C2 and C3, creating a more substituted double bond.

In that case, the product would be 2-methylpent-2-ene or something similar. Wait, no, let's think again.

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not an alkene anymore. So maybe the shift requires the formation of a new double bond in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst breaks the original double bond and forms a new one, leading to different possible structures. Let me think: the original structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. After metathesis, the double bond could form between C2 and C3, resulting in CH2-CH=CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's 3-methylpent-2-ene. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible products:

1. No reaction: but unlikely since Grubbs catalyst is active.

2. Formation of a ring (e.g., cyclopentene derivative).

3. Shift of the double bond to a new position.

But if the shift is possible, how many different alkenes can form?

In the starting molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2 (CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3). Possible shifts could be to between C2 and C3, making CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no, because the metathesis would break the double bond and form a new one elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the double bond could shift to between C3 and C4. But in the starting molecule, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2. So the structure would look like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's just pentane, which doesn't have a double bond. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can shift in a way that a more substituted position is formed, leading to a more stable product.

Wait, maybe the metathesis leads to the formation of a more substituted double bond. So in the starting molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2, which is a less substituted position. The more substituted position would be between C2 and C3. So after metathesis, the double bond could be between C2 and C3, making a more substituted double bond.

If that happens, the product would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should think about the possible alkenes that can form.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can lead to the formation of two different alkenes, depending on where the catalyst breaks and re-forms the bonds.

Wait, another approach: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let's imagine the Grubbs catalyst breaking the double bond and the molecule undergoing a ring-closing metathesis. So, the catalyst would break the double bond and form new bonds between the ends. Let's say C1 bonds with C5 and C2 bonds with C4, forming a ring. That would give a cyclopentene derivative.

In this case, the structure would be a five-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents would be a methyl group on the ring. So the product would be 3-methylcyclopent-1-ene, perhaps.

Wait, but how many stereoisomers would that product have?

In the cyclopentene ring, the substituents could be cis or trans with respect to the double bond. Or perhaps the ring could have different substituents based on where the methyl group is attached.

Wait, but the starting molecule's methyl group is on C3. So in the ring, that would be on one of the ring carbons. Let's say in the ring, the substituent would be on a specific position, leading to a certain structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring could form in two different ways, leading to two different products. For example, the ring could form such that the methyl group is on a specific position, leading to a cis or trans isomer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring forms in a way that creates two different diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps the ring-closing metathesis leads to two possible products, depending on the geometry of the new double bond. So the product could be cis or trans, leading to two different products.

But wait, the starting material is racemic, so maybe each enantiomer would form a certain product, but I'm getting a bit lost here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to more than one product because the double bond could form in different positions.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule could undergo a cross metathesis with another molecule, but since it's a racemic mixture of the same compound, perhaps this isn't applicable here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options. The options are 2,4,6,8, etc. The question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the double bond to shift to a more substituted position, but I'm not sure how many different products that would lead to.

Wait, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. After metathesis, perhaps the possible products are:

1. The same molecule (unlikely, as that's the starting material).

2. A more substituted alkene, such as 2-methylpent-2-ene.

3. A ring-closed product, like a cyclopentene derivative.

But wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a product and another product if there's an alternative way to form the ring.

Wait, another thought: the molecule could form either a cis or trans ring product. So that would be two different products.

But earlier I thought maybe there's only one possible ring product. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible diastereomers. If the ring forms, the substituents could be on either side of the double bond, leading to cis and trans products. So that would be two products.

Plus, any possible alkenes formed by double bond shifts.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different alkenes. Let's say the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, giving one product, and perhaps another shift leading to another product. But I'm not sure if both are possible.

Alternatively, the molecule could undergo a hydride shift during the metathesis, leading to different products.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible structures the molecule can form.

Another approach: when Grubbs is used on an internal alkene, it can cause ring-closing to form a cyclic product, but for terminal alkenes, perhaps it can't form a ring. Wait, but in this case, the double bond is terminal.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst can't cause ring-closing in this case because the molecule is too short. So the only possibility is a shift in the double bond.

But then, how many possible products would that lead to?

If the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, that would give one product. If it's possible to shift to a different position, that would give another product. But in this case, I don't think the double bond can shift further because the chain is only five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the double bond can't shift beyond C3 because of the structure. So maybe only one product from the shift, plus the possibility of a ring product.

Wait, but without knowing the specifics, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could undergo a ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclopentene derivative, which would be one product, and a shift leading to another product, making two products. Plus, considering the possibility of different configurations, perhaps more.

Alternatively, considering the starting material is racemic, perhaps each enantiomer forms the same product, so the number of products doesn't increase based on the starting configuration.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 2 products. So option D is 2.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the problem is about racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene treated with Grubbs. What would Grubbs do? Grubbs causes olefin metathesis. Since the starting material is a terminal mono-alkene, perhaps the only possibility is a ring-closing metathesis. But can a terminal mono-alkene undergo ring-closing?

Wait, I think that for a ring-closing metathesis, the molecule must have two alkenes, but in this case, it's only one. So perhaps the molecule can't form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can rearrange the double bond to form a new structure. For example, breaking the double bond and forming a new one in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause the double bond to shift from between C1 and C2 to between C2 and C3. So the product would be 3-methylpent-2-ene. But wait, that's a more substituted double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could form a five-membered ring via ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclopentene derivative.

So, how many possible products are there?

If the shift is possible, that's one product. If the ring-closing is possible, that's another product. So two products.

But wait, the question says "excluding ethene." So if the metathesis produces ethene as a byproduct, we don't count that, but the other products are counted.

So, if the molecule can form both a shifted alkene and a ring product, that would be two products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the only product is the ring-closing product, which is one product.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice, and the options include 2,4,6,8, etc.

Another possibility: the Grubbs catalyst causes the alkene to undergo a cross metathesis, but since there's no other alkene available, that's not possible. So the only possible reaction is ring-closing metathesis.

But wait, the starting molecule is a mono-alkene, so ring-closing isn't possible. Wait, no, I think some ring-closing can occur with mono-alkenes if the chain is long enough.

Wait, but in this case, the chain is five carbons, which would allow a five-membered ring to form. So, the product would be a cyclopentene derivative.

But how many structural isomers are possible? The ring has five members with one double bond and a methyl substituent.

The substituent (methyl) can be in different positions relative to the double bond. For a five-membered ring, the substituent can be either on the same side (cis) or opposite side (trans) of the double bond.

Wait, but in a cyclopentene ring, the substituent would be on one of the adjacent carbons. So, perhaps there are two possible diastereomers: cis and trans.

But wait, for a cyclopentene, the double bond is fixed, and the substituent's position might not lead to cis or trans isomers because of the ring's rigidity.

Hmm, maybe the ring product is a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can occur in two different ways, leading to two different products.

Wait, perhaps the ring can form in two different ways, leading to two products. For example, the double bond could be between C1 and C2 in the ring or between C2 and C3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic starting material leads to multiple products, but I'm not sure how that would play into it.

Wait, another angle: the Grubbs catalyst might cause the double bond to shift to a more substituted position, leading to two possible products if the shift can occur in two different ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst can cause the molecule to form a more substituted double bond, leading to one product, and also a ring product, leading to two products in total.

But without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 4 products. But that depends on the possibility of multiple shifts and ring products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two possible diastereomers of the ring product, giving two products. Plus, any alkenes formed from shifting the double bond, which could add more products.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the options. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

If the catalyst causes the double bond to shift, and each shift leads to a different product, and the ring-closing leads to another product, how many would that be.

Alternatively, maybe the starting molecule can form four different products.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the double bond to shift in such a way that two different alkenes can form, each of which can form two diastereomers, leading to four products.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the only product is the ring-closing product, leading to two products based on the geometry (cis and trans), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is (Z) and (E) in racemic form, but wait no, wait, the molecule is racemic because of a chiral center, not a double bond. So the double bond's geometry isn't the issue here.

Wait, perhaps the starting molecule has a chiral center at C3. So, when the double bond shifts, it could lead to different products based on the configuration.

But in this case, the double bond's position is what's changing, not the configuration of the chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a similar problem or think about the general outcome of Grubbs on terminal alkenes.

Wait, I remember that Grubbs catalyst can cause terminal alkenes to undergo ring-closing metathesis, especially if the chain is long enough. So in this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which has four carbons after the double bond. So the chain is longer than a three-carbon chain, making ring-closing feasible.

So the product would be a cyclopentene derivative.

But how many different cyclopentene derivatives can form?

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

When the ring forms, the double bond becomes part of the ring. The substituent (methyl) would be attached to one of the ring carbons.

In a cyclopentene ring, the substituent can be either on the same side as the end of the double bond (cis) or on the opposite side (trans), leading to cis and trans isomers.

So that would give two products.

Additionally, if the double bond can form in two different positions in the ring, that would lead to more products.

Wait, perhaps the ring could form in two different ways, leading to two different products.

So perhaps two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring forms in only one way, leading to one product.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe the correct answer is two products, so option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. The starting material, 3-methylpent-1-ene, is a terminal mono-alkene with a chiral center at C3. Grubbs catalyst can induce ring-closing metathesis if the chain is long enough, and in this case, the five-carbon chain allows for the formation of a cyclopentene derivative. 

The reaction involves breaking the double bond and reforming it to create a five-membered ring. The methyl group at C3 becomes a substituent on the cyclopentene ring. Depending on the geometry of the double bond in the ring, two possible products can form: one where the methyl group is cis to the double bond and another where it is trans. These correspond to the cis and trans isomers of the cyclopentene derivative.

Additionally, the double bond in the starting material could theoretically shift to a more substituted position (e.g., between C2 and C3), but this would not lead to a new product since the resulting structure would still be a straight-chain alkene. Ethene, if formed as a byproduct, is excluded from the count of products.

Thus, the only significant products are the two stereoisomers of the cyclopentene derivative. 

Answer: D
