Okay, so I'm trying to solve this enthalpy of neutralization problem. Hmm, let me think. The question says we have three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and possibly some salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, typically around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases.

But wait, the concentrations and volumes are given, so I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base involved. Then, see which ones are in excess because only the limiting reagent will determine the amount of reaction.

Let me break down each component.

First, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic. So each mole gives two H+ ions. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 H+, so total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. The volume is 200 mL, so 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH^- ions, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but when mixing acid and base, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. The enthalpy change is based on how much H+ and OH- react.

So, let's sum up all the H+ available. From HCl: 0.1 mol. From H2SO4: 0.18 mol. Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

The OH- available is 0.2 mol. Now, the neutralization reaction will proceed until one of the reagents is used up. So, which is the limiting reactant here?

H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent. All 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+ to form water. The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol, but that doesn't react because there's no more OH-.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so maybe in a strong base like Ba(OH)2, it could donate both protons. So the reaction would be H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. Let me think about the stoichiometry here.

Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per formula unit. H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per formula unit. So the reaction would be 1:1 in terms of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. But wait, when you mix HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So perhaps the neutralization is between the sum of all H+ and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Alternatively, maybe the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react first. Let me think. In a solution with multiple acids and a base, the base will neutralize the strongest acids first. But since HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also strong, maybe all of them contribute their H+ to neutralize the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the total H+ and total OH- and then see which is in excess.

Wait, but HCl is a monoprotic strong acid, H2SO4 is diprotic. So HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 mol H+, total H+ is 0.28 mol. Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.2 mol OH-. So the neutralization is between 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-. So all the OH- reacts, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol, producing 0.2 mol H2O. The enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ that reacted.

Wait, but the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So if 0.2 mol H+ reacts, and the standard enthalpy is about -57 kJ/mol, then the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but the options have kcal and kJ. Oh, right, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute in kcal.

Each mole of H+ gives about 57 kJ, which is 13.63 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4184 J, 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.63 kcal). So if 0.2 mol reacts, then 0.2 * (-13.63) ≈ -2.726 kcal. Wait, that would be around -2.73 kcal, which is option A. But wait, that can't be right because 0.2 mol would be 13.63 *0.2= 2.726, so -2.726 kcal, which is option A: -2.72 kcal. But wait, that doesn't seem right because typically, neutralization is more exothermic when more moles react.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because for each mole of H+ that reacts, it's -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ, which is option D: -16.0 kJ? No, D is -16 kJ, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider the H2SO4 as a diprotic acid. So perhaps the Ba(OH)2 can react with both H+ from H2SO4 and HCl.

Wait, the reaction with Ba(OH)2 is with the H+ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 will neutralize 2 moles of H+ (since it provides 2 OH-). So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 can neutralize 0.2 mol H+.

Wait, but the total H+ is 0.28 mol. So 0.2 mol H+ is neutralized by Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol. Each H+ gives a certain enthalpy. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ, which is not matching. Oh, wait, maybe because the H2SO4 is diprotic, and the neutralization with Ba(OH)2 produces more than just H2O, but also a salt, which might have a different enthalpy?

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, which is about the reaction of acid and base to produce water. So perhaps the heat is only from the H+ and OH- reacting, regardless of the specific acid or base beyond their H+ and OH- contributions.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the minimum.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol. So the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH- reacting, producing 0.2 mol H2O. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ doesn't react.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the strong acid and strong base. Let me think about the stoichiometry again.

Wait, wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of acid or base. For a monoprotic acid and a monoprotic base, it's -57 kJ per mole. But in this case, the base is Ba(OH)2, which is diprotic, so each mole provides 2 OH-.

Wait, maybe the neutralization here is 1 mole of H2SO4 reacting with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, producing 2 moles of H2O.

Let me compute the moles again. H2SO4 is 0.09 mol. Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. So since H2SO4 is 0.09 and Ba(OH)2 is 0.1, H2SO4 is the limiting reagent. Wait, no. Because each H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-. So the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1:1. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 unreacted.

Wait, but I also have HCl in the solution. HCl is 0.1 mol H+.

So maybe after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, there's still H+ from HCl and possibly excess OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me think step by step.

First, let's compute the moles of each:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. Total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the OH- will react with H+ until either runs out.

0.2 mol OH- can neutralize 0.2 mol H+. So after reaction:

H+ left: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

OH- left: 0.

So the reaction is between 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

Each mole of H+ reacting contributes -57 kJ. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option D is -16 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.726 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726). So that would be around -2.726 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the neutralization of 0.2 mol H+ should be more than that. Or maybe I'm mixing up units. Let me confirm.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+. So 0.2 mol would be -11.4 kJ, which is -11,400 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184 J/kcal.

-11400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ -2.726 kcal. So that's approximately -2.73 kcal, which would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, I'm confused because the H+ from H2SO4 and HCl are both being used. But in the calculation, we accounted for all H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, and not considering HCl. Let me think again.

But no, because the HCl is a strong acid and will donate H+ as well. So all the H+ from all acids should be considered.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is whether the H2SO4 is acting as a diprotic acid or if only one H+ is involved. No, in strong acid conditions, both H+ ions are released.

So, the conclusion is that 0.2 mol H+ reacts, releasing 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's negative. So -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization as per mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reacting. Let me compute that.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4 = 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is limiting, as 0.09 < 0.1. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2. For each mole, how much enthalpy is released?

The enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 with a strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per mole, so per mole of H2SO4, it would be -57 * 2 = -114 kJ.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when H2SO4 reacts with a base, both H+ ions are neutralized. So each mole of H2SO4 would lead to 2 moles of H+ reacting, hence 2 * (-57) = -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

So if 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts, then the enthalpy would be 0.09 * (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

The remaining Ba(OH)2 after reaction with H2SO4: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.02 mol OH-.

So now, the H+ from HCl (0.1 mol) reacts with the remaining OH- (0.02 mol). So 0.02 mol H+ reacts, releasing 0.02 * (-57) = -1.14 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is -10.26 -1.14 = -11.4 kJ.

Again, that's -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.726 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726). So -2.726 kcal is about option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Which would be if I miscalculated the units.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ but the options are in kcal.

Wait, the options have two units: kcal and kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is in kJ. But none of the options match -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the neutralization isn't just between H+ and OH-, but also considering the salts formed. Or maybe it's considering the heat from the dissolution of the hydroxide or something else. But I think the standard approach is to consider just the H+ and OH- reacting.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. Neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH- reacting. So the total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ, but none of the options have that. The closest option is D: -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me recheck.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl. Correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.09 *2=0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-. Correct.

So the initial calculations are correct. So the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, leading to -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 gives two equivalents of H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-, but then adjusting for that.

Wait, another possibility: the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base, but in this case, since H2SO4 is diprotic, perhaps the calculation is done per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ converted into kcal. Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.726 kcal. So that can't be.

Wait, wait, no: 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. So the enthalpy should be about -2.726 kcal, which is option A: -2.72 kcal.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which would be way higher. So why isn't the answer matching any options? Or perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ.

Wait, looking back at the units of the options: option D is -16.0 kJ, while option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So if the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal, then option A is the one in kcal.

But the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.2 kJ (since 48.2 kJ is 11.42 kcal). But that's way more than what we have.

I think I must have made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57,000 cal per mole, which is -57 kcal (since 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 57,000 cal = 57 kcal). So per mole of H+.

Wait, no, wait: 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal, 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.63 kcal.

Wait, so per mole of H+, the enthalpy change is -13.63 kcal.

So 0.2 mol H+ would be 0.2 * (-13.63) = -2.726 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal, option A.

That would make option A the correct answer. But earlier, I thought the calculation was for -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Hmm, but wait, let me make sure. So the reaction: 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O. The enthalpy per mole of H+ is about 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative). So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a monoprotic strong acid, so each mole contributes one H⁺.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} = 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic strong acid, so each mole contributes two H⁺.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Total moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄} = 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]

3. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, and each mole contributes two OH⁻.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Total moles of OH⁻} = 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻}.
   \]

4. **Determine limiting reagent**:  
   The total moles of H⁺ available are:  
   \[
   \text{Total H⁺} = 0.1 \, \text{mol (from HCl)} + 0.18 \, \text{mol (from H₂SO₄)} = 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺}.
   \]  
   The moles of OH⁻ available are 0.2 mol. Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only 0.2 mol of H⁺ will react.

5. **Calculate enthalpy change**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H⁺ is approximately \(-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}\). For 0.2 mol of H⁺ reacting:  
   \[
   \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   To convert to kilocalories (kcal):  
   \[
   1 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{1}{4.184} \, \text{kcal}, \quad \Delta H = \frac{-11.4}{4.184} \approx -2.726 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

6. **Match with options**:  
   The calculated enthalpy change of \(-2.726 \, \text{kcal}\) aligns closely with option A, \(-2.72 \, \text{kcal}\).

ANSWER: A
