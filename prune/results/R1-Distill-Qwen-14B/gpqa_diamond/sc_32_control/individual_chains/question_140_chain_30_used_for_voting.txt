Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and see what I can figure out.

So, the problem is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, producing a gas W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius, so maybe just a bit below room temperature. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let me break down each part.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y. What liquids react violently? Maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid. Oh wait, but Y is a liquid—could be something like water or an acid. If X is a metal, maybe reacting with an acid would produce hydrogen gas (H2) as W. Or maybe another gas.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about that. For a molecule, that would mean each atom in the molecule contributes to both protons and neutrons. So, for example, if it's H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so the molecule as a whole has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2? Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule like O2 or O3? No, O2 has 8 protons each, 8 neutrons each if it's the isotope O-16. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons total. So that fits, because 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule with two atoms. So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same number. That fits.

So if W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y produces O2. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Wait, CO2 has one C and two O's. The protons would be 6 (from C) + 16*2 (from O) = 6+32=38. Neutrons in C-12 would be 6, and O-16 each has 8. So total neutrons would be 6 + 8*2=22. So 38 protons and 22 neutrons. Not the same, so that doesn't fit. So maybe O2.

So if Y is an acid, like H2SO4, and X is a metal, like sodium or potassium. But wait, sodium reacting with H2SO4 would produce hydrogen gas? Wait, no, sodium reacting with sulfuric acid would produce Na2SO4, H2 gas, and heat. Oh, but earlier I thought W was O2. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility. If Y is water. Then X could be a metal that reacts with water violently, like potassium or sodium. For example, potassium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas (H2) and potassium hydroxide. But then H2 has two protons and two neutrons? Wait, each H has a proton and no neutrons. So two protons in H2, but zero neutrons. That doesn't fit the same number. So that's not W.

Wait, maybe W is another gas. What about CO2? No, as I thought earlier. Maybe O2? How would that happen?

Wait, another scenario. Suppose X is sodium, Y is water. Reaction: 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2↑. So H2 is the gas. But H2 has two protons and zero neutrons. Doesn't match. So maybe W isn't H2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, like HCl. If X is a metal like Mg, it reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas. Same issue as before.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else, like O2. How can that happen? Let me think: if X is a metal and Y is an acid, maybe a hot acid? Or perhaps X is a carbonate? Wait, no, because if X is a carbonate, reacting with an acid would produce CO2, but then W would be CO2, which doesn't fit.

Wait another possibility: What if Y is a liquid oxide, like concentrated sulfuric acid, and X is a metal. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is liquid CO2 or something else. Not sure. Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K (about 4°C). So what is a solid that has a melting point around 4°C? Maybe something like ice, but that's 273 K. Wait, 277 is a bit higher, 4°C is 277 K, so perhaps B is water (ice). But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, something else.

Wait, another possibility: B could be a metal oxide. For example, if G is a hydroxide, and upon heating, it decomposes into a metal oxide and water. So, say, heating Mg(OH)2 would decompose into MgO and H2O. Wait, but MgO has a melting point of around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Let me think about the melting point. B is a solid at normal conditions, and its melting point is about 4°C. What has a melting point around that? Maybe some form of water, like ice. Wait, but ice melts at 273 K (0°C), but the problem says 277 K, which is 4°C. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Or maybe B is a salt that is solid at 277 K, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe B is something like paraffin or another organic compound? Not sure.

Let me think about the other clues. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. What's a common reagent? Maybe something like NaOH, KOH, or a Grignard reagent? Or perhaps something like LiAlH4, but that's a hydride. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like Mg or Na, but more likely, given the reaction with an acid.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So if X is something like a metal, when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction. For example, if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is like acetic acid, then the product would be sodium acetate, which has O from the acid. Wait, but sodium acetate has O from both the acid and the base. Hmm, but in any case, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, if X is something like a dehydrating agent, like PCl5 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another clue: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if X is a diatomic molecule like O2, and one of the oxygens is a heavier isotope, like O-18. But that's maybe not relevant to the problem.

Wait, the product of a keto acid and substance X contains two oxygen atoms. So the product has two O atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), and X is NaOH, then the product is sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+), which has two O in the acetate ion. So that fits.

So then, X could be NaOH. Let me see if that fits the rest.

X is NaOH. Reacts with Y, which is a liquid. What would Y be? Maybe an acid, but that would produce a salt and water. But the reaction is violent, so maybe Y is something else.

Wait, another thought: X could be a strong base, like NaOH. Y could be water, but that's a liquid, and reacting NaOH with water isn't violent. Alternatively, Y could be an acid. Wait, but the reaction of NaOH with H2SO4 would produce Na2SO4, H2O, and it's a neutralization reaction, not violent.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate. So X is NaOH, Y is CO2? But CO2 is a gas, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a sulfuric acid. So NaOH reacting with H2SO4 would produce Na2SO4 and H2O. But that's a neutralization reaction, not violent. So perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, perhaps Y is a liquid that reacts exothermically with a base. For example, maybe Y is concentrated sulfuric acid, and X is a metal like sodium. Wait, but earlier I thought about that.

Wait, let me think again. X is NaOH, reacts with Y (a liquid) violently. Maybe Y is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2 or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na, reacting with a liquid like water. So the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. Here, gas W is H2. But H2 has (2 protons, 0 neutrons) → protons (2), neutrons (0). So the gas W's molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So that's not same number. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but if the gas is O2, then the number doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G. So when X and Y react, a precipitate forms. For example, if X is AgNO3 (a reagent in organic chemistry sometimes), and Y is NaCl, but Y has to be a liquid. Wait, but NaCl is a solid.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal nitrate, and Y is a solution of a salt that forms a precipitate. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl solution, but that's a liquid, but would it react violently? Not really, just forms precipitate.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution, but the problem says Y is a liquid. So, perhaps Y is a solution containing something that precipitates when X is added. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a liquid to form a precipitate. For instance, lead reacting with a solution of something. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between X and a solution of a nitrate, producing a precipitate. For example, if X is sodium iodide and Y is lead nitrate solution. But that's a possible scenario.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let's think about the other clue: The product of a keto acid and X has two atoms of oxygen. If X is LiAlH4 (a strong reducing agent), but that's not a base. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's list possible substances X that are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common ones include:

- NaOH (used in saponification, etc.)
- KOH
- LiAlH4 (a strong reducing agent)
- Grignard reagents (like Mg in diethyl ether)
- PCl5, PCl3 (used as reagents)
- H2SO4 (concentrated, but maybe not as a reagent but as a catalyst)
- NH3 (in some reactions)
- Na metal (for Birch reductions, etc.)

Wait, Grignard reagents. For example, Mg metal reacts with an ether (like diethyl ether) to form a Grignard reagent. But Grignard reagents themselves are not directly reacting with the liquid Y unless Y is an acid or something.

Wait, if X is Mg (metal), then Y could be an acid like HCl. But as before, the gas would be H2. But that doesn't fit W's condition of same protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate. Reacting with an acid would produce CO2 gas. So W would be CO2. Let's check: CO2 has 1 C and 2 O. C has 6 protons and maybe 6 neutrons (C-12), each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So total protons: 6 + 16*2= 38. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2= 22. 38 ≠ 22, so that doesn't fit the condition. So W can't be CO2.

Hmm. Maybe W is another molecule. Wait, another thought: If W is O3 (ozone), then each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. O3 would have 24 protons and 24 neutrons. So same number. That fits. So W could be O3. But how would that happen? Ozone is formed by the reaction of oxygen with something, perhaps? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe W is NH3? No, NH3 has 14 protons (N:7, H:1 each), and N has 7 neutrons (N-14), each H has 0. So total protons: 7 + 3 =10, neutrons:7. Not same.

Hmm. Maybe W is H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 8. Not same.

Wait, another possibility: W is CH4. But that has 6 protons (C:6, H:4) and 6 neutrons (C is 12, so 6 neutrons; H has 0). So 10 protons, 6 neutrons. Not same.

Hmm. Maybe W is a noble gas? Like O2, but we thought that earlier.

Wait, maybe it's another diatomic molecule. For example, Cl2. Cl has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (Cl-35). So Cl2 would have 34 protons and 36 neutrons. Not same.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule where protons and neutrons are same in the molecule. Let me think of O2 again. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. O2: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So same. So W is O2.

So if W is O2, how is it produced? Maybe Y is a solution of a peroxide, which when reacts with an acid produces O2. For example, H2O2 (peroxide) reacting with H2SO4 could produce O2 gas. But that's a possibility.

Wait, H2O2 and H2SO4:  H2O2 + H2SO4 → SO4^2- + 2 H2O + O2↑. So O2 is the gas.

So if X is H2SO4 (a reagent in organic chemistry) reacting with H2O2 (liquid Y?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal reacting with a peroxide.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal like sodium or potassium. Sodium reacts with water to produce H2, but we thought that doesn't fit. But if Y is hydrogen peroxide, then sodium reacts with H2O2. Let me think: 2 Na + 2 H2O2 → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So again, H2 is the gas. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, and Y is something else. Not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a metal oxide. For example, copper(II) oxide reacting with a strong acid. But that's probably not producing O2.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a liquid oxide, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the gas W is O2, and it's produced from the decomposition of some compound. For example, if Y is a solution containing something that decomposes upon reaction with X. So, maybe X is a strong acid, and Y is a solution of a peroxide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate solution, but then W would be CO2 again, which doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B. So G is a compound that upon heating decomposes to form B and maybe gas. For example, if G is magnesium hydroxide, and when heated, it forms magnesium oxide and water. But then B would be MgO, which has a high melting point, not around 277 K.

Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate hydroxide, like sodium carbonate decahydrate. When heated, it loses water and becomes sodium carbonate, but that doesn't produce B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. Maybe when G is heated, it leaves a metal residue. For example, G could be a basic carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the melting point of B is close to 277 K (4°C). So maybe B is a solid with a low melting point. For example, paraffin wax has a higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a salt that's solid at room temperature but melts around 4°C. Wait, sodium acetate? Or another salt?

Alternatively, maybe B is something like water ice. Wait, but ice melts at 273 K, which is just a few degrees below 277 K. If the problem states it's very close, maybe B is a different form of ice or another compound with a similar melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is another solid with a melting point around 4°C. Maybe ammonium nitrate? Wait, ammonium nitrate's melting point is around 169°C, which is much higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound altogether. Let me think again about the reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a liquid acid. Let's say X is sodium, Y is concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction would produce Na2SO4, H2S↑ (but H2S is a gas). Wait, but H2S has two protons and each S has 32 protons (wait, no, H2S has 2 H and 1 S. Sulfur has atomic number 16, so 16 protons. So H2S has 2+16=18 protons. Neutrons: S-32 has 16 neutrons. So 16 in S, plus H has 0. So total neutrons 16. So 18 protons and 16 neutrons. Not same.

Hmm. Not matching. So maybe that's not W.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something else. Let me think of another approach.

Since the problem is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, perhaps I should figure out what X is.

Substance X is a reagent in organic chemistry, possibly a base, like NaOH. But let's think about the isotopes. X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if X is NaOH, the heavier isotope could be O-18 or H-2 (deuterium). But H-2 is a lighter isotope than H-1; wait, no, heavier. So if X has a heavier isotope, perhaps one of its elements is H, and it has some deuterium (H-2) in it.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound where one of the elements has a heavier isotope, like Cl-35 vs Cl-37. For example, if X is NaCl, but that's a solid, not a liquid.

Wait, but the problem states that X is a substance, not necessarily a single element. So perhaps X is a diatomic element, like O2 or Cl2. Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, but it's a liquid when cold. Wait, no, O2 is a gas. Oh, unless at low temperatures, it's a liquid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, for the cumulative atomic masses: we're told to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all their isotopes. So for example, if X is H2O, the elements are H and O. The lightest is H (atomic mass ~1) and the heaviest is O (atomic mass ~16). So cumulative is 17. But 17 isn't one of the options, so that's probably not X.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. Let me see:

Option C is 31. That's the sum of 1 (H) and 30 (what element has atomic mass 30? Maybe Zn is ~65, so no. Wait, perhaps 30 is the atomic mass of something else. Wait, perhaps the elements are Cl and something else.

Wait, let me think: if X is Cl2, then the elements are Cl. Only one element. But the question says "lightest and heaviest", implying two elements. So X must have two elements.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid and X contains two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), then the product would be sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. So that fits.

So X is NaOH. Then, what's the reaction with Y? Y is a liquid, so maybe Y is water? No, because NaOH in water is just dissolving. Alternatively, Y could be an acid, like H2SO4, but that's a liquid. So the reaction would be NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O. But that's a neutralization, not a violent reaction. So maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, if Y is a solution containing something else. But I'm not getting much progress here.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. When NaOH reacts with an acid, it might form a salt and water, but if the acid is a solution with other ions, maybe a precipitate forms. For example, if Y is a solution of copper sulfate, then NaOH would react to form Cu(OH)2, which is a precipitate. So when heated, Cu(OH)2 would decompose into CuO and H2O. So B would be CuO. But what's the melting point of CuO? I think it's around 2300°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe G is a hydroxide of another metal. Let's think: when NaOH reacts with AlCl3, it forms Al(OH)3 precipitate. Heating Al(OH)3 would produce Al2O3 and H2O. Al2O3 has a melting point around 2050°C. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the precipitate is something else. Perhaps sodium sulfate decahydrate? No, that wouldn't precipitate; it would form a solution.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is NaOH. Then, the reaction would produce AgOH, which is a precipitate. But AgOH is unstable and decomposes into AgO and water. Wait, but I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is AgO or Ag2O. When heated, Ag2O decomposes into Ag and O2. So B would be Ag. The melting point of silver is around 961°C, which is much higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me try another angle. The product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. So if X is NaOH, the product is a sodium salt of the keto acid. For example, if the keto acid is CH3COOH (acetic acid), then the product is CH3COO^- Na^+. That has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. So that fits.

So back to the reaction: X (NaOH) reacts with Y (liquid). What reacts with NaOH to produce a precipitate? Maybe a solution containing a metal ion that forms an insoluble hydroxide. For example, FeCl3 solution would react with NaOH to form Fe(OH)3 precipitate.

So when FeCl3 solution (liquid Y) reacts with NaOH (X), it produces Fe(OH)3 (precipitate G). Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into Fe2O3 (B) and H2O. But Fe2O3 has a melting point of around 1535°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe the precipitate is sodium carbonate. No, sodium carbonate is soluble. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a sulfide? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is NaOH. Let's say Y is a solution of AgNO3. Then the reaction is NaOH + AgNO3 → AgOH → AgO (precipitate). But I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a lead nitrate. Then, NaOH would react to form lead hydroxide, which is a precipitate. Heating lead hydroxide would decompose into lead oxide and water. But the melting point of lead oxide is around 800°C, which is higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the precipitate isn't a hydroxide. Perhaps it's a carbonate. For example, if Y is a solution of CaCl2, and X is Na2CO3, then the reaction would produce CaCO3 precipitate. But X would need to be a reagent, which Na2CO3 is. But X is known for having a heavier isotope. So if X is Na2CO3, which has Cl? No, wait, Na is in X.

Wait, but in this scenario, Na2CO3 is X, and Y is CaCl2 solution. The reaction would produce CaCO3(s) and NaCl(aq). So G is CaCO3. When heated, CaCO3 decomposes into CaO and CO2. So B would be CaO. The melting point of CaO is about 2615°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So no match.

Wait, maybe the precipitate is a sulfide. But that would require Y to contain S^2- ions, which isn't likely as a liquid.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the gas W again. If W is O2, then the reaction must produce O2. How can that happen? Maybe Y is a solution containing a peroxide, and X is an acid. For example, sulfuric acid (X) reacting with hydrogen peroxide (Y). The reaction would be H2O2 + H2SO4 → SO2↑ + 2 H2O + O2↑. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid and Y is a peroxide.

Wait, if X is H2SO4 (a strong acid, reagent in organic chemistry), and Y is H2O2 (a liquid), then their reaction could produce O2 gas. So W is O2.

So the reaction would be something like H2SO4 + H2O2 → ... O2↑. Let me check the reaction: H2O2 decomposes in the presence of H2SO4 as a catalyst, but perhaps under certain conditions, it produces O2. The balanced equation is H2O2 → H2O + O2↑. But with H2SO4 as a catalyst, perhaps it's involved.

Wait, another thought: H2SO4 (concentrated) and H2O2 can react to produce O2. The reaction is: H2O2 + H2SO4 → SO2↑ + 2 H2O + O2↑. Let me balance it.

On the left: 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2 (that's the decomposition of H2O2). But when H2SO4 is involved, perhaps the products are different. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is H2O2 + H2SO4 → SO4^2- + 2 H2O + O2↑. Let me balance it.

H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2SO4 is H2SO4, and the products are H2O and O2. Wait, perhaps the reaction is H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2SO4 (maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps it's H2O2 acting as a reducing agent, and H2SO4 as oxidizing.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2↑ + SO2↑. Let me check the atoms:

H2O2: 2 H, 2 O
H2SO4: 2 H, 1 S, 4 O
Products: H2O (2 H, 1 O), O2 (2 O), SO2 (1 S, 2 O)
So total H: 2 (from H2O2) + 2 (from H2SO4) → 4 H on left. On right, H2O has 2 H, so need another 2 H somewhere. Hmm. Maybe another H2O.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2↑ + SO2↑ + H+.

Let me balance:

H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2 + SO2

Break it down:

On the left: 2 H2O2 → 4 H, 4 O.
H2SO4 → 2 H, 1 S, 4 O.

Total H: 4 + 2 = 6. O:4 +4 =8. S:1.

On the right:

H2O: 2 H, 1 O.
O2: 2 O.
SO2: 1 S, 2 O.

Total H:2, O:1+2=3, S:1.

So to balance H: left has 6, right has 2. So perhaps 3 H2O on the right.

Wait, trying another approach:

H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2 + SO2

Looking at S: 1 on each side. O: left 4 (H2O2) +4 (H2SO4) =8. On right: 1 (H2O) + 2 (O2)*2 (since O2 is O2) + 2 (SO2) = 1 +4 +2=7. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2 + S-containing product.

Wait, maybe it's H2O2 reacting with H2SO4 to produce H2O, O2, and SO4^2-.

Wait, let me write the reaction:

H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2↑ + SO4^2-

Now, balance the atoms.

H: 2 (H2O2) + 2 (H2SO4) =4 H on left.

On right: H2O has 2 H, and SO4^2- has none. So 2 H on right. Need 2 more H. Maybe another H2O.

Wait, perhaps:

H2O2 + H2SO4 → 2 H2O + O2↑ + SO4^2-

Now, balance:

H: 2 (H2O2) + 2 (H2SO4) =4 → 2*2 (H2O) =4. So H is balanced.

O: H2O2 has 2, H2SO4 has4 → total 6 O.

On the right: 2 H2O (2*1=2 O) + O2 (2 O) + SO4^2- (4 O) → 2 + 2 +4=8 O. Not balanced.

Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas W isn't O2. Maybe it's another molecule where the total protons and neutrons are the same.

Wait, I'm stuck on this point. Let me think of another possible molecule. What about N2? Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Same number. So W could be N2 gas. How would that form?

N2 is usually formed from reactions involving nitrates or other N-containing compounds. For example, decomposition of nitrates might produce N2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is another diatomic molecule like Cl2. Cl has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (Cl-35). So Cl2 would have 34 protons and 36 neutrons. Not same.

Wait, what about C2? Carbon normally has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (C-12). So C2 would have 12 protons and 12 neutrons. Same number. So W could be C2. But I don't know any common reaction that produces C2 gas.

Hmm. Maybe W is a different molecule altogether. Let me consider another approach: think about the melting point of B being near 277 K. 277 K is 4°C, so it's just above 0°C. What solid has a melting point around that? Maybe a type of ice or a specific organic compound.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of water, like ice, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that forms hydrates, and upon heating the precipitate, it loses water, leaving B as a solid with a melting point around 4°C. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a metal. For example, mercury has a melting point of -38.83°C, which is way lower. Lead melts at 327°C, which is higher. So that's not matching. Maybe another metal with a melting point near 4°C? I'm not aware of any.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer by considering the options given. Let's see, the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

We need to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (atomic number 11, atomic mass ~23), O (16), and H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which is close to option B (25), but not exact. So perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: if X is NH3, but that's a gas, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

If X is H2O, the elements are H and O. H is lightest, O is heaviest. So 1 + 16 =17, which is not an option.

If X is CH3OH (methanol), elements C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12). Sum is 13. Not an option.

If X is NaOH, as before: H (1), O (16), Na (23). Sum 1+23=24. Close to option B (25), but not matching.

Wait, another compound: if X is KClO3. Elements K (39), Cl (35.5), O (16). Lightest is Cl? No, O is lighter than Cl. Wait, no: K (39), Cl (35.5), O (16). So lightest is O (16), heaviest K (39). Sum 16+39=55. Not an option.

If X is CaCO3, elements Ca (40), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C (12), heaviest Ca (40). Sum 52. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. For example, if X is O2, but that's a gas. Or Cl2. Cl's atomic mass is about 35.5. So if X is Cl2, then only Cl is present. So lightest and heaviest are same, so sum is 35.5 +35.5=71. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the cumulative atomic masses would be 35 + 37 =72. Not an option.

Hmm. Another possibility: if X is a compound with two elements, and the lightest is H (1) and heaviest is Cl (35.5). So sum is 36.5, which is close to option A (35). But that's approximate.

Alternatively, if X has elements H and Cl, perhaps. Let me think: if X is HCl, which is a gas, but if it's a liquid under certain conditions. HCl is a gas at standard conditions, but can be a liquid at low temperatures. So perhaps X is HCl (a reagent in organic chemistry, like as a catalyst or in some reactions). Then the elements are H and Cl. Sum is 1 +35.5=36.5, which is approx 35. So option A is 35. Close enough.

But wait, the problem states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So if X is HCl, then maybe one of the H is deuterium (H-2). So in X, some H atoms are H-1 and others are H-2. But for the cumulative atomic mass, the problem says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. So if X is HCl, and suppose all H are H-1 and some are H-2, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a heavier isotope, like Cl-37 in HCl.

But wait, the problem says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes present. So for H, you have H-1 and maybe H-2. For Cl, you have Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the cumulative would be (1 +2) + (35 +37) = 3 +72=75. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a single element. For example, if X is Cl2, which is made of Cl atoms. So the lightest and heaviest isotopes are Cl-35 and Cl-37. So sum is 35 +37=72. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: if X is a metal like sodium, which has isotopes. Sodium's main isotope is Na-23. So if X is Na metal, then it's composed of Na-23 and possibly Na-24 (rare). So the lightest is Na-23 (23), and the heaviest is let's say Na-25 (25). Sum is 23+25=48. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a compound with two elements, and the elements are, say, H and Cl. Lightest element H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is close to option A (35). But the options don't have 36.5, so maybe 35 is the intended answer, possibly rounded.

So perhaps the correct answer is A)35.

Alternatively, considering the options, perhaps X is a compound where the elements are Cl and another element. For example, if X is Cl2O or something else. Let me think: Cl's atomic mass is ~35.5, O is 16. Sum would be 35.5 +16=51.5, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is a compound with elements like O and S. For example, SO2. Sulfur is about 32, O is 16. Sum is 32+16=48. Not an option.

Hmm. I think I'm not making progress. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options and what I've considered.

The options are 35,25,31,29.

Earlier, considering X as HCl gives a sum of about 36, which is close to option A (35). Alternatively, if X is NaOH, sum is 24, which is close to option B (25). But the correct answer is probably option C or D.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a compound where the lightest element is O and the heaviest is S. For example, SO3. O is 16, S is 32. Sum is 48. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where the lightest is O and heaviest is Cl. So sum 16 +35.5=51.5. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base like NaOH, the product would have two O's. So X is NaOH.

Then, the elements in NaOH are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Close to option B (25), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. But earlier, I thought X is a reagent. NH3 is a base and a reagent. So elements N (14) and H (1). Sum is 15. Not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps X is a noble gas in a heavier isotope. For example, if X is Kr (krypton), which is a noble gas. But Kr is a single element, so sum would be Kr's isotope masses. Kr has several isotopes, with the most abundant being Kr-82 and Kr-84. So sum of lightest (Kr-78?) and heaviest (Kr-86?), but I'm not sure. Kr's isotopes’ masses are around 80-86. So sum would be 78 +86=164. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule of a halogen, like Cl2. Then, the lightest isotope is Cl-35 and heaviest Cl-37. Sum 35 +37=72. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a compound where the elements are F and another element. F has an atomic mass of ~19. Suppose the other element is H (1), sum 20. Not an option.

Alternatively, the other element is O (16). Sum 19+16=35, which is option A. So if X is HF (hydrogen fluoride), which is a liquid at room temperature. HF is a weak acid and is used as a reagent. So X is HF.

Then, the elements are H and F. H is lightest (1), F is heaviest (19). Sum is 20. But that's not an option. Wait, unless the isotopes are considered.

Wait, X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So if HF has F-19 and maybe F-18, but the heavier would be F-19. So perhaps X has F-19. Then, the cumulative atomic masses would be H (1) and F (19). So sum is 20. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me think back to the problem statement.

The product of a keto acid and X contains two oxygen atoms. So if X is NaOH, the product is CH3COO^- Na^+ (sodium acetate), which has two O's. So that fits. So X is NaOH.

Then, the elements in NaOH are Na (23), O (16), H (1). So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Closest option is B)25.

But the options don't have 24. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product has two O's, but perhaps in a different arrangement. For example, if the product is a carbonate, which has three O's. But that doesn't fit. Or maybe a sulfate, which has four O's. No, the problem says two O's.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. No, because X is reacting with a keto acid.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal, and the product is a salt where the anion has two O's. For example, if X is Mg metal, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, then the product would be Mg acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion.

So, X is Mg. Then, the elements are Mg (24.3) and H (1) in the reaction with the keto acid. Wait, but Mg is a metal, so when it reacts with a keto acid, which is a carboxylic acid, it would produce Mg salt and H2 gas. So the product would be the magnesium salt, which would have two O's from the acid.

If X is Mg, the elements are Mg and H. So the cumulative atomic masses would be Mg (24.3) and H (1). Sum is 25.3, which rounds to 25. So option B is 25.

So that would fit.

Additionally, Mg is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, for example, in the Birch reduction.

So putting it all together:

X is Mg metal. It reacts with a liquid Y (maybe an acid or a solution) to produce gas W. If Y is an acid, the gas would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit. So perhaps Y is a different liquid.

Wait, earlier I thought W is O2, but that didn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces MgO and another product.

Wait, if X is Mg, and Y is H2O (liquid), then the reaction would be 2 Mg + 2 H2O → 2 Mg(OH)2 + H2↑. So W is H2. Which doesn't fit the same number of protons and neutrons.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a carbonate. Mg reacts with CO2 (gas) in water to form MgCO3. But Y would have to be a solution of something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate. Mg reacts with HNO3 to produce Mg(NO3)2, H2↑, and maybe some other products. But again, W is H2, which doesn't fit.

Wait, but if W is O2, then perhaps the reaction is between Mg and a peroxide. Mg reacts with H2O2 to produce MgO and H2O and O2 gas. Let me check the reaction:

2 Mg + 2 H2O2 → 2 MgO + H2O + O2↑.

So W is O2. Each O in O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same number. That fits.

So the reaction is Mg + H2O2 → MgO + H2O + O2↑.

So, X is Mg (heavier isotope? Mg has Mg-24, Mg-25, Mg-26. So one of the heavier isotopes is Mg-26). So X is Mg.

Then, the product of a keto acid and X is a magnesium salt, which has two oxygen atoms in the anion. For example, magnesium acetate has two O's in the acetate ion.

So the elements in X (Mg) are just Mg. Wait, but the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". Wait, X is Mg, which is a single element. So the lightest and heaviest are the same—Mg. So the sum would be Mg's lightest isotope + heaviest isotope.

Wait, but the problem states: "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." So for Mg, which has isotopes like Mg-24, Mg-25, Mg-26, the lightest is Mg-24 (24), heaviest Mg-26 (26). So sum is 24 +26=50. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is a single element, then both are same, so sum is 2 * atomic mass. But for Mg, that would be 48, not an option.

Wait, but perhaps X is a compound where the elements are Mg and another element. Wait, X is Mg, a metal. So perhaps the problem is considering the elements in the product, but no, the problem says elements present within X.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with Mg and another element. Let's think: if X is MgO, then the elements are Mg and O. Lightest is O (16), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum is 40.3, not an option.

Alternatively, X is Mg(OH)2. Elements Mg (24.3), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum is 25.3, which is about 25. Option B.

But X is a reactant in the reaction with Y, which produces G, and when heated, B.

Wait, but X as Mg(OH)2 is a solid, not a liquid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles. Based on earlier reasoning, X is Mg, and the sum is 25.3, which is option B (25). So I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W, Precipitate G, and ultimately forms B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. X is a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This suggests W could be O₂, as each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, making O₂ have 16 protons and 16 neutrons.

2. **Reaction of X with Y**: X reacts violently with Y, producing O₂. A plausible reaction is magnesium (Mg) reacting with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), as:
   \[
   2 \, \text{Mg} + 2 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{MgO} + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{O}_2 \uparrow
   \]
   Here, Mg reacts with H₂O₂ to produce MgO, H₂O, and O₂ gas.

3. **Precipitate G and B**: When MgO (precipitate G) is heated, it decomposes into Mg (B) and O₂. The melting point of Mg is approximately 922°C, which is much higher than 277 K. This discrepancy suggests alternative interpretations, but Mg remains a plausible candidate for X.

4. **Product with Keto Acid**: When Mg reacts with a keto acid (e.g., acetic acid), it forms a magnesium salt (e.g., magnesium acetate). Magnesium acetate contains two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion, consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Isotopes in X**: Magnesium has isotopes, with the lightest being Mg-24 (atomic mass ≈ 24) and the heaviest being Mg-26 (atomic mass ≈ 26). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes are:
   \[
   24 + 26 = 50
   \]
   However, if X is interpreted as a compound (e.g., MgO), the lightest element is oxygen (atomic mass ≈ 16), and the heaviest is magnesium (atomic mass ≈ 24.3). The cumulative atomic masses would then be:
   \[
   16 + 24.3 = 40.3
   \]

6. **Final Interpretation**: Given the options provided (35, 25, 31, 29), the most plausible answer aligns with interpreting X as magnesium (Mg). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Mg are approximately:
   \[
   24 + 26 = 50
   \]
   However, rounding or alternative interpretations suggest the closest match is **25**, which corresponds to the lightest (H) and heaviest (Na) elements in a compound like NaOH. Despite inconsistencies, **25** is selected as the best answer based on the reasoning.
