Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a Ca-EDTA complex, and some equilibrium constant is given. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, so that's probably relevant here.

So the problem says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, stochiometric—oh right, that means the molar ratio is 1:1 between Ca and EDTA. So Ca-EDTA is like a complex where each Ca is bound to EDTA in a 1:1 ratio.

The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA affecting the stability. That's good because EDTA can have different forms depending on pH, and that complicates things. The temperature is 25°C, which I assume is room temperature, so maybe activity coefficients are around 1 or we can ignore them. 

The given K value is K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10. Wait, what's K here? I think that's the formation constant, Kf, for the complex. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the Ca-EDTA complex. So the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So the formation constant Kf is 5e10, which is a large number, meaning the complex is very stable. That makes sense because EDTA is a strong chelating agent.

Now, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So the solution has the complex, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the equilibrium. But wait, the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M.

Let me set up the equilibrium expression. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as [Ca²+] and the concentration of EDTA^4- as [EDTA^4-]. The formation constant is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and nothing else is present, then as the complex dissociates, it produces equal amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but in solution, if the complex is 0.02 M, then when it dissociates, it produces x concentration of Ca²+ and x concentration of EDTA^4-.

So let's set up the equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 - x, but wait if the complex is in solution, and it dissociates a little. Wait, no, because the complex is the only species present—so the initial concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x, but wait no, because the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the dissociation.

Another approach: initially, all the species is the complex, so [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. As it dissociates, it forms Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, let's assume that the amount of complex that dissociates is 'x'. Then, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But wait, since Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. That means very little dissociation will occur. So x should be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

So the equation becomes:

Kf ≈ (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, solving for x: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → 2e-3 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12. So x squared is 0.4e-12 → x = sqrt(0.4e-12).

Calculating sqrt(0.4e-12): sqrt(0.4) is about 0.63246, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So x ≈ 0.63246e-6 M, which is 6.3246e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Initially, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and no free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) or \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) is present. As the complex dissociates, it produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), denoted as \(x\). Thus, at equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-14}} = 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.
