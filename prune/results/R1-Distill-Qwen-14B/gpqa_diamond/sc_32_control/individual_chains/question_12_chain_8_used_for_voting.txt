Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a pion. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that pions can decay into other particles, like in this case, a positive pion is decaying into a positive muon and a neutrino. The equation given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. And the pion is stationary, so its initial momentum must be zero. 

The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options are A to D, each giving two energies. I think I need to calculate the kinetic energies of both the muon and the neutrino after the decay.

First, I should recall some basic concepts. In particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think the muon has a rest mass of about 105.7 MeV, and the pion is 139.6 MeV. Oh, right, the rest masses are given: m_pi = 139.6 MeV, and m_mu = 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's mass is negligible, so we can treat it as massless.

So, the decay process is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let me think about the energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c². Since we're using units where c=1, E_initial is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. But the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is just its kinetic energy (since E = sqrt(p²c² + m²c^4) → p c when m=0).

Wait, but the muon has a rest mass, so its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). And the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c. Since their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, p_mu = -p_nu. So, their magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Let me denote p_mu as +p and p_nu as -p. But for magnitude, it's p.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu^2) + p. And this should equal the initial energy, which is m_pi.

So, the equation is sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, solving this equation for p. Let me set x = p to make it easier.

So, equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

I can rearrange this: sqrt(x² + 11170.49) = 139.6 - x.

Wait, 105.7 squared is 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that: 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is ~32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 105.7^2 ≈ (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 ≈ 11172.49. Hmm, close enough for approximations.

So, squaring both sides:

x² + 11172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + 11172.49 = (19488.16) - (279.2 x) + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Now, rearranging:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's see, 19488 minus 11172 is 8316. So, 8315.67 approximately.

So, 279.2 x ≈ 8315.67.

Divide both sides by 279.2:

x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 8315 by 279: 279 * 30 is 8370, which is a bit more than 8315. So maybe around 29.8?

Wait, 279 * 30 = 8370. 8315 is 55 less than 8370, so 8370-55=8315. So 30 - (55/279) ≈ 30 - 0.197 ≈ 29.803. So x ≈ 29.8 GeV? Wait no, units are MeV/c, right? Because p is in MeV/c units.

Wait, no, units probably don't matter in the calculation since we're dealing in terms of 'p' as a variable. Hmm, but the actual value of p will be in MeV/c.

So, p ≈ 29.8 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon E_mu is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let's compute that.

29.8^2 is about 888.04. 105.7^2 is about 11172.49. Adding them: 888.04 + 11172.49 ≈ 12060.53. Square root of that is sqrt(12060.53) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial energy is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's energy would be 109.8 MeV? Then the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV. Wait, 109.8 +29.8 = 139.6, which matches the initial. So that makes sense.

So the muon's energy is 109.8 MeV, which is its rest mass plus kinetic energy. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

And the neutrino's energy is p*c, which is 29.8 MeV, and since its rest mass is zero, all of that is kinetic energy.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That must be the correct answer.

Wait a minute, but wait, the neutrino's energy is 29.8, which is its KE. And the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV. So the choices are for the KE of the product particles. So option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the one.

To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = E_{\text{initial}}.
   \]  
   The muon's energy is \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\), and the neutrino's energy is \(E_{\nu} = p\), where \(p\) is the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (equal and opposite to the neutrino's momentum).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay is zero. Thus, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta, and their magnitudes are the same: \(|p_{\mu}| = |p_{\nu}| = p\).

3. **Solving for \(p\)**:  
   Substituting into the energy conservation equation:  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
   \]  
   Let \(x = p\). Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
   \]  
   Expanding and simplifying:  
   \[
   x^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)x + x^2.
   \]  
   Cancel \(x^2\) and solve for \(x\):  
   \[
   279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
   \]  
   \[
   x \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV/c}.
   \]

4. **Muon's Energy and Kinetic Energy**:  
   The muon's total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

5. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:  
   The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = p = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.1 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
