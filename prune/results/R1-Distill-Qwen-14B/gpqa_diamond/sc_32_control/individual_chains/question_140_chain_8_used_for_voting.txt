Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Hmm, the question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is about 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are.

Starting with gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, that means the molecular weight of W is even because each proton and neutron has a mass of about 1 (ignoring binding energy for now). Also, a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons—wait, that's probably something like H2O or CO2? Wait, no. Let's think about elements where the isotope is heavier. Wait, maybe W is H2 because each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. But that's not possible because H has different isotopes. Wait, W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think: maybe it's CO2? No, carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. Wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CH4? No, that's 6 protons and 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, another approach: for a molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons in the entire molecule would be equal. Wait, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, if the molecule is composed of atoms where each atom has, say, 1 proton and 1 neutron (like deuterium), but that's a gas. Or maybe a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons, like D2 (deuterium gas), but that's not a common gas. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CO2, but that's 2+16=18, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, the question says gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So maybe each molecule has a certain number of each, and the totals are the same. Let me think about possible molecules. For example, if W is CO2, then each CO2 molecule has (6 + 8) * 2 = 28 neutrons (wait, no, that's not right). Wait, no, each CO2 molecule has 6 protons in C and 8 in each O, so total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons would be? Carbon has 6 neutrons normally, and oxygen has 8 each. So each CO2 has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons, and 6 + 2*8 = 22 neutrons. Oh! So CO2 would have equal protons and neutrons in each molecule. So W might be CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas. So when substance X reacts with liquid Y, it releases CO2? Also, when heated, precipitate G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, which is close to the melting point of water (0°C) but not exactly. Wait, what substance has a melting point near that? Hmm, maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. If X is a carbonate, reacting with something to release CO2. Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate. But wait, X has a heavier isotope. So maybe it's something like sodium bicarbonate, which is NaHCO3. But if X is a heavier isotope, perhaps the element is sodium, which has isotopes like Na-23 and Na-25? Or maybe it's carbon. Wait, maybe the heavier isotope is in the carbonate.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about what Y could be. Liquid Y reacting violently with X. Common violent reactions: metals with acid, maybe. For example, if Y is an acid like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and X is a carbonate? Or maybe Y is water. If X is a carbonate, reacting with water would not be violent. Alternatively, if X is a bicarbonate, reacting with acid could release CO2. Or perhaps X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid to produce CO2 gas.

Wait, let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms, which upon heating releases B. Heating a precipitate might decompose. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating could release CO2 and leave behind another compound, perhaps a metal oxide. For example, heating sodium carbonate gives sodium oxide and CO2. Alternatively, if G is a bicarbonate, like sodium bicarbonate, heating it decomposes into sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O.

So, if G is sodium bicarbonate, then when heated, it would produce sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O. But the B in the question is the product when G is heated. So B could be sodium carbonate. But what's the melting point of sodium carbonate? Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) has a melting point of about 842°C, which is much higher than 277 K (which is ~4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is something else. The melting point being near 277 K (~4°C) suggests it's a solid at that temperature. What compound has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps ice, but that's 0°C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think about possible decomposition products.

Wait, perhaps G is a different carbonate. For example, if X is a metal carbonate, and Y is something that reacts with it to form a different carbonate as a precipitate. Then upon heating, that carbonate decomposes into oxide and CO2. The oxide would be B. So, for instance, if G is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), heating it would produce CaO and CO2. The melting point of CaO is about 2600°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another angle: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me compute 277 K in Celsius: 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C. So about 4°C. What substance has a melting point around that? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? Wait, no, ammonium nitrate's melting point is higher. What about something else. Wait, water is 0°C, but maybe a different form? Or perhaps a different compound.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think about the reaction. When G is heated, it releases B. So, if G is a carbonate salt, heating could produce a metal oxide and CO2. So B is the oxide. But the oxide's melting point is about 4°C. That doesn't make sense because oxides typically have high melting points. Unless the oxide is something like copper(I) oxide? Wait, copper(I) oxide's melting point is around 1235°C. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Let me think about what else could be a product of heating a carbonate. Wait, perhaps if the carbonate is not of a metal but something else. Or perhaps B is not the oxide but another compound.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. X reacts with Y to produce gas W (maybe CO2), precipitate G, and perhaps other products.

Wait, the product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), but that has four oxygen atoms. Hmm, or maybe the product is a salt with two oxygens. Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that neutralizes the keto acid to form a salt with two oxygens. Wait, for example, if the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), and X is a carbonate, perhaps the reaction produces sodium formate (HCOONa). That has two oxygens in the formate ion (HCOO^-). Yes, that could be.

So, if X is a carbonate, like sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), reacting with formic acid (HCOOH), it would produce sodium formate, carbon dioxide, and water. The product would have two oxygen atoms in the formate ion.

But wait, the problem states that X has a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is the heavier isotope of the carbonate. For example, if the carbonate is sodium, which has a common isotope Na-23, but if it's using a heavier one like Na-25, which is a rare isotope, but in any case, the element is sodium.

Alternatively, maybe X is using a heavier isotope of carbon, like C-13 or C-14, but carbon's isotopes are less likely in this context.

Wait, but the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, in X, one of the elements has a heavier isotope. So, for example, if X is a carbonate, maybe one of the oxygen atoms is a heavier isotope, like O-18 instead of O-16. Or perhaps the sodium is a heavier isotope.

So, moving on, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So, I need to figure out the elements in X, find their lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their atomic masses.

Wait, but the problem says, "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, the elements in X. For example, if X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. So lightest is O (8), heaviest is Na (23). Wait, but the problem says to sum the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. So, in X, the lightest element is O (atomic number 8) and the heaviest is Na (11). So their atomic masses are O is 16, Na is about 23. So 16 + 23 = 39. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the elements are something else. Let me think again. Let's consider the reaction. X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (CO2?), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with a melting point of ~4°C. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So X is probably a sodium salt. Wait, sodium bicarbonate is used in organic chemistry as a base. So maybe X is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3.

So, X is NaHCO3. Let's check the reaction. If Y is an acid, say HCl, then NaHCO3 reacts with HCl to produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. So gas W is CO2, precipitate G would be nothing because all products are soluble. Wait, but that's not a precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, if Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of CaCl2, and X is Na2CO3. Then, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → 2NaCl + CaCO3↓. So G would be CaCO3. Then, upon heating G (CaCO3) decomposes into CaO and CO2. But CaO has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit the B's melting point.

Wait, but earlier I thought B's melting point is about 4°C, which is close to the melting point of something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the elements in X. If X is NaHCO3, then the elements are Na, H, C, O. So lightest is H (atomic number 1), heaviest is Na (11). Atomic masses—H is 1, Na is about 23. Sum is 24. But the options don't have 24. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the heaviest element is O? No, Na is heavier than O.

Wait, perhaps X is a different compound. Another possibility: maybe X is a sulfate. For example, sodium sulfate. But that wouldn't produce CO2 upon reaction with acid. Alternatively, if Y is a metal and X is an acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. Let's think about that. If the product is a salt, perhaps a carboxylate. For example, if the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), and X is a base like NaOH, the reaction would be HCOOH + NaOH → NaHCOO + H2O. The product is sodium formate, which has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. So, that would fit. So X could be a hydroxide, like NaOH.

Wait, but if X is NaOH, reacting with Y (maybe an acid), but that might not produce CO2. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, like sodium carbonate, and the keto acid is formic acid. Then, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2 HCOOH → 2 NaHCOO + CO2↑ + H2O. The product has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion.

So, X could be Na2CO3. Let's see if that fits.

In that case, the elements in X are Na, C, O. So the lightest element is O (atomic number 8), heaviest is Na (11). Their atomic masses: O is 16, Na is about 23. Sum is 16 + 23 = 39. Not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, considering all heavier and lighter isotopes. Oh wait, wait. The question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, so if X contains, say, sodium, carbon, and oxygen, then for each element, the lightest and heaviest isotopes contribute their masses. Wait, no, the question says the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present. So for each element in X, the lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses are summed.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again: "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Ah, perhaps it's that for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses, and then add all those together? Or maybe, for each element present, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes and sum their masses for that element, then add all such sums together.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses of all elements present in X.

Wait, for example, if X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest element is O (atomic number 8), the heaviest is Na (11). Wait, no, O is lighter than Na. Wait, no, atomic number-wise, O is 8, Na is 11. So in terms of mass, O is about 16, Na is 23. So the lightest element in X would be O, the heaviest is Na.

Wait, so the "lightest and heaviest elements" in X are O and Na. So their atomic masses are 16 and 23. Sum is 39, which isn't among the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the heaviest element in X is carbon. No, carbon is lighter than sodium.

Wait, perhaps X is a different compound. Maybe X is something like sodium hydroxide, NaOH. So elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, but the problem says that when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. If X is Na2CO3 and Y is a solution containing Ca^2+, like CaCl2, then the precipitate would be CaCO3. Heating CaCO3 gives CaO and CO2. But CaO's melting point is high.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

So 35 is perhaps 16 + 19 (fluorine?), but wait fluorine is F. Hmm, but if the elements are F and something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the product of a keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a ketone? No, because a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. When it reacts with a base like X, it forms a carboxylate. So the product would have the structure RCOO^-.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So the simplest carboxylate is formate (HCOO^-), which has two oxygens. So maybe the product is a formate.

So, if the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), then when it reacts with a base like NaOH, it forms NaHCOO (sodium formate). So X would be NaOH.

Wait, but earlier I thought X is NaOH, but how does that fit with the initial reaction?

Wait, if X is NaOH, and Y is another substance. Maybe Y is a carbonate. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base, so it might react with something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different base. Let me think.

Wait, another angle: the melting point of B is about 277 K, which is ~4°C. What's a solid that melts around that temperature? Hmm, maybe ammonium chloride? No, I think it's higher. Or perhaps something like paraffin wax, but that's not a compound. Or maybe camphor? No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe ice is 0°C, but that's not a pure substance.

Wait, perhaps B is not a pure element but a compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a different product, like a bicarbonate. Wait, no, bicarbonates decompose upon heating.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the wrong points. Let me try to summarize what I know so far:

- X reacts with Y to produce gas W (probably CO2), precipitate G, and possibly other products.
- G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C).
- The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms.
- X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, so it's probably a base like NaOH, NaHCO3, etc.
- X incorporates a heavier isotope, so one of its elements has a heavier isotope. For example, sodium could be Na-25 instead of Na-23.

If X is NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), then the elements present are Na, H, C, O. So the lightest element is H (mass 1), heaviest is Na (mass ~23). So 1 + 23 = 24. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), the elements are Na, C, O. Lightest is O (16), heaviest Na (23). 16 +23=39. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: What if X is potassium permanganate (KMnO4)? No, that's a strong oxidizing agent, but it doesn't fit the reaction with a keto acid to produce something with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps X is a hydroxide, like KOH. But then, when it reacts with a keto acid, the product would be a potassium salt with the formate ion, which has two oxygens. But then, the elements in KOH are K, O, H. So lightest is H (1), heaviest K (39). 1+39=40. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think about the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Hmm, 25 is near the atomic mass of magnesium (24.3), but perhaps it's considering isotopes. For example, Mg has isotopes up to 26, so if the sum is 25, perhaps that's something else.

Wait, maybe the elements are Chlorine and something else. Chlorine has a light isotope (35Cl) and heavy (37Cl). So if the lightest element is Cl, but that's not possible because Cl is heavier than O, for example.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NH4Cl (ammonium chloride). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product is likely a carboxylic acid salt with the formula RCOO^- M^+.

So, for example, if the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), and X is a base like NaOH, the product is NaHCOO, which has two oxygens in the formate ion. So X would be NaOH.

So, X is NaOH. Then, when NaOH reacts with Y (maybe an acid), it produces gas W (like H2), but wait, that doesn't fit with CO2.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a carbonate. Wait, if X is NaOH and Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, that would not make sense. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution containing a metal ion that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if Y is Cu(NO3)2, and X is NaOH, then the reaction would produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate. But then, the gas W wouldn't be CO2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else, like a carbonate, and Y is an acid.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the possible elements in X.

If X is NaHCO3, elements are Na, H, C, O. So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Another possibility: X is a bicarbonate like NaHCO3, but that doesn't change the element composition.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Maybe X is a chloride. For example, if X is NaCl, but that wouldn't fit with the reaction producing CO2.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate of a heavier element. Wait, but I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, maybe X is a nitride. For example, sodium nitride, but that's not common.

Wait, going back to the gas W. If W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y must produce CO2. So X must contain carbonate or bicarbonate ions.

Thus, X is likely to be a carbonate or bicarbonate. So, X is Na2CO3 or NaHCO3.

Then, when X reacts with an acid (Y), it produces CO2 gas, and a precipitate. Wait, but if Y is an acid, wouldn't the precipitate dissolve? Hmm, maybe Y is a solution of a less soluble salt.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate that reacts with X to form a less soluble carbonate. For example, if Y is a solution of calcium nitrate, and X is Na2CO3, then the reaction would produce CaCO3 precipitate. So G would be CaCO3. Heating CaCO3 would decompose into CaO and CO2. But CaO's melting point is high, so that doesn't match B's melting point of ~4°C.

Hmm, but maybe B is another compound. Alternatively, perhaps G is not a carbonate but something else.

Wait, perhaps X is not a carbonate but a bicarbonate. So, X is NaHCO3. If Y is an acid, like HCl, the reaction would produce NaCl, CO2, and H2O. But that doesn't produce a precipitate, since all are soluble. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a different salt. For example, if Y is a solution of BaCl2, and X is Na2CO3. Then, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + BaCl2 → BaCO3↓ + 2 NaCl. So G is BaCO3. Heating BaCO3 would produce BaO and CO2. The melting point of BaO is around 1920°C, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3. Then, X is Na2CO3 would react to form Ag2CO3, which is a precipitate. But I'm not sure about the melting point of the product upon heating.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. These are all close to certain atomic masses. For example:

- 25 is close to Mg (24.3), but maybe including isotopes.
- 29 is close to Si (28) and maybe including some isotopes.
- 31 is close to S (32), but maybe.
- 35 is close to chlorine (35.45), but perhaps considering isotopes.

Wait, but the question is about the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, if X has elements A and B, with A being lighter and B heavier, then their atomic masses are summed.

Looking at the options:

A)35 → perhaps 19 (F) + 16 (O) = 35? No, 19+16=35. Yes, that's possible.

Wait, if X contains fluorine and oxygen, then their sum is 19 + 16 =35. So option A is 35.

So, under what scenario would X contain F and O?

Wait, X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Fluorine-containing reagents are possible, like TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride), but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate with fluorine, but that's less common.

Wait, another angle: if X is a fluoride, like NaF. Then, when reacting with an acid, it might not produce gas. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, but if X contains F and O, the sum would be 35. So perhaps X is a fluoride carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound altogether. Let's think: if the elements are F and O, then X could be something like NaF·nH2O, but that's a stretch.

Wait, but the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. If X is a fluoride, perhaps the product is a fluoro compound, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the options again. The correct answer is one of these, so perhaps I can figure it out based on the sum.

If the sum is 25 (option B), possible elements could be C (12) and O (16): 12+13=25, but wait, 12+13=25. Oh, wait, that's 25. So if X contains C and O, maybe in a compound like CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains N and O. Nitrogen's lightest isotope is 14, oxygen is 16. 14+11=25? No, 14+11=25? Wait, nitrogen has some isotopes. Wait, if the heaviest isotope is something else.

Wait, maybe the elements are Cl and O. Chlorine's lightest isotope is 35, but that's too big. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the lightest element is O and the heaviest is F. O is 16, F is 19. 16+19=35, which is option A.

So, if X contains O and F, the sum would be 35. Which option is 35? Option A is 35.

So, could X contain O and F?

If X is something like NaF, but that doesn't fit with the reaction producing CO2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the elements are O and Na. O's mass is 16, Na's is 23. 16+23=39, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Wait, another idea: maybe X is something like calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Elements are Ca, C, O. So lightest is O (16), heaviest Ca (40). Sum 56. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Maybe it's a bicarbonate of a different metal.

Wait, perhaps X is ammonium carbonate. Then, elements are C, H, N, O. So lightest H (1), heaviest N (14) or C (12). Wait, no, H is lighter, N is heavier than C. So sum would be 1 +14 =15, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something with only two elements. For example, if X is Na2S, which is used in organic reactions. Then, reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas. But that doesn't fit with W being CO2.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the other clues.

The product of a certain keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. So, the product could be a salt like sodium formate, which has two oxygens in the formate ion.

If X is NaOH, then reacting with formic acid would produce NaHCOO. So, X is NaOH.

Elements in X: Na, O, H. Lightest element is H (mass 1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, like K2CO3. Then, the elements are K, C, O. So lightest O (16), heaviest K (39). Sum 55. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a different compound. Let's think about the reaction again. If X reacts with Y to produce CO2, then X probably contains carbonate or bicarbonate.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe X is calcium bicarbonate, which upon reaction with acid would produce CO2 and CaCO3 precipitate. But then the elements in X would be C, H, O, Ca. So lightest H (1), heaviest Ca (40). 1+40=41. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If the sum is 29, perhaps it's 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) =29. But that's not possible because Cl's lightest isotope is 35, but maybe considering heavier isotopes.

Wait, no, 12 +17=29, but Cl is much heavier. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the elements are nitrogen and oxygen. Nitrogen's lightest isotope is 14, oxygen's lightest is 16. 14+16=30, which is close to option C (31), but not exact.

Alternatively, if one element is O (16) and another is F (19), sum is 35, which is option A.

So considering all this, perhaps the correct answer is A)35.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the elements in Substance X and calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present, considering isotopes. Here's the analysis:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons, suggesting it could be CO₂. This implies that X likely contains carbon and oxygen, as these elements are part of carbonate or bicarbonate compounds.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: When X reacts with liquid Y, a precipitate forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be a compound with a relatively low melting point, possibly related to the decomposition of a carbonate or bicarbonate.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This indicates that X could be a base like NaOH or a carbonate/bicarbonate, as these would react with a keto acid to form a carboxylate salt (e.g., formate, HCOO⁻), which has two oxygen atoms.

4. **Isotope Incorporation**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. For example, sodium (Na) has isotopes like Na-23 and Na-25, or oxygen (O) has isotopes like O-16 and O-18.

5. **Elements in X**: Based on the reactions and the need for X to include a heavier isotope, X is likely a carbonate or bicarbonate compound containing sodium (Na), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). The lightest element in X is oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23).

6. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (O, 16) and heaviest (Na, 23) elements in X sum to 16 + 23 = 39. However, this does not match the given options. Reconsidering the possibility of X containing fluorine (F, atomic mass ~19) and oxygen (O, 16), the sum would be 19 + 16 = 35, which corresponds to option A.

Given the options and the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is **A) 35**, assuming X contains fluorine and oxygen as its lightest and heaviest elements, respectively.

Answer: A
