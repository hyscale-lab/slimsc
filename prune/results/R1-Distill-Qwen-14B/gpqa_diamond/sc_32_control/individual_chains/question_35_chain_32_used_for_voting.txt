Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The problem states that the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, A_y, is given as a 2x2 matrix. It's expressed as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So first, I think I should figure out what the matrix A_y looks like.

Wait, c is h/(4π), right? So multiplying each element of S by c will give A_y. Let me write that out. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so multiplying by c gives A_y as [[0, -i*(h/4π)], [i*(h/4π), 0]]. 

So A_y is a 2x2 matrix:
Row 1: [0, -i h/(4π)]
Row 2: [i h/(4π), 0]

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

Let me write the matrix (A_y - λI):
[[ -λ, -i h/(4π) ],
 [i h/(4π), -λ ]]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - ( -i h/(4π) )*(i h/(4π) ). Calculating each part:

First term: λ².

Second term: (-i)*(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (i h/(4π))² = (i²)(h²/(16π²)) )= (-1)(h²/(16π²)). Wait, but in the determinant, it's minus the product of the off-diagonal terms. So the determinant is λ² - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Wait, actually, the off-diagonal elements are (-i h/(4π)) and (i h/(4π)), so their product is (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2. (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²/(16π²)).

Then the determinant is λ² - (h²/(16π²)) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16π²). Taking the square root, λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, no. Because sqrt(h²/(16π²)) is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are plus and minus that value.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues are real here? Wait, no, because A_y is a Hermitian operator?

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me think about whether A_y is Hermitian. Because the angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, S is the Pauli matrix sigma_y, which is Hermitian. Because S = [[0, -i],[i,0]], and its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i,0]], which is the same as S. So S is Hermitian. Then c is a real constant, so c·S is also Hermitian. So A_y is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvalues λ must be real. So looking at my earlier calculation, λ² = (h/(4π))². So λ = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are those, and the imaginary parts are zero. So looking at the options, none of them talk about purely real eigenvalues except maybe option B.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option A: imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But eigenvalues are real, so this can't be right.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't fit with the eigenvalues I found, which are h/(4π). But wait, what's the value of h? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. But in terms of units or whether the options are in terms of h or in terms of something else?

Wait, perhaps the options are parameterized in terms of ħ. Because ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Because ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is often used in these equations.

So if I write λ = ± ħ/2, which is the same as h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real and are ± ħ/2.

Now looking at the options again.

Option C and D: Let's read them.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. For spin-1/2 particles, like a muon (which is a lepton, so spin-1/2), the square of the angular momentum is A² = (ħ/2)(ħ/2 + 1) ħ²? Wait, no, more accurately, for spin s, A² |s> = s(s+1) ħ² |s>. For s=1/2, A² is (3/4 ħ²). So any eigenstate of Ay (which is a component) should also be an eigenstate of A² because A² commutes with all components of A. So if φ is an eigenvector of Ay, it must also be an eigenvector of A². So option C says it's an eigenfunction of A² but not Az. But if it's an eigenstate of Ay and A², wouldn't it also be an eigenstate of the other components? Wait no, I recall that for angular momentum, the components don't commute, so an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az, unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which only occurs for states with definite m_s, but in this case, since it's an eigenstate of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Az. 

Wait, but I'm getting into a bit of confusion. The point is, for a spin-1/2 system, any eigenstate of one component (say Ay) is not an eigenstate of another component (like Az), because the components don't commute. But it is an eigenstate of A². So option C's statement is correct. So option C says the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A², which is correct, and not of Az, which is also correct. So option C might be a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Well, the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the space, but the question is whether they form a basis for the matrix. Wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors would form an orthogonal basis in 2D space. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, which makes sense. So option D is correct?

But wait, let me think. The matrix operates in a two-dimensional space, and the eigenvectors form a basis for that space. So yes, the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions for Ay. So option D is a correct statement.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So let's look at the options again.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts, but A_y is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues would have imaginary parts, but we know they are real. So B is wrong.

Options C and D are about the properties of eigenfunctions.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Because when I found the eigenvalues, I think I might have missed something. Let me double-check.

The matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4π). So the matrix is:

[0, -i c]
[i c, 0]

The characteristic equation is determinant of (A_y - λ I) = 0.

Which is:

(-λ)(-λ) - ( (-i c) * (i c) ) = 0

Simplify: λ² - ( (-i)(i) c² ) = 0

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So (1) c².

So equation: λ² - (c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c.

So λ is ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers. So the eigenvalues have zero imaginary parts. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct statements must be between C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

As I thought earlier, A² is the square of the angular momentum, so any eigenstate of a component must also be an eigenstate of A² because A² commutes with all components. So, yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². However, they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Well, since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator's matrix. So option D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So both C and D seem correct. But let me read the options again.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since I agree this is correct, then C is a correct statement.

Option D states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Since any set of eigenvectors for a Hermitian matrix forms an orthogonal basis, this is also correct.

Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think about the statement in D. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so it's represented in a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for this space. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions. So D is correct. But wait, the eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis, but the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

But what about option C? Because if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it is automatically an eigenstate of A², since A² commutes with Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is not the case here. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as which statement is correct, so perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps looking at the problem again, I should find out what the options are saying.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

If the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for that space, then D is correct. So both C and D seem correct, but the question says which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of which statements are correct during the calculation.

Wait, during the calculation, when finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statements are true. So for option C, the eigenfunctions of Ay being eigenfunctions of A² would hold because A² and Ay commute.

So let's think about A and Ay. A² is the square of the vector operator, which is A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2. So it commutes with each of the components. So [A², Ay] = 0.

Thus, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space, the matrix is in that basis.

Wait, but the matrix representation is in the standard basis? Or in the eigenbasis? Hmm. The matrix we have is in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the space, but not necessarily the same as the matrix's basis. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the matrix is defined in a particular basis. The eigenfunctions are the vectors that form a basis for the same space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator's space. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct, but the options can't have two correct. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the muon's spin is 1/2, so the dimension is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis. So option D is correct.

But I'm getting stuck between C and D. Let me think again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. This is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². However, since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenstate is not an eigenstate of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix is given in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors may not be the same as the standard basis. Wait, but the standard basis vectors are not necessarily the eigenvectors of Ay. So the matrix is represented in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form another basis. So the statement in D is correct if the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the matrix operator is 2x2, so any set of two eigenvectors can form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct.

But wait, the problem states that the matrix operator Ay has the given form. So the matrix is already given in the standard basis. The eigenvectors might not be the standard basis vectors, so the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions for the matrix in their own right. So D is correct.

But I'm not 100% sure. So perhaps I should go back to the options.

Looking again:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is, the matrix is expressed in the basis of its own eigenfunctions. So if the matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then yes. But the given matrix isn't diagonal. So the matrix is given in the standard basis, not in the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are a different basis. Therefore, D is not correct because the matrix is given in the standard basis, not the eigenbasis. Wait, but the question says that the matrix is given as Ay = c·S, where S is a certain 2x2 matrix. So in that case, the matrix is in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of that matrix. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for the matrix operator. So D is correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the correct answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps not. I'm getting a bit stuck, but looking back, the possible correct statements are C and D.

Wait, the question is: during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So, during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct. So which of the statements is true when I'm solving for eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is true because the operator acts on those functions. But the operator is represented in a specific basis, but the eigenfunctions form a basis themselves. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, and not of Az, which is also correct.

So, considering all this, option C is correct.

The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y \) is:

\[
A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**: 
This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). However, \( A_y \) is a Hermitian operator, meaning its eigenvalues must be real. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are calculated by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These are purely real, so this option is incorrect.

#### **Option B**: 
This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). However, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real and do not match the values given in this option. Thus, this option is also incorrect.

#### **Option C**: 
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of the angular momentum operator). Since \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of \( A \), any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenstate of \( A_y \) is not an eigenstate of \( A_z \). This statement is correct.

#### **Option D**: 
This option states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the two-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) operates, the matrix \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, not necessarily in the eigenbasis. Therefore, this statement is less accurate than Option C.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the properties of the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) during the calculation.

**Answer: C**
