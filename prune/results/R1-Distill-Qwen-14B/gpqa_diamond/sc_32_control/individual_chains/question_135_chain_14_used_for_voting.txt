Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian.

First, the problem gives the Lagrangian as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I remember that the interaction Lagrangian tells us which particles interact with the boson. So here, the boson X is interacting with fermions ψ_f.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions can be produced when X decays, considering their masses. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion being produced. Oh right, because in decay processes, you need to have enough energy to create the particles, so m_X >= 2*m_fermion.

So, the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. Let me list the possible fermions and their masses. Wait, but which fermions are involved here? The interaction term has ψ_f, which I think refers to different fermion types. So I need to know which fermions are accessible given the mass of X.

Let me recall the masses of the known fermions:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): approximately 1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.0045 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV.

Wait, X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. But since each fermion is m, the pair is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 → m ≤ 3 GeV. 

So which fermions have masses ≤3 GeV?

Looking at the list:

- Electron: 0.0005 → yes
- Muon: 0.105 → yes
- Tau: 1.78 → yes, since 2*1.78=3.56 GeV which is more than 6? Wait wait, wait. Wait no, 1.78*2 is 3.56, which is less than 6. So wait, if X is 6 GeV, then 2m_fermion ≤6 → m_fermion ≤3 GeV. So the tau is 1.78 which is less than 3, so that's okay. But wait, the tau's mass is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait, but let me check each fermion. Let's see:

The fermions that are light enough:

- e (mass ~0.0005 GeV) → 2m=0.001 GeV <<6 → allowed
- mu (0.105 GeV) → 0.21 <<6 → allowed
- tau (1.78 GeV) → 3.56 GeV <6 → allowed? Wait, 3.56 is less than 6? Yes. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait, but wait, the tau's mass is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau = 3.56 GeV. So X's mass is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.56 GeV. So yes, allowed.

What about the quarks? Let's see:

- u: 0.003 GeV → 0.006 GeV <<6 → allowed
- d: 0.0045 → 0.009 <6 → allowed
- s: 0.095 → 0.19 <6 → allowed
- c: 1.275 GeV → 2.55 GeV <6 → allowed
- b: 4.13 → 8.26 GeV >6 → not allowed.
- top is way too heavy, so not considered.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are:

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. But wait, what about their antiquarks? Well, when a boson decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, it can be any allowed combination. So the possible decay channels would be:

X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but what about the quarks? Are they allowed to decay into quarks? Because in terms of decay products, if the X can couple to those quarks, then yes. But the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so the interaction term is something like ψ_f^† (something) ψ_f. Wait, wait, the interaction is Lagrangian given as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The standard form for a Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ ψ X, but perhaps I'm getting the notation wrong.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is something like L = λ (ψ_f)^dagger (1 + γ^5) ψ_f X(y). No, wait, the problem gives the Lagrangian as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not sure I parse that correctly. Wait, perhaps it's L = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, but that seems odd. Wait, perhaps it's more like L = λ (f f-bar ψ_f) (v + X) ψ_f. Or perhaps it's f-bar ψ_f X ψ_f. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the interaction: the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f, and the coupling is proportional to λ f f-bar ψ_f. Wait, perhaps f is a field, but I'm not entirely clear on the notation.

But perhaps the key point is that the interaction term allows X to decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermions are accessible given the mass. So, the X can decay into any fermion pair as long as 2m_fermion <= m_X.

So, for X=6 GeV, which fermions are allowed?

As above, the fermions with m_f <=3 GeV:

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

But wait, the bottom quark is about 4.13 GeV, so 2m_b=8.26>6, so not allowed.

So possible decay modes are:

X → e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ū,

d d̄,

s s̄,

c c̄.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's mass is 4.13 GeV, so 2m_b=8.26>6, which is not allowed. So option A includes b, which isn't allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that includes c, which is allowed because 2m_c=2.55 GeV <6 GeV.

But what about b in B? No, option B doesn't have b. So B includes: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but the options have various combinations. Let me look again.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, t tbar, tau+, mu+, e+ etc. Wait, but t is top quark, m_t=173 GeV, way too heavy. So t is excluded. So option C includes t, which is not allowed, so C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, so wait, what's correct? The correct decay channels should include e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So looking at the options:

Option B includes all except b. Let me read option B again.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermions. So option B is the correct one.

But wait, why is option D having b? Because 6 GeV is larger than 2*m_b? Wait, no. m_b is about 4.13 GeV, so 2*m_b=8.26 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option D is incorrect because it includes b.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking again, let me verify the mass thresholds.

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → 2m=0.001 → allowed.

Muon: 0.105 → 0.21 → allowed.

Tau: 1.78 → 3.56 → allowed.

u: 0.003 → 0.006 → allowed.

d: 0.0045 → 0.009 → allowed.

s: 0.095 → 0.19 → allowed.

c: 1.275 → 2.55 → allowed.

So all of these are allowed.

So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs.

Looking again at options:

Option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decay modes of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can couple to fermions, and the decay products must satisfy the condition \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion. This ensures that the boson has enough energy to produce the fermion-antifermion pair.

The masses of the known fermions are as follows:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u = 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 0.0045 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d = 0.009 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 2.55 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) implies that \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This allows decays into fermion-antifermion pairs for \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \), but excludes \( b \) and \( t \) due to their higher masses. The possible decay modes are:

- \( X \to e^+ e^- \)
- \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( X \to u \bar{u} \)
- \( X \to d \bar{d} \)
- \( X \to s \bar{s} \)
- \( X \to c \bar{c} \)

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 8.26 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay modes of \( X \).

Answer: B
