Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism and which compounds exhibit it. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have chiral centers or some sort of asymmetry that leads to this.

Looking at the options:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I need to check each one for the possibility of having chiral centers or other factors that cause optical isomerism.

Starting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, the structure is a biphenyl group with substituents. The substituents are nitro groups on carbons 6 and 6' of each phenyl ring, and the ester groups (since it's a dicarboxylate) are on carbons 2 and 2' of each ring. Wait, wait. So each phenyl ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2?

Wait, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each phenyl, so the substituents are on 2 and 6 positions. But would that create any chiral centers? Wait, no. Because each ring is connected symmetrically. Oh, but wait—wait, the nitro groups are on the same positions on each ring, same with the ester groups. So the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me imagine the structure.

The biphenyl has two rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carbonyl (ester) at position 2. So if the substituents are on opposite ends, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry? Like, a mirror plane. So maybe it's not chiral. But wait, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, then it can't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the molecule is such that each substituent is on an opposite position, making it a meso compound.

Wait, but the substituents are on each ring. Let me think: Each ring has a nitro and a carbonyl. So on each phenyl, nitro is at 6 and ester at 2, which is para to each other. So each ring is symmetric. So when you connect two such rings at position 1, would that create symmetry across the entire molecule? Or perhaps, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So I'm thinking option 1 might not exhibit optical isomerism. Or wait, am I missing something? Because sometimes, even if you have symmetry, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, but I don't think that's the case here. So perhaps option 1 is not a candidate.

Moving to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's a propionate ester with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COO- methyl ester. So the structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from propane), a carbonyl group (from the ester), and a hydrogen. Wait, that's four different groups attached to the same carbon, right? So that carbon is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center, which would allow it to have optical isomerism. So option 2 can exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO. It has two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The ketone is in the center. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-Ph. Now, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (O), and a single bond to another phenyl (wait, no, wait, benzophenone has one central carbon with two phenyl groups and a ketone). Wait, wait, no: benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). The central carbon (the one in the ketone) is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

Wait, but that's symmetric. So the two phenyl groups are on either side of the carbonyl. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry in the middle. Therefore, the molecule is planar and symmetric. So there's no chiral centers, and the molecule is achiral. So it cannot have optical isomerism. So option 3 can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis diastereomer of maleic acid. Wait, wait, no. Fumarate is actually the trans isomer. Wait, I need to recall: fumaric acid is the trans isomer, and maleic acid is the cis. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, wait, no. Let me think. Fumarate is the trans diastereomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-1,2-dimethyl-diepoxyethane? No, wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid, which would be the trans-1,2-dicarboxyethene. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate, which would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

But wait, does that make the molecule chiral? Let me visualize the structure. The molecule is CH₂(COOCH3)₂ with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no: fumarate is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait no. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H, but in the trans configuration. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH for maleic acid? No, wait, no. Let me correct myself: Maleic acid is cis, so the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is trans, so the COOH groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, so the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides.

So when you esterify fumaric acid with methanol, you get dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans diester. So the structure would be CH₂(COOCH3)₂ with a double bond and the ester groups on opposite sides.

Wait, but the molecule in question is (E)-1,2-dimethyl dicarboxylate? So, in this case, the molecule has a double bond, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Now, does this create stereoisomerism?

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs to have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, a molecule with a double bond can have geometric isomerism, but that's a form of stereoisomerism that's different from optical isomerism. Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about the presence of enantiomers. So, geometric isomerism (cis-trans) is a type of stereoisomerism, but it's not the same as optical activity.

Wait, but wait, can a molecule with a double bond have optical isomerism? Only if the molecule itself is chiral. For example, if the double bond leads to an overall chiral structure. Like in the case of allenes or certain bicyclic compounds, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is a trans diester, is the molecule itself chiral?

Wait, so let's imagine the structure: O

        O
        ||
OCH3-C=C-OCH3

In the trans configuration. So, the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. Each side is a mirror image of the other. So, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and isn't a chiral molecule. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure would be:

O
|
O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O=C-OCH3
    |
    O

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me draw it correctly. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH₂(COOCH3)₂ with a double bond. Actually, no, wait. The correct structure is:

O
|
O=C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O=C-OCH3
    |
    O

Wait, no, that can't be. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration. So the two COOCH3 groups are opposite each other. So if you have a double bond with two identical groups on either side, like two ester groups, and they're in a trans configuration, does that make the molecule chiral?

Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So, if the two substituents on either end of the double bond are the same, then even if they're trans, the molecule is symmetrical. Because the two COOCH3 groups are identical, and the double bond is in the center. So, the molecule would actually have a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond.

So in that case, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of cis and trans isomers? Well, the question isn't about those; it's specifically about optical isomerism, which is about enantiomers. So, if the molecule isn't chiral, it can't have enantiomers. So, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. Suppose I have a molecule with a double bond, and each carbon of the double bond has two identical substituents. Then the molecule is symmetrical. So, for example, (E)-but-2-ene is a symmetrical molecule, so it's not chiral. Similarly, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon has two identical substituents. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but then, what about if the substituents are not identical? For example, if one substituent is different on each side of the double bond, but arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral. That's when you get enantiomers. But in option 4, the substituents are the same on each side. So the molecule is not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of another example. Aspirin is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. But if I modify it to have different groups on each side of the double bond, perhaps it would become chiral. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate, which has same groups on both sides, is not chiral.

So based on this, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another point. If the molecule has a double bond and the substituents are same on both sides but in a trans configuration, is there any possibility of having optical isomerism? No, because the molecule is symmetric and thus not chiral.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: if the substituents are same, but the molecule has a different arrangement that causes chirality. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on the double bond, and the other groups are symmetric. So, no, that's not the case.

So, for the options:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro... Probably not, because the substituents are symmetric.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, because it has a chiral center.

3. Benzophenone: No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. If the substituents on the double bond are the same, the molecule is not chiral. So, it can't have optical isomerism. So, that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, even if a molecule has a point of symmetry, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are same on both ends, and the double bond is in the center. So, it's definitely symmetric. No optical isomerism.

Now, let's go back to option 1. The first option is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So, considering the biphenyl structure, the substituents are arranged on each ring.

Wait, the biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester group at 2. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Now, the positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other, right? Because on a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, and position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, 2 and 6 are across from each other, making the substituents para to each other on each ring.

Wait, wait, no: position 2 and 6 are across from each other on a benzene ring. So, for each ring, the nitro and ester groups are para to each other. So each phenyl ring has substituents that are para. So, each ring is identical. Now, when connected via position 1, the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents on each ring are mirrored.

Wait, but perhaps the entire molecule has a center of symmetry. Let's imagine looking at it. Each substituent on one ring is mirrored on the other. So, if you have a nitro group on one ring's position 6, the other ring's position 6 (which is across from where it's connected) would also have a nitro group. Similarly, the ester groups are both at position 2, which is across from the connecting position.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the arrangement isn't symmetric. Let me consider the actual structure. The biphenyl is connected at position 1. So, each ring's position 1 is connected. Then, on each ring, position 2 is ortho to position 1, and position 6 is also ortho to position 1 but on the other side. So, in each ring, the substituents are at ortho positions relative to the connecting position.

Wait, so each ring has two substituents: nitro at position 6 and ester at position 2. Since position 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1, but on opposite sides. So, each ring's substituents are at ortho positions, but on opposite sides.

Wait, but in such a case, the entire molecule may not have a plane of symmetry. Because when you connect two rings at position 1, and each has substituents on both sides, perhaps the arrangement doesn't mirror itself, leading to a chiral molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two rings. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the connecting position, perhaps there's no symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should think of this as a biphenyl with substituents on each ring at positions 2 and 6, and the rings connected at position 1. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that each has a nitro and an ester group at positions that are para to each other, but when connected, does that create any symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, but I'm not sure. I'm a bit confused here, but I'll proceed.

So, based on my analysis:

- Option 1: No optical isomerism.

- Option 2: Yes.

- Option 3: No.

- Option 4: No.

Wait, but wait, the options given are for which compounds show optical isomerism.

Looking at the options again:

The options are:

A) 1,2 and 4.

B) 3 and 4.

C) 2 and 3.

D) 1 and 2.

So, according to my analysis, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2 positions. So, each ring has nitro and ester groups in para positions. So, when you have two such rings connected at position 1, each substituent is para on each ring. Now, the biphenyl structure can have two possible configurations: the two rings can be in a coplanar (para) or non-coplanar (meta) arrangement, but here, they are connected at position 1, so perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, but wait, the biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center. But the substituents could create a chiral arrangement. Alternatively, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about option 1. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but then I'm left with only option 2 as the correct answer. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1,2,4. So if option 1 is correct, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 1.

Alternative approach: for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry.

Option 1: Is there a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is a biphenyl with substituents. The biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center, but perhaps the substituents create one.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring is connected at 1, and each has substituents at 2 and 6. So, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let me imagine: if each substituent on one ring is mirrored on the other, then the molecule is symmetric.

But each substituent on each ring is a nitro and a carboxylate. So, perhaps the arrangement is symmetric, making the molecule achiral.

So, I'm convinced option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central CH(OH)CH2 group? Wait, no: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH(OH), attached to CH3 (from propane) and COOCH3. So the groups are:

- CH3 (methyl)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- COOCH3 (ester)
- CH2- (from the rest of the molecule?)

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3? No. Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3? No, propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure correctly.

Propanoic acid is CH₂CH₂COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, propanoate has three carbons: the COO- is on the third carbon. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the structure.

Propanoate is CH₂CH₂COOCH3. So propanoate is CH₂CH₂COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH₂CH₂COOCH3? No, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the second carbon (the middle CH2) attached to OH, CH2, and two carbons. So that would make it a chiral center? No, wait, no.

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. The middle CH2 has two CH2 groups attached (from the left and right). So, the groups on the middle carbon are:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2-COOCH3
- Two methyl groups?

Wait, no. Let me draw it correctly.

The structure for 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester is: CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Propanoate is:

CH3CH2COOCH3 is methyl propanoate. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But in that case, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two methyl groups (from CH2 on either side? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is CH₂, which is connected to:

- OH group (on the same carbon)
- CH3 (from CH2-)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the other side)
- And another CH2? No, wait, the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate has three carbons in the chain. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the middle one) is CH2. Wait, but that would mean the middle carbon has two CH2 groups attached, which are identical. So, the groups on that carbon would be:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the middle carbon (carbon 2) is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- OH group
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, wait. No, that's not correct. Because propanoate is CH₂CH₂COOCH3, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3. So the middle CH₂ is connected to:

- two CH₂ groups (on either side)
- an OH group
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, but that can't be. Because propanoic acid is CH₂CH₂COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH₂(OH)CH₂COOH. Its methyl ester would be CH₂(OH)CH₂COOCH3.

So, in that case, the middle carbon (CH₂) is attached to:

- two CH₂ groups (left and right)
- an OH group
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the middle carbon has two identical substituents (the two CH₂ groups), so it can't be a chiral center. Because a chiral center requires four different substituents.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the middle carbon is CH₂(OH), then it's attached to two CH₂ groups (left and right), an OH, and a hydrogen. But wait, no. Let me make it clear.

The structure is CH₂(OH)-CH₂-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (CH₂) is connected to:

- CH₂(OH) group on one side,
- CH₂-COOCH3 group on the other,
- a hydrogen, and
- another hydrogen?

Wait, no. Wait, each CH₂ has two hydrogens. So the structure would be:

CH₂(OH)-CH₂-COOCH3.

But in that case, the middle CH₂ is attached to:

- two CH₂ groups (left and right)
- two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. That would make the middle carbon a chiral center, because it's attached to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- OH
- H.

Yes, that's correct. So, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, that's a chiral center. So, the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism. So, option 2 is correct.

So now, let's reevaluate option 4. Wait, earlier I thought option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism, but perhaps I was wrong.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Its structure is (E)-1,2-dicarboxyethylene. When esterified with methanol, you get dimethyl fumarate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
  |
  O

But wait, no. The structure is more accurately CH₂(COOCH3)₂ with a double bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

No, that's not correct. Fumarate ester is:

The structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: Fumarate is the trans diacid. So, the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not correct. No, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the trans configuration. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH for maleic acid (cis), and HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH for fumaric acid, but no. Wait, no, I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, maleic acid is cis diacid, so the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is trans. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the trans diester. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this create a chiral molecule?

Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So, in this case, the molecule has two identical ester groups on each end of a double bond, arranged trans. So, the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. Therefore, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another approach: if the molecule has a double bond and the substituents are same on each side, but arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But in dimethyl fumarate, because the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two ester groups. Hence, it's achiral.

So, correct so far: option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have a choice with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of option 1.

So, going back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, and the rings are connected at position 1.

Let me consider the arrangement. If you imagine each ring, the nitro and ester are at para positions relative to each other. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para.

Now, when the two rings are connected at position 1, the substituents would be arranged in such a way that each ring's substituents are on opposite sides relative to the connecting position.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or perhaps there's no symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, the biphenyl itself is a symmetrical structure, but the substituents could break that symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Maybe this would require drawing the structure, but since I can't do that, I'll have to think differently.

Another approach: if the molecule has a center of symmetry, it's achiral. So, any substituent that is mirrored across that center would make it achiral.

In option 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para. So, each ring is symmetrical across its own para axis. When connected to another ring at position 1, perhaps the overall structure remains symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps each substituent on one ring has a corresponding substituent on the other ring, making the molecule symmetric. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm not confident, but perhaps option 1 is not a chiral molecule.

So, if only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again:

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4.

B) 3 and 4.

C) 2 and 3.

D) 1 and 2.

Since option 2 is correct, perhaps option A includes it. But if option 1 is incorrect, then option A would be incorrect. But according to the analysis, only option 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have optical isomerism?

Wait, another possibility: if the molecule has a double bond and the groups on either side are different, it can be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, both substituents are the same (COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetric. So, no.

Wait, unless the molecule has more than one chiral center. But in dimethyl fumarate, the only chiral possibility is the double bond, but the substituents are the same, so it's symmetric.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Based on the options given, and my analysis, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think about option 4 again. Could it have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral?

Wait, another possibility: the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral.

So, I'm left with only option 2 as correct. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 1. Let me think again. Could option 1 be a chiral molecule?

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Each ring has a nitro at position 6 and ester at 2. The rings are connected at position 1. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. Now, when the rings are connected, the substituents on each ring are on opposite sides relative to the connecting position.

So, perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetric, making it achiral. Or perhaps it's chiral.

Hmm, I'm not sure, but given that I'm pressed for time, I'll proceed.

So, according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct. But looking at the options, none of them include only option 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps option 1 has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, if the central carbon (where the two rings are connected) is a chiral center. But biphenyl's connecting carbon is usually not a chiral center because it's connected to two rings and two other substituents (if any). But in this case, the connecting carbon is part of each ring, so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps option 1 is not chiral.

So, based on all this, the correct answer would be only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of option 4.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, even if the substituents are the same, the molecule could be chiral if the arrangement isn't symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are in a way that a plane of symmetry isn't possible. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, so the molecule is not chiral.

So, perhaps only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂(COOCH3)₂ with a double bond. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, if the molecule is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond, making it CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. No, that's not the case. The correct structure is actually (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester, which would have the structure CH₂(COOCH3)₂ with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

In this case, each substituent on the double bond is the same, so the molecule is symmetric. Thus, not chiral.

So, I think I'm confident that only option 2 is correct.

But looking at the options again, option A is 1,2,4. If I thought option 1 and 2 are correct, but 4 isn't, then option A would be incorrect. But if only 2 is correct, there's no option for that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Perhaps option 4 is correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, and its structure allows for a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the initial analysis, I think only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option 4 can exhibit geometric isomerism, but that's not the same as optical isomerism. So, no.

Wait, let's look at the options again. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct. So none of the options match, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: option 1 has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps option D is correct, which includes options 1 and 2.

But earlier analysis suggested option 1 is not correct. So, perhaps I was wrong about option 1.

Wait, perhaps option 1 is a biphenyl with substituents that create a chiral environment. For example, the substituents are on positions that prevent a plane of symmetry.

Let me think: each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 2 and 6. So, the substituents on each ring are para, but when connected at position 1, the overall molecule might not have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are on opposite sides of the connecting position. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

In that case, option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then options 1 and 2 are correct, making option D the correct answer.

So, perhaps I was wrong earlier about option 1. So, I'll go with option D as the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This molecule consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at position 6 and ester groups at position 2 on each ring. The biphenyl is symmetric, and the substituents (nitro and ester groups) are para to each other on each ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the two rings, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exist as non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (C₆H₅)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetric, with a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups. This symmetry makes it achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of maleic acid, with the structure CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetric due to the identical substituents on each side of the double bond, and it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, only **Option 2** exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided answer choices include only Option 2. If we assume the analysis of Option 1 is incorrect and the molecule is chiral, then both Options 1 and 2 would exhibit optical isomerism, making **Option D** the correct answer.
