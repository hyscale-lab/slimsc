Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? Resonances in particle physics are like unstable particles that decay quickly. The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, decay distance... I think that's related to how far the particle travels before decaying. Oh yeah, I remember something about the mean lifetime and velocity being involved. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the mean lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), where β is the velocity over the speed of light. So the formula should be distance = βcτ.

But wait, how do I get the mean lifetime from the given width Γ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Since the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, ΔE ≈ Γ, and the lifetime τ is approximately Δt. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, more accurately, the relation is Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to be careful with the units here.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ in GeV·s? Or wait, let me recall the constants. ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because I think h is approximately 4.135667696 ×10^-15 eV·s, so divided by 2π gives ħ in eV·s. But since we're working in GeV, I should convert that.

Alternatively, another approach: since Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime τ is inverse of Γ in natural units. Wait, natural units are where ħ = c = 1, but when converting to SI units, I need to handle the units correctly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity β of the meson. Since production energy E is given, and mass m, I can find β using the relativistic energy formula.
3. Calculate the mean decay distance as L = β c τ.

So, let's take it step by step.

First, calculate τ. The width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

We have ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 is 32e-2, so 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is actually (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, 1e-25 multiplied by 20.56875 is 2.056875e-24? Wait, 1e-25 * 20.56875 is 2.056875e-24, yes.

Wait, wait, no: 1e-25 multiplied by 20.56 is 2.056e-24. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, find the velocity β. The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass m is 1.2 GeV. The relativistic energy formula is E = γ m c², but since we're working in units where c=1 (natural units), E = γ m. So γ = E/m. Wait, but then β can be found from γ. Because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²).

So, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ = 6.6667. Now, to find β.

We know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So 1/γ² = 1 - β². Therefore, β² = 1 - 1/γ².

Compute 1/γ²: 1/( (8/1.2)² )= 1/( (6.6667)^2 ) ≈ 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225.

So β² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So β = sqrt(0.9775). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

Alternatively, let me compute it more accurately. 0.9887 squared is 0.9775 approximately.

So β ≈ 0.9887.

Alternatively, let's compute sqrt(0.9775) numerically. Let's see: 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.0171 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97757569, which is a bit more than 0.9775. So the square root is about 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887.

Now, compute the mean decay length L = β c τ.

We have β ≈ 0.9887, c ≈ 3e8 m/s, τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute each part:

β c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by τ: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 m.

Multiplying the coefficients: 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's compute that.

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ Let's see: 2.056875 * 0.966 ≈ 2.056875 * 0.9=1.8511875; 2.056875 * 0.066≈ 0.136. So sum is about 1.851 + 0.136 = 1.987. So total is 4.11375 + 1.987 ≈ 6.099.

Wait, perhaps better to do 2.966 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈  Let's compute 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483; 2.966 * 0.006875 ≈ approx 0.0204.

So 0.1483 + 0.0204 = 0.1687.

So total is 5.932 + 0.1687 = 6.1007.

So the product is 6.1007e(8 -24) m = 6.1007e-16 m.

Wait, 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.1007e-16 m. Looking at the options:

Options are:
A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m
B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m
C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m
D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating τ. Let me recheck that step.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 ÷ 0.32: 0.32 × 20 = 6.4, so 20.56875.

So τ = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta.

Wait, let's recalculate gamma.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

Gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So that's correct.

Gamma squared is (6.6666667)^2 = 44.444444...

So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444444 = 0.0225 exactly. So 1 - beta squared = 0.0225 → beta squared is 0.9775 → beta is sqrt(0.9775).

Wait, compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

What's 0.9887^2? 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 0.98 * 0.98 is 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0087 * 2 = 0.0171 (approx).

0.0087^2 is 0.00007569.

So total is 0.9604 + 0.0171 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97757569.

But we have 0.9775, so the square is a bit less. So sqrt(0.9775) is a little less than 0.9887. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.9885^2.

0.9885 * 0.9885.

Let me compute 9885 * 9885:

But maybe an easier way: 0.9885^2 = (1 - 0.0115)^2 = 1 - 0.023 + 0.00013225 = 0.97713225.

Wait, but that's 0.97713225, which is less than 0.9775.

So 0.9885^2 = 0.97713225.

We need 0.9775, which is 0.00036775 higher. So each 0.0001 increase in beta would add approximately 2*beta*0.0001 + (0.0001)^2 to the square.

So let's let beta = 0.9885 + x, and find x such that (0.9885 + x)^2 = 0.9775.

We have 0.97713225 + 2*(0.9885)*x + x^2 = 0.9775.

Assuming x is small, x^2 can be neglected.

So 2 * 0.9885 * x ≈ 0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.

So 1.977 x ≈ 0.00036775 → x ≈ 0.00036775 / 1.977 ≈ approximately 0.0001864.

So beta is about 0.9885 + 0.0001864 ≈ 0.9886864.

Which is approximately 0.9887. So my initial approximation was correct.

So beta is about 0.9887.

So back to the calculation: L = beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

beta is 0.9887.

So beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Which is 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.

Hmm, 2.966 * 2.056875.

Wait, 2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = let's compute 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483, 2.966 * 0.006875 ≈ 0.0204.

Total for 0.056875 is 0.1483 + 0.0204 = 0.1687.

So 5.932 + 0.1687 ≈ 6.1007.

So 6.1007e-16 m, which is about 6.1e-16 m.

But none of the options match this. The options are A) 5.02e-16, D) 4.06e-16. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma, or in the units.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the production energy is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. So E = gamma * m c², but since we're using GeV and it's natural units, E = gamma * m.

So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of tau. Let me recalculate tau.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

Since ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, and Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is the kinetic energy? No, the question says production energy, which I think is the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So I think that part is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Because sometimes E is the total energy, which is different from gamma * m c^2 when considering momentum.

Wait, but in this case, E is given as 8 GeV, which is the total energy, so yes, E = gamma m c^2, but since we're in GeV and c=1, it's E = gamma m. So that's correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta.

Wait, yes, that's what I did. So L = beta * c * tau.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the formula is L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta) ), but no, that doesn't make sense because gamma is already accounted for in the velocity. Wait, no: lifetime in rest frame is tau_0 = ħ / Γ. The moving frame's tau is gamma * tau_0. Wait a second! Oh no, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. The proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. Then, the lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

Wait, that's a key point! I think I confused the proper lifetime with the observed lifetime. Because the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the formula should be tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Wait, earlier I thought tau_0 = ħ / Gamma, but that's incorrect. Because the lifetime measured in the rest frame is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. When you boost to the lab frame, the lifetime becomes tau = gamma * tau_0.

So my earlier approach was incorrect. I should have tau = gamma * (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, this is a critical mistake. Let's correct this.

Gamma (the Lorentz factor) is E/m, which is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Tau in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is ħ / Gamma.

So tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = (6.6667) * (2.056875e-24) ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Wait, that makes the lifetime longer, as expected.

So now, let's recalculate the decay length.

L = beta * c * tau_lab.

Beta is 0.9887.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau_lab = 1.37125e-23 s.

So beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau_lab: 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23.

Compute 2.966 * 1.37125 ≈ 4.0655. Because 3 * 1.37125 is 4.11375, but 2.966 is a bit less than 3; 2.966 * 1.37125 = let's compute:

1.37125 * 2.966:

= 1.37125 * 2 + 1.37125 * 0.966.

= 2.7425 + (1.37125 * 0.966).

Compute 1.37125 * 0.966:

Approx: 1.37125 * 1 = 1.37125

Minus 1.37125 * 0.034 (since 1 - 0.966 = 0.034).

1.37125 * 0.034 ≈ 0.0466.

So 1.37125 - 0.0466 ≈ 1.3246.

So total is 2.7425 + 1.3246 ≈ 4.0671.

So approximately 4.0671e(8 -23) m = 4.0671e-15 m.

Wait, but 1e8 * 1e-23 = 1e-15. So 4.0671e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.067 is very close to 4.0655. Probably due to more precise calculation.

Wait, let me compute 2.966 * 1.37125 more accurately.

Compute 1.37125 * 2.966.

Breaking it down:

1.37125 * 2 = 2.7425.

1.37125 * 0.9 = 1.234125.

1.37125 * 0.06 = 0.082275.

1.37125 * 0.006 = 0.0082275.

Adding these up: 2.7425 + 1.234125 = 3.976625; +0.082275 →4.0589; +0.0082275=4.0671275.

So 4.0671275e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. Probably due to rounding in the intermediate steps.

So the correct answer should be approximately 4.065e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

So, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is related to the mean lifetime \( \tau \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \implies \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{(in natural units, \( c = 1 \), so \( E = \gamma m \))}.
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

we calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \implies \beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2} = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 \implies \beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta c \tau.
\]

Substituting:
- \( \beta = 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we find:

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, calculate \( \beta c \):

\[
\beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Then, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (2.966 \cdot 2.056875) \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Compute \( 2.966 \cdot 2.056875 \):

\[
2.966 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 6.1007.
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 6.1007 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Adjust for time dilation
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau \) by:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0.
\]

Substituting \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) and \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

Now, recalculate \( L \) using the corrected \( \tau \):

\[
L = \beta c \tau = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23}.
\]

First, calculate \( \beta c \):

\[
\beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Then, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} = (2.966 \cdot 1.37125) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Compute \( 2.966 \cdot 1.37125 \):

\[
2.966 \cdot 1.37125 \approx 4.0671.
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to \( 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
