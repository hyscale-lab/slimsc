Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and then pick the correct statement from the options.

Wait, so the first thing I should do is write down the matrix for Ay. Since Ay = c*S, and S is given, I can compute Ay's matrix form. Let's compute c*S. c is h/(4π), so each element of S is multiplied by this constant.

Matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, Ay would be:
[ (0)(h/(4π))   (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ (i)(h/(4π))    0 ]

Which simplifies to:
[ 0         (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  0        ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I'll set up the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:
[ -a          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a         ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * (i h)/(4π) ) ]

Let me calculate each part. The (1,1) and (2,2) terms are -a, so the product is a². The off-diagonal terms: multiply (-i h)/(4π) and (i h)/(4π) gives [ (-i)(i) * h² ] / (16 π²). 

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes (1 * h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant equation is:

a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π )

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the determinant calculation again. The determinant is (a)^2 - ( ( (-i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π) ) ) ), because the product of the off-diagonal terms in a 2x2 matrix is (element[0][1]*element[1][0]). So the term is ( -i * i ) * (h/(4π))^2.

Wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²)/(16 π²). So the equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). 

Hmm, but wait, these are the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, let's check. 

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and the real parts are ±h/(4π). But that doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are real, not complex. Because in the matrix Ay, after multiplying by c, does the matrix have real entries? Let me check.

Looking back at Ay's matrix: the (0,1) element is (-i h)/(4π), which is a purely imaginary number. The (1,0) element is (i h)/(4π), also purely imaginary. So Ay is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonals and purely imaginary off-diagonal terms. 

Wait, but when I calculated the eigenvalues, they came out to be real. Because the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero, and the product is h²/(16 π²). So the eigenvalues are ± a, where a is h/(4π). So they are real numbers. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts is wrong, except if I'm missing something.

Wait, but the eigenvalues are real. So the options A and B which have imaginary parts in the eigenvalues must be incorrect. Because in this case, the eigenvalues are real. So A and B are out.

Looking at the options, option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, A_z. So, wait, A^2 would be the square of the angular momentum component, and for spin-1/2 particles, A^2 would have eigenvalues (ħ^2)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A^2 has eigenvalues (ħ^2)( (1/2)(3/2) )= (3/4) ħ².

Wait, but in this case, Ay is a component of the spin. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then what about A^2? Since A^2 is the square of the magnitude of the angular momentum, which is a Casimir operator and commutes with all components, including Ay. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A^2. So option C's first part is correct. But the second part says it's not an eigenstate of Az, the Z-component. Well, for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of the eigenstates of Az. So they don't typically share eigenstates unless the state is a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't the case for different components. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, so option C's statement is correct. So option C could be the correct choice.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions are probably the standard basis vectors. Well, the eigenvectors of Ay would form an eigenbasis for Ay. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis vectors of the operator, which is true? Not exactly. The eigenvectors form a basis, but the question is whether they're the basis functions for Ay. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps option D is correct. Wait, but the question says during the calculation, which statement is correct. So, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenvalues I found are real, so options A and B are incorrect because they suggest that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts. So the only possible correct options are C and D.

Looking back at the options: Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That is, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. Well, any operator's eigenvectors (if they are complete and orthogonal) form a basis. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors would form a basis for the 2D space, so yes, that's correct. So option D is a correct statement.

But wait, looking at the options, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct? Or perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let's read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components, any eigenstate of Ay must also be an eigenstate of A². So the first part of C is correct. The second part, that it's not an eigenfunction of Az, is correct because the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of the Az eigenstates. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis for the vector space (if they are diagonalizable, which they are in this case since the matrix is 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues).

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D might be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, what about the structure of the matrix. Since Ay has eigenvalues ±h/(4π), and eigenfunctions that are the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions are orthogonal and can form a basis. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait, the matrix S is given, and Ay is c*S. So when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the eigenvectors would form a basis for the space, so D is correct. But I'm a bit confused because looking back at the problem, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation, so perhaps C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvectors.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Let's find the eigenvectors for each.

First, for a= h/(4π).

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a      ]

Substituting a = h/(4π):

[ -h/(4π)   (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -h/(4π) ]

To find the eigenvector, we can set up the equations:

(-h/(4π)) φ1 + (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = 0

( i h/(4π) ) φ1 + (-h/(4π)) φ2 = 0

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (-1/(4π)) [ h φ1 + i h φ2 ] = 0 → h φ1 + i h φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2

Equation 2: (i/(4π)) h φ1 - (1/(4π)) h φ2 = 0 → i φ1 - φ2 =0 → φ1 = (1/i) φ2 → φ1 = -i φ2 (since 1/i = -i )

So both equations give φ1 = -i φ2. So the eigenvector can be written as [φ1, φ2]^T = [ -i φ2, φ2 ]^T. Let φ2 =1, then the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T. We can normalize it if needed, but for eigenvectors, any scalar multiple is fine.

Similarly, for a= -h/(4π):

The matrix Ay - (-a) I = Ay + a I:

[ h/(4π)   (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  h/(4π) ]

The equations become:

h/(4π) φ1 + (-i h)/(4π) φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2

( i h/(4π) ) φ1 + h/(4π) φ2 = 0 → i φ1 + φ2 =0 → φ1 = -i φ2

Wait, substituting φ1 = i φ2 into equation 2:

i*(i φ2) + φ2 = (-1) φ2 + φ2 = 0 → which holds. So the eigenvector is [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenfunctions are the vectors ( -i, 1 ) and ( i, 1 ), or any scalar multiples.

Now, looking at option C: The eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A². Well, since A² is the square of the operator, and A² = (h/(4π) )² (S·S) ? Wait, S is a spin operator, right? Wait, no, S is given as a matrix here, and the operator Ay is c·S, where c is h/(4π). So S is a 2x2 matrix representing the spin component in y-direction. So the square of A would be (c S)^2 = c² S².

But what's S²? S is a 2x2 matrix, so S^2 is:

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S² = S * S.

Compute each element:

(0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1)=1.

Similarly, (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0 +0=0.

Second row:

(i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

(i)(-i) + (0)(0) = (-i^2) = 1.

Wait, so S² is [[1, 0], [0, 1]] which is the identity matrix I.

So S² = I.

Therefore, A² = (c S)^2 = c² S² = c² I.

So the eigenvalues of A² would be c², since it's c² times the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenvector of A² with eigenvalue c². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of option C says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Az is the z-component of the angular momentum operator, which would be a different matrix. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of Ay (like [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ]) are not eigenstates of Az. Because Az has eigenstates |↑> and |↓> which are (1,0) and (0,1), perhaps. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are superpositions, not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix operator Ay is represented in the basis of its own eigenfunctions. That is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis (they are orthogonal and span the space). So the matrix representation of Ay in its eigenbasis would be diagonal, with eigenvalues on the diagonal. So option D is also correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as possible statements during the calculation. So which one is correct?

Wait, looking back, the question gives four options. Let's reevaluate all options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. That is, the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator, which is true because any square matrix can be diagonalized by its eigenvectors (if they are distinct, which they are in this case). So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: The basis functions for the matrix operator Ay refer to the basis in which the operator is represented. In this problem, the operator is represented with respect to the standard basis, not its eigenbasis. So the eigenvectors form a different basis. So if you change the basis to the eigenvectors, then Ay would be diagonal. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions for Ay's diagonal representation, but not the standard basis. So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay as given (which is in the standard basis). So perhaps option D is incorrect because the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenfunctions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions form a basis, which is correct. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The matrix Ay is given in the standard basis, which is the computational basis, perhaps. The eigenvectors form another basis. So they are the basis functions of the operator when it's diagonalized. So I'm a bit confused about option D's wording: "the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix operator is given in the standard basis. Therefore, the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the given matrix. Because the given matrix is in the standard basis, not the eigenbasis. So the statement in option D would be incorrect. Because the basis functions (basis vectors) for the matrix as given are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenfunctions. So option D is incorrect.

That leaves option C as the correct statement. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C is correct.

Wait, but option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I'm not sure. Maybe the way the question is phrased, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, so yes, they're the basis functions. So option D's statement is correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recheck each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I said earlier, this is correct because A² commutes with all components, so any eigenstate of Ay is also eigenstate of A². And since the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of Az eigenstates, they aren't eigenstates of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator's matrix is given in the standard basis, the eigenfunctions are another basis. So the statement is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, only one can be correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvalues are not h/(4π) but something else. Wait, no, I think I did that correctly. The determinant came out to a^2 = (h/(4π))², so a= ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement: the operator is Ay = c · S, where c = h/(4π), and S is given. So the eigenvalues are c times the eigenvalues of S.

What are the eigenvalues of S? Let's find them. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The trace is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (i*(-i)) )= 0 - ( -i^2 )= 0 - (1) )= -1. So the eigenvalues of S satisfy λ^2 +1=0 → λ= ±i.

So the eigenvalues of Ay = c S are c * λ = (h/(4π)) * (±i) ) → ± i h/(4π).

Wait wait wait, this changes everything! Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought the eigenvalues were real, but no, the eigenvalues of S are ±i, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (i) and c * (-i) → (h/(4π)) * i and -(h/(4π)) * i.

So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Oh my, that completely changes the analysis.

So my earlier analysis was incorrect. I made a mistake when calculating the determinant of (Ay - a I). Oh no, I see where I went wrong.

So let me redo the calculation. The matrix Ay is:

[0, (-i h)/(4π)]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

The characteristic equation is det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

( -i * i ) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π )

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier approach where S's eigenvalues are ±i. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's compute the eigenvalues of S correctly. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So to find its eigenvalues, solve det(S - λ I) = 0.

Matrix S - λ I is:

[ -λ, -i ]
[ i, -λ ]

The determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (−i)(i) ) = λ² − ( i*(-i) ) → i*(-i) is -i² = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² =1 → λ= ±1.

Wait, wait, that's different. Then the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So then the eigenvalues of Ay are c * (±1) → ± c → ± h/(4π).

But that's conflicting with the earlier characteristic equation approach. So which is correct?

Wait, let me compute the determinant again for S - λ I.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S - λ I is [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - [ (-i)(i) ) ]

But (-i)(i) = -(i^2) )= -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c * 1 = h/(4π) and c * (-1) = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, which matches the earlier calculation.

Wait, but earlier I thought the eigenvalues of S were ±i, which must have been a miscalculation. So I'm confused now. Which is correct?

Wait, let's compute S squared. S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. S squared is:

First row:

(0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) )= 0 +1=1.

(0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0.

Second row:

(i)(0) + (0)(i) )=0.

(i)(-i) + (0)(0) )= -i^2 = 1.

So S² = [[1,0],[0,1]] = I. So the eigenvalues of S must satisfy λ^2 =1, so λ=±1. Yes, that's correct. So the eigenvalues are indeed ±1. So the earlier calculation was correct. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). 

So the conclusion is that the eigenvalues of Ay are real, ± h/(4π). So any option that claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. As I thought before, this is correct because A² is a Casimir operator and commutes with all components. So the eigenstates of Ay are also eigenstates of A². And they are not eigenstates of Az since their states are superpositions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay given above. I think this is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, but the matrix Ay is given in the standard basis. So the statement may be incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, the statement in D says: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So during the calculation, which statement is correct? Well, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the space (since they form a basis), but the matrix representation of Ay in that basis would be diagonal. So option D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, hence are the basis functions for the matrix operator.

But wait, the matrix operator as given is in the standard basis, so the statement in D may be incorrect. I'm a bit confused. So perhaps the correct statement is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So option C is correct.

So the correct option is C?


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = 0,
\]

where \( A_y = c \cdot S \). Substituting \( A_y \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} 
-a & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\ 
\frac{i h}{4\pi} & -a 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - \left(-\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right)\left(\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives:

\[
a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
-\frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\ 
\frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi} 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 
\phi_1 \\ 
\phi_2 
\end{bmatrix}
= 0.
\]

From the equations, \( \phi_1 = -i \phi_2 \). Choosing \( \phi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\phi = \begin{bmatrix} 
-i \\ 
1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), a similar calculation gives the eigenvector:

\[
\phi = \begin{bmatrix} 
i \\ 
1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Analysis of the Options

#### **Option A**: 
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), with no imaginary parts.

#### **Option B**: 
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).

#### **Option C**: 
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a Casimir operator that commutes with all components of angular momentum, so any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as they are superpositions of \( A_z \)-eigenstates.

#### **Option D**: 
This option claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous. While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, the matrix \( A_y \) is typically represented in the standard basis, not the eigenbasis. Thus, this statement is not strictly correct.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the operators \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
