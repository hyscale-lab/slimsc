Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, it's about interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the crystal is rhombohedral with interatomic distance 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And they're asking for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, but I need to calculate it.

Wait, what's the formula for interplanar distance? Oh right, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )) ) or something like that. No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that in a cubic system, it's simpler because angles are 90 degrees, but here the angles are 30 each.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2 hk cos gamma)/(a²) + (2 hl cos beta)/(a²) + (2 kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, no, I think I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, I recall that in a rhombohedral system, all the a, b, c lattice parameters are equal (a = b = c), and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So perhaps the formula simplifies.

So for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance (d) for (hkl) planes is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos gamma) + 2(kl cos gamma) )

Wait, because alpha, beta, gamma are all the same, 30 degrees here.

So given a = 10 Angstroms, and the plane is (1 1 1). So h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging in the numbers: 

d = 10 / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1*1 * cos30) *3 )

Wait, wait. Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the cross terms: 2*(h k cos gamma) + 2*(h l cos gamma) + 2*(k l cos gamma)

Each of those terms is 2*(1*1 * cos30). Since gamma is 30 degrees, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So each cross term is 2 * (1 * 0.8660) = 1.732, but wait, wait, no. Wait, each cross term is 2*(h k cos gamma) etc. So for each pair:

For h and k: 2*(1*1 * cos30) = 2*(0.8660) ≈ 1.732
Same for h and l: another 1.732
Same for k and l: another 1.732
So total cross terms are 1.732 *3 = 5.196.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 (from squares) plus 5.196 (from cross terms) = 8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) 

What's sqrt(8.196)? Let's calculate. 8.196 is close to 9, because 9 is 3². Wait, sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864, because 2.864² is approx 8.196.

Wait, 2.86 squared: 2.86 *2.86. 2 *2 =4, 0.86*2.86 is about 2.45, so 2.86² is about 8.1796. Hmm, 2.86 squared is about 8.18. So 8.196 is a bit higher, so sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49. Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 or 10 Angstroms. Oh wait wait, no, wait a minute. Did I mess up the formula?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because in a rhombohedral system, all the vectors are same length a, but the angles are the same. So perhaps the formula is correct, but wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a?

Wait, no, wait. In a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. But in a crystal like a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', the lattice parameter. But in other structures, like hexagonal close-packed or others, the interatomic distance might be a function of the lattice parameters and angles.

Wait, wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Are a, b, c the lattice parameters, or is the interatomic distance a? I think in most cases, the interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure is the same as a. But in a rhombohedral system, especially if it's a primitive lattice, maybe the interatomic distance is different.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.

In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, because the atoms are at the corners of a cube. So the nearest neighbor distance is 'a√1' since it's along the cube edge. So for a simple cubic, a is the nearest neighbor distance.

But in a BCC structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√3/2, because atoms are along the diagonal of the cube face. Similarly, for FCC, it's a√2/2.

Wait, but wait, this is for cubic systems. Rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, I think, or is it a separate category? No, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system where all a, b, c are equal and angles are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is such that the unit cell is a rhombohedron, and the interatomic distance (say, for a primitive unit cell) is given in terms of the lattice parameters and angles.

Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this crystal, the nearest neighbor distance is 10. So I need to find a in terms of the interatomic distance.

But wait, maybe in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is a√(something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. But in that case, the calculation I did earlier gives d around 3.49, which is nowhere near the options. The options are all around 9 or 10, so I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait! Wait a second. Maybe the formula for d is different.

Wait, I think the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos gamma + 2 kl cos gamma )

But if the interatomic distance is not the same as a, then perhaps a is not 10. Wait, no, the question says interatomic distance is 10. So maybe a = 10 Angstroms. But then, as I calculated earlier, the d would be around 3.49, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another thought: maybe the interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms in a different way. For example, in a primitive rhombohedral lattice, the atomic positions are at the corners of the rhombohedron. So the nearest neighbor distance would be determined by the vectors.

Wait, in a primitive rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell has atoms only at the corners. So the nearest atoms are connected by vectors, and the distance between them is sqrt( a² + a² + a² - 2 a² (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) )? No, wait, perhaps the distance between two adjacent atoms is given by the length of the vector from one corner to another along an edge.

Wait, no, the edges are along the lattice vectors. So the distance between two adjacent atoms would be the magnitude of the lattice vectors. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c with angles between them. Wait, but in a primitive rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, and with angles alpha, beta, gamma. So the nearest neighbor distance would be the magnitude of the vector along any of these edges, which is a. So the interatomic distance is a.

Wait, but in that case, a is 10 Angstroms. Then why the interplanar distance d comes to 3.49, which is not matching any options.

Wait, but the options are much larger, around 10. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is 10, but the formula I used is not correct.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is about the lattice parameter 'a' being 10, and the interatomic distance is a different thing. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for interplanar distance. Let me try to recall.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ( \frac{1}{a^2} ) + (2 h k \cos \gamma) ( \frac{1}{a^2} ) + (2 h l \cos \beta) ( \frac{1}{a^2} ) + (2 k l \cos \alpha) ( \frac{1}{a^2} ) } }

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, the formula is:

d^2 = \frac{a^2 b^2 c^2}{(h^2 (b^2 c^2 \sin^2 alpha) + k^2 (a^2 c^2 sin^2 beta) + l^2 (a^2 b^2 sin^2 gamma) ) + ...}?

No, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is better expressed in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are equal (a = b = c), and all the angles are the same (alpha = beta = gamma = theta, say 30 degrees here).

The formula for interplanar distance in such a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta) )

But if I plug in h = k = l = 1, theta = 30 degrees, and a = 10 Angstroms, then the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1*0.866)*3). Wait, because cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, let's compute the denominator: 

h² + k² + l² = 3.

The cross terms: 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta) = 2*(1)(1)*0.866 *3.

So 2 * 0.866 *3 = 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstroms.

But looking at the options, the smallest option is about 8.95, so this doesn't match. So that can't be. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Ah! Wait a second. Maybe the interatomic distance isn't the lattice parameter a. Because in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at a corner, but the nearest neighbors might not be along the edges.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. But in a BCC, it's a√3/4, but wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, in a BCC structure, the atoms are at the corners and the centers of the cube. The nearest neighbors are along the face diagonals, so the distance would be a√2/2. Because the face diagonal is a√2, so half of that is a√2/2.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the situation is more complicated. The interatomic distance might not be simply a, especially if the structure is not simple cubic.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is different. Let me think about the unit cell.

In a rhombohedral unit cell, each corner has one atom, so it's a primitive unit cell. The number of atoms per unit cell is 1.

The nearest neighbors are determined by the vectors of the lattice. So the vectors are a, b, c, but the interatomic distance would be the minimal distance between any two atoms.

In a rhombohedral lattice with a at 10 A, and angles 30 degrees, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a*sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1)(1)cos(30) )^0.5? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, the vector connecting two atoms would be the sum of the lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps the minimal vector is a + b, but that depends on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as a. So if the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10.

But that led me to d=3.49, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm, another possibility: perhaps I should use the inverse of the formula or made a wrong substitution.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is a/(sqrt(...)), but in this case, if I get a small d, the reciprocal would be large. Wait, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the unit cell is not primitive. Wait, no, the question says rhombohedral, which is usually primitive. So each unit cell has one atom.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the ionic radius or something else, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look up the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal.

After some thinking, I remember that the correct formula is indeed:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos gamma + 2 kl cos gamma )

But wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the interatomic spacing as a, not the other way around. Let's see. Alternatively, perhaps a is not 10, but derived from the interatomic distance.

Wait, assuming the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a simple cubic is a, but in rhombohedral, perhaps it's different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is equal to the edge length a multiplied by sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1)(1) cos(theta) ), but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the minimal interatomic distance is given by the magnitude of the vector along the edge, which is a. So a is 10 A. Then, my calculation for d is 3.49, but that's not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/a².

Wait, but in this problem, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, so:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 ) / a²

So for (111):

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So numerator:

3 + 2*(1*1 * sqrt(3)/2)*3.

Wait, 2*(1*1 * cos30) is 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. So for each of the three terms (hk, hl, kl), it's 1.732 each. So 3*1.732 ≈5.196.

So total numerator is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / a².

a is 10 A, so a²=100.

1/d² = 8.196 /100 = 0.08196.

So d²=1/0.08196 ≈12.205.

So d≈ sqrt(12.205) ≈3.493 A.

But options are all around 9 A. So where's the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe d is a multiplied by sqrt(...), not a divided. No, no, the formula is d = a / sqrt(...). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is 10 A, but a is not 10. Maybe a is the interatomic distance multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps if the interatomic distance is 10 A, then a is the lattice parameter that is related to the interatomic distance. So I need to find a such that the interatomic distance is 10 A.

Wait, in a simple cubic lattice, a is the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral lattice, perhaps the interatomic distance is a * sqrt(something).

Wait, for a rhombohedral lattice with angles 30 degrees, what is the interatomic distance in terms of a?

The interatomic distance would be the shortest distance between any two adjacent atoms. In a rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell has atoms at each corner. So the shortest vector would be the edge vector, which has length a. So the interatomic distance would be a. So if the interatomic distance is 10 A, then a=10.

But that brings me back to d=3.49, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the rhombohedral lattice in question is not simple. Maybe it's a face-centered or body-centered rhombohedral. But I think rhombohedral is typically primitive, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula I'm using is for the interplanar distance in the reciprocal lattice? No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Miller indices differently. Wait, the question is about the (111) plane. So h, k, l are 1,1,1.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have cos(alpha), cos(beta), and cos(gamma) for each pair. But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so it's the same for all.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the cross terms.

Wait, for (hkl) = (111), the cross terms are:

2hk cos gamma = 2*(1)(1)*cos30 = 2*(1.732/2) = 1.732.

Wait, no, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So 2*1*1*0.866 = 1.732.

But how many cross terms are there? There are three cross terms: hk, hl, kl. So 3*(1.732) =5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt of that is about 2.863.

So d=10 /2.863≈3.493 A.

But again, the options are much larger. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using a different a. Maybe a is the interplanar parameter, or perhaps I have the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps I should invert a, meaning a is 10, but in the formula, it's a = interatomic distance. So perhaps a is 10, but the formula for d is 1/a times something.

Wait, no, the formula is d = a / sqrt(...), so a is in the numerator.

Wait, maybe I should consider the unit cell volume or something else, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is correct, but the problem refers to the (111) interplanar distance being much larger because of the angles. But that doesn't make sense because the angles are 30 degrees, which are acute, leading to smaller d.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Another resource I recall: in a cubic system, if the angles are 90 degrees, the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²).

For (111), d = a / sqrt(3). So if a is 10, d would be about 5.77, but that's not the case here.

But in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees, so the denominator becomes larger, making d smaller, which is what I found earlier.

Hmm, but the options are much larger. So perhaps the interatomic distance isn't a, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the diagonal of the unit cell. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms along the space diagonal. For a cube, space diagonal is a√3. So if a=10, the space diagonal is 17.32 A. But that's much larger than the options.

Wait, but in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees. So perhaps the unit cell vectors are arranged such that the interatomic distance is given by a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the lattice parameter a given that the interatomic distance is 10 A.

Wait, in a simple cubic system, a would be 10. But in rhombohedral, perhaps the interatomic distance is a * sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(something)).

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is given by the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system is not along the lattice vectors but a combination of them.

Wait, for a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between two atoms can be found by the vectors. The unit vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, with angles 30 degrees between them.

The nearest neighbor distance would be the minimal |h a + k b + l c|.

Assuming the structure is such that the nearest neighbor is along <100> or <010> etc., but perhaps the minimal vector is along (111) direction.

Wait, no, perhaps the minimal vector is (1,1,0), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal vector is (1,0,0), but in that case, the distance is a, which would be the interatomic distance.

So if the interatomic distance is 10 A, a is 10.

But earlier calculations give d=3.49, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interplanar distance using the reciprocal of a. So perhaps I inverted a.

Wait, but the formula is d = a / sqrt(...), so a is in the numerator. So if a is 10, then d is 3.49.

But the options are all around 9. So perhaps a is not 10.

Wait, so let me think inversely. If the interatomic distance is 10, then perhaps a is not 10. Let me find a such that the interatomic distance is 10.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction in the crystal. So the vector would be a*(1,1,1), so magnitude is a * sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2*(cos30 + cos30 + cos30))?

Wait, no. The magnitude of the vector a*(1,1,1) would be sqrt( (a)^2 (1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 )) ). Wait, no, that's not correct. The magnitude is sqrt( a² (1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 )) ) ?

Wait, no, wait, the magnitude of a*(h i + k j + l k) where the basis vectors are not orthogonal.

Wait, the magnitude squared is (a h)^2 + (a k)^2 + (a l)^2 + 2 a^2 h k cos gamma + 2 a^2 h l cos beta + 2 a^2 k l cos alpha.

So for the (111) direction, the squared magnitude is (a^2)(1+1+1 + 2*(1*1 cos30)*3 ) = a^2 (3 + 3*(1.732 / 2 * 2)).

Wait, cos30 is about 0.866.

So 3 + 3*( 2 * 0.866 ) = 3 + 3*(1.732) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So the magnitude is a * sqrt(8.196).

If the interatomic distance is 10 A, then a * sqrt(8.196) =10.

So a =10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 A.

Wait, but then the interplanar distance d for (111) would be a / sqrt( same terms as before ), which is 3.493 / sqrt(8.196) = 3.493 / 2.863 ≈1.22 A. But that's way off the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the interatomic distance and the lattice parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (100) direction, so the distance is a. So interatomic distance is a=10.

Then, the interplanar distance d would be 3.49, but again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, another formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )) )

So, for (111), with all angles 30 degrees:

d = a / sqrt(1+1+1 + 2*1*1*(3 terms of cos30))

So, 3 + 3*(2 cos30) =3 + 3*(2 *0.866) = 3 + 5.196 =8.196.

d = a / sqrt(8.196) = a / 2.863.

So if a=10, d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But options are all around 9. So perhaps a is not 10.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is a, so a=10. Then, d=3.49. Not matching.

But wait, maybe the question is not about a rhombohedral lattice but a different system. Wait, the question says 'rhombohedral crystal', so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the reciprocal of the interatomic distance.

Wait, if the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d instead of d. No, that would give 0.286, which is even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = ( ... ) / a², but in this case, I think it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the reciprocal of the interatomic distance. Let me see.

No, I think I'm stuck here. Let's think about the options.

The options are A:9.08, B:8.95, C:9.54, D:10.05.

These are all close to 9 or so. Let's see if I can find a that would make d around 9.08.

If d=9.08, then

9.08 = a / sqrt(8.196) → a =9.08 *2.863 ≈ 26.04.

So a would be 26 Angstroms. But the interatomic distance is given as 10, so if a=26, the interatomic distance (which is a) would be 26, which contradicts the given 10.

Wait, but earlier I thought the interatomic distance is a, but maybe it's not.

Alternative approach: calculate using the reciprocal.

Wait, maybe the formula should be d = a * sqrt(...), but that would make d larger, which may fit the options.

Wait, no, the formula is d =a / sqrt(...), so if the denominator is small, d is larger. But in our case, denominator is 2.863, so d=10/2.863=3.49.

Hmm. Oh! Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the formula, and the correct formula has the denominator as (h² +k² + l² - ...), but that would give a larger d.

Wait, perhaps I have the signs wrong.

Wait, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is:

d_{hkl}^2 = (a^2) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk (cos gamma) + 2 hl (cos beta) + 2 kl (cos alpha) )

Wait, but if the angles are 30 degrees, cos is positive, so denominator is bigger, making d smaller.

Wait, what if the formula is:

d_{hkl}^2 = (a^2) / ( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 hk (cos gamma) - 2 hl (cos beta) - 2 kl (cos alpha) )

Then, with angles 30 degrees, the denominator would be 3 - 5.196 = negative, which is impossible.

So that can't be.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula uses the unit cell volume.

Wait, the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma).

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would help with interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reciprocal of d is related to the Miller indices and the structure factor, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h = (2pi/a) (1, 1, 1) 

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the formula using the reciprocal lattice is:

d = 2pi / | (h a^* + k b^* + l c^*) | 

But I'm not familiar enough with that approach.

At this point, I think I've tried all possible avenues, but the calculation leads me to a d of about 3.49, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 hk cos gamma + ... )^-1.

Wait, which is the same as what I did before. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, which is unlikely, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interplanar distance in the reciprocal lattice?

Wait, no, the question is about the real-space interplanar distance.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have used the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma).

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the atomic radius.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is 2r, where r is the atomic radius. But how does that relate to the lattice parameter a? That varies with structure.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, a = 2r.

In a BCC, the relation is a√3/4 = r.

In FCC, a√2/4 = r.

But for a rhombohedral structure, I'm not sure about the relation. But in any case, without knowing the structure type beyond rhombohedral, I can't proceed.

So, perhaps I should give up and see which option makes sense.

Wait, if a=10, then d=3.49, not matching.

If a=9.08, the option A is 9.08. Let's compute.

If a=9.08:

d=9.08 / sqrt(8.196) ≈9.08/2.863≈3.17.

Nope, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula.

If d is given as one of the options and I'm to find a.

Wait, but the question gives the interatomic distance, not d.

Hmm. I think I've hit a dead end. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that a=10. Maybe the interatomic distance is not a, but a multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is given by a * sqrt( ... ), and I should compute a accordingly.

Wait, let's say the interatomic distance is 10 A.

The vector for nearest neighbor is (1,1,1), so the magnitude is a * sqrt(3 + 2*(cos30 + cos30 + cos30)).

Wait, cos30 is ~0.866.

So 3 + 2*(0.866 *3) = 3 + 5.196= 8.196.

So magnitude = a * sqrt(8.196) =10.

So a=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈3.493 A.

Now, the interplanar distance d is a / sqrt( ... ), which in this case is 3.493 / sqrt(8.196) ≈ 3.493 / 2.863 ≈1.22 A.

But that's still not matching. So I think I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the distance in reciprocal space. Or perhaps it's a typo and meant to be a cubic system.

If it were a cubic system with a=10, then d=10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 A, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - 2*(hk cos gamma + ... ) /a².

But then for (111):

1/d² = (3 - 5.196)/100 = (-2.196)/100 → negative, which is impossible.

So no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Miller indices differently. Perhaps the problem refers to a different plane.

Wait, the question is about (111) plane, so I think I'm correct with h=1, k=1, l=1.

Another thought: perhaps the formula uses 2pi instead of 1, but that would be for the reciprocal lattice, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + ... ), but that would make d much larger, but let's see.

Wait, no, the formula is d = a / sqrt(...), which makes d smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the volume of the unit cell.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the volume and relate it to the interatomic distance.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the possible d from the options and see what a would be.

For option A: d=9.08.

Using d = a / sqrt(8.196).

So a=9.08 * 2.863≈25.99 A.

But then, the interatomic distance would be something else, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is wrong, and I should use the inverse.

Wait, if I use a=10, and d=3.49, but the options are around 9, that's 10/3.49≈2.86. So perhaps I should take the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, that would mean d=10 * sqrt(8.196) ≈10 * 2.863≈28.63, which is way larger than options.

No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and it's 1/d = ... ?

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula elsewhere.

After checking, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is indeed:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

Given that, and all angles are 30 degrees, and (111) plane, then:

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 3*(2 * cos30)).

Wait, wait, no. Each cross term is 2 hk cos gamma.

So 2*(1)(1)*0.866 *3 terms → 3*(1.732) ≈5.196.

So 3+5.196=8.196 → sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.493.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt(...), which would make it around 28.63. No, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the distance between two planes, which is d, but perhaps the given interatomic distance is in a different direction.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms.

Wait, perhaps the cross terms are 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma.

In our case, hk + hl + kl =3.

So 2*3 cos30= 5.196.

So the denominator is 3 +5.196=8.196. So same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct calculation leads to d≈3.49 Angstroms, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that a=10. Maybe the interatomic distance is not a, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between the centers of the spheres in the face-centered positions. No, but the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms in the same face diagonal or something else.

Wait, perhaps the rhombohedral system is such that the interatomic distance is the face diagonal.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, the face diagonal would be sqrt(a² + a² + 2a² cos alpha), but the angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, for a face diagonal, the length would be sqrt( a² + a² + 2a² cos alpha ) → a*sqrt(2 + 2 cos alpha).

With alpha=30 degrees, cos30=0.866.

So length is a*sqrt(2 + 2*0.866) =a*sqrt(2+1.732) =a*sqrt(3.732) ≈a *1.932.

If the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10/1.932≈5.175 A.

Then, the interplanar distance d would be a / sqrt(8.196) =5.175 /2.863≈1.807 A.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the space diagonal. So the space diagonal would be sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) ) =a*sqrt(3 + 3*0.866) =a*sqrt(3 +2.598)=a*sqrt(5.598)=a*2.366.

So if interatomic distance is 10, a=10/2.366≈4.225 A.

Then, d=4.225 /2.863≈1.475 A.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. After trying multiple approaches, I can't find a way to get an interplanar distance close to the options given. Perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of 8.196.

1/8.196≈0.122.

Wait, but that's not useful.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for d is sqrt( (a^2)/(h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha) ) ), which would give d= sqrt(100/8.196) ≈sqrt(12.205)=3.49, same as before.

Thus, I'm confident that my calculation is correct, but the given options don't include it. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest would be option B:8.95, but that's not close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of cos30 degrees. Perhaps it's sin30? No, cos30 is about 0.866, and sin30 is 0.5.

Wait, if I mistakenly used sin30 instead of cos30, then:

Denominator would be 3 + 3*(2*0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 A.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sine instead of the cosine. Let me see.

If I use sin30=0.5, then cross terms are 2*(1)(1)*0.5 *3 =3.

So denominator:3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082.

No, that's not matching either.

But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the hexagonal formula. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a different crystal system.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's a hexagonal system instead. For a hexagonal system, the formula is different.

Wait, in a hexagonal system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 h k cos theta + 2 h l cos theta + 2 k l cos theta )

Wait, no, hexagonal is different. In hexagonal, the formula is:

d^2 = (4/3) a^2 (h² + k² + hk) / ( (h² +k² + l²) + hk + hl + kl )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, the correct formula for hexagonal is more involved, but perhaps for (111) it's different.

But the question is about rhombohedral, not hexagonal.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the formula, but I can't figure it out. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach or consider that the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options don't include my calculated value, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is computed using the reciprocal of a.

Wait, if a=10, then 1/a=0.1, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d = something, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the angles are 30 degrees, but I'm using the wrong trigonometric function.

Wait, perhaps I should use 180-30=150 degrees for some reason, but that would make cos(150)=-0.866.

Wait, that would change the cross terms to negative.

So denominator would be 3 +3*(-0.866)*2=3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative, impossible.

So that can't be.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. After all this, I think the correct answer based on the formula is approximately 3.49 A, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct approach leads to one of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inverse of the denominator.

Wait, if d = a * sqrt(... ), then for a=10, sqrt(8.196)=2.863, so d=28.63 A, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( ... ), which would make d=10 * 2.863=28.63, which is way larger than options.

No.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * (h² +k² +l² + ... )^(-1/2).

Which would give the same as before.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with my initial calculation despite the options not matching. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Because perhaps for rhombohedral, the formula uses subtraction instead of addition for the cross terms. Let's try that.

So for theta=30, cos(theta)=0.866.

Denominator:3 - 2*(1+1+1)*0.866 =3 - 3*1.732=3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so it's impossible. So that can't be the case.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral because of the specific angles.

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

In a hexagonal system, the formula is more complicated.

But in a rhombohedral, all edges are a, and angles are theta.

So the correct formula is what I used earlier.

Thus, I think the correct answer is approximately 3.49 A, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the cross terms. Let me recount.

Each cross term is 2 hk cos(theta).

For (111), there are three cross terms: hk, hl, kl. Each is 2*(1)(1)*0.866=1.732.

So 3*1.732=5.196.

So denominator is 3+5.196=8.196.

Yes, correct.

So, I conclude that the correct answer is approximately 3.49 A, but since it's not in the options, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But the options don't include it.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let's try that.

cos60=0.5.

Denominator:3 +3*(2*0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08, still not matching.

Alternatively, if the angles are 60 degrees, but that's not the case here.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) + ... but I think I've done that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 2*(hk + hl + kl) instead of 2hk cos gamma etc.

But that would change the cross terms to 2*(3) =6.

Denominator:3+6=9.

d=10/3≈3.333. Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and have to conclude that none of the options match the calculation. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C:9.54.

Wait, let me check.

If d=9.54, then a= d * sqrt(8.196) →9.54 *2.863≈27.36.

But the interatomic distance is given as 10, which would imply a=27.36, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1/d)^2 using the formula.

Wait, no, I think I've tried everything. So perhaps the answer is option A:9.08.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:8.95.

But without further information, I can't determine. I think I've reached the limit of my understanding.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos\gamma + 2hl \cos\beta + 2kl \cos\alpha}}
\]

### Given:
- Interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- Angles: \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- Miller indices: \( h = k = l = 1 \)

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
1. **Sum of squares**:  
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]

2. **Cross terms**:  
   Each cross term is \( 2hk \cos\gamma \), \( 2hl \cos\beta \), or \( 2kl \cos\alpha \).  
   Since \( \cos(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \):  
   \[
   2hk \cos\gamma = 2(1)(1)(0.866) = 1.732
   \]  
   Similarly, \( 2hl \cos\beta = 1.732 \) and \( 2kl \cos\alpha = 1.732 \).  
   Total cross terms:  
   \[
   1.732 \times 3 = 5.196
   \]

3. **Denominator**:  
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos\gamma + 2hl \cos\beta + 2kl \cos\alpha = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
   \]

4. **Square root of denominator**:  
   \[
   \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

### Step 2: Compute \( d_{hkl} \)
\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{8.196}} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options (\( 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)). This suggests either an issue with the interpretation of the interatomic distance or a mismatch in the formula. However, based on the given options, the closest plausible answer is **A: 9.08 Å**, though this does not align with the derived calculation.

### Conclusion
The interplanar distance calculation yields \( d_{hkl} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), but since this is not among the options, the most reasonable choice from the given list is:

**Answer: A**
