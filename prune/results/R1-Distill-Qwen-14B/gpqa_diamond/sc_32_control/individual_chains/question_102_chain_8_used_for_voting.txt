Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up in the mice. Let me unpack this step by step.

First, the question describes a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means two genes in one vector. So here, the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Both have stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 respectively.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element, which I believe allows internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed as a separate transcript. So the vector should produce two proteins: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

They used loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. Wait, the ligand is at 5' with a loxP-stop in front, so if Cre is present, it would remove that stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed, right? Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272 stop cassette. So the IRES would drive the receptor's expression, but only if the lox2272 stop is removed.

In the experiment, they transfected this into primary astrocytes and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. On Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin, so the proteins are being expressed. So the construct is working in vitro.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells. Cre would be expressed under the SOX10 promoter, meaning Cre is active in neural crest-derived cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. They expected green (eGFP) but didn't see it. So why no eGFP?

Let me think about the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about the expression in the same cell? Or in different cells? I'm not sure how this relates to eGFP expression. Maybe if the ligand and receptor are expressed in different cells, but how does that affect the construct? The construct itself is about expression, not interaction. So maybe not the reason for no eGFP.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The receptor is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't be visible. But why in the mouse? Since the construct works in vitro, maybe the mouse cells handle it differently. But I'm not certain. Also, the question says the vector uses IRES, which is often used for expression in the same cell.

Option C: Enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe expression isn't happening. Wait, but in astrocytes, they saw expression. So the promoters are working. Unless, in the mouse, certain tissues aren't expressing because an enhancer is missing. But the question says the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is for neural crest. Maybe the construct isn't expressed in the right tissues because the promoter isn't active there. Hmm.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Wait, the eGFP is fused to the receptor's C-terminus. If the stop cassette is lox2272, which is a different site from loxP, then when Cre is expressed, the lox2272 site would be recognized. In the vector, the ligand is under CBA, then a stop with loxP. The receptor is after IRES, then stop with lox2272. So when Cre is expressed (like in the neural crest cells due to SOX10-Cre), the Cre would act on their respective sites.

So in the presence of Cre:

- The ligand's loxP-stop is excised, so ligand-mCherry is expressed.

- The receptor's lox2272-stop is excised, so receptor-eGFP is expressed.

Wait, but the vector is designed such that the first gene (ligand) is under CBA, and the second (receptor) is under IRES. But when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is at 5', followed by a stop with loxP. After that, the receptor's ORF is there, preceded by an IRES, and followed by a stop with lox2272.

So when Cre is present, in the same cell, the two stops are excised, and both ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, so actually, the Cre would excise the stops, allowing each gene to be expressed. So in the mice, which are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stops in the neural crest cells, leading to both ligand and receptor expression.

But why no green signal (eGFP)?

Maybe the construct isn't correctly excising. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF at 5' with mCherry, and the receptor at 3' with eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed. So the receptor would be expressed as a separate transcript because it's after the IRES.

Wait, no. The vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning the two ORFs are in the same mRNA. The first ORF (ligand) is under CBA, and the second (receptor) is under the control of an IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the stops would prevent the downstream ORFs from being expressed. But when Cre is present, the stops are excised, so both are expressed.

Wait, but in the case of the mouse, the construct is homozygous. So each allele has the ligand and receptor. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, Cre is expressed in neural crest cells.

So the ligand and receptor should be expressed in the same cells. So why no eGFP?

Looking at the options again:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, no, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, when Cre is present, it would remove the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed as part of the receptor construct.

But if the eGFP is not in frame after the receptor, perhaps the fusion protein is not made correctly. Wait, the question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So in the vector, the receptor is followed by eGFP after a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

Wait, perhaps when the lox2272 stop is removed, only the receptor is expressed, but not eGFP because the eGFP is in a separate frame. No, wait, the construct is designed as receptor-eGFP. So the eGFP is under the same ORF as the receptor, but after a stop with lox2272.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure again.

The vector is bicistronic:

5' -- CBA promoter -- ligand ORF -- stop with loxP -- IRES -- receptor ORF -- stop with lox2272 -- 3'

So the ligand is on the same transcript as the receptor, but the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF. But the stops prevent the downstream ORFs from being expressed unless Cre is present.

Wait, no. In a bicistronic construct, the two ORFs are in the same transcript. The first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter. The second ORF (receptor) is after an IRES. So for the second ORF to be expressed, the ribosome can translate it via the IRES without the need for a promoter.

But the stops are in front of each ORF. The ligand ORF is followed by a stop with loxP. So without Cre, the stop is in place, so the ligand is expressed only up to that point. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop with lox2272.

But in this setup, when Cre is present, it removes the loxP from the ligand's stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed. For the receptor, the IRES allows its own translation, but the lox2272 stop is in place unless Cre is there to remove it.

Wait, no. I think the presence of Cre would remove the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing both the ligand and the receptor to be expressed. But wait, actually, the lox2272 is a different recombinase site. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recognized, and the lox2272 sites are also recognized because they are also Cre sites.

Wait, but I thought that lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but has a different recombination outcome. So in this vector, both the ligand's stop and the receptor's stop are flanked by lox sites that Cre can act on.

So when Cre is present, both stops are excised, allowing both ORFs to be expressed. So the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't showing up. So perhaps the eGFP is not being translated correctly. Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, no, the eGFP is fused to the receptor. So if the ORF is broken, perhaps because the frame is wrong after the stop is removed.

Wait, but the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So after Cre removes the stop, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF. So if the reading frame is correct, the eGFP will be expressed as a fusion protein.

But what if the frame is wrong? For example, if the stop is removed, but the next codon starts in a different frame, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional eGFP. Or perhaps the eGFP is inserted in a different frame.

Wait, the question says the receptor is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. So if the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, which is before the eGFP, then when the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP is expressed as a single ORF.

But if the eGFP is in a different frame, then the fusion protein wouldn't be made. So that's option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in a way that when removed, the frame shifts. Let me think: the stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So if the stop is after the receptor, and before eGFP, then when the stop is removed, the receptor is followed directly by eGFP. But if the stop was in a frame that, when removed, causes a frameshift, then the eGFP would not be correctly expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the eGFP as a separate ORF after the receptor, but in a different frame. But the question says the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, so it's a single ORF.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the construct again.

The construct is:

Ligand ORF (CBA-driven) -> Stop cassette (loxP) -> IRES -> Receptor ORF -> Stop cassette (lox2272) -> eGFP?

Wait, no. The question says the ligand is at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at 3' fused to eGFP. So perhaps the structure is:

Ligand-mCherry is one construct, and receptor-eGFP is another, but in the same bicistronic vector.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed such that the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed, but each pair as separate cassettes.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has two separate ORFs, each with their own expression cassettes. But the question says it's a bicistronic vector, so they're in the same mRNA.

Wait, maybe the vector is set up such that the ligand is on the first ORF, followed by a stop, then the receptor as the second ORF after IRES, followed by another stop. So when Cre is present, both stops are removed, allowing both ORFs to be expressed.

But when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. So why?

In the Western blot, in vitro, both proteins are expressed. So the problem must be in the mouse model.

Possible issues:

1. The expression in the mouse isn't happening because the promoter isn't active.

But question says they're using SOX10-Cre, which is for neural crest. If the construct isn't expressed in neural crest, maybe because the CBA promoter isn't active there, but that would affect the ligand expression, but in the question, the issue is with the receptor-eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working in the mouse's cells, but again, in vitro it worked.

2. The construct isn't getting correctly recombined in the mouse.

Wait, in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-driven, which is active in neural crest cells. So the stops should be excised.

But perhaps the Cre isn't active, so the stops remain, and the receptor isn't expressed. But then why would the ligand be expressed? The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so it should be expressed regardless of Cre.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop with loxP. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. But in the mouse, when Cre is present, both should be expressed.

But the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so each allele has the ligand and receptor. They crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous. So in the offspring, some cells express Cre (from SOX10-Cre), leading to recombination.

But if the mouse's Cre isn't active, then the stops wouldn't be excised, and the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the question states that they're using SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest cells.

Wait, another thought: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the presence of Cre in the cells is required to remove the stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. If the stops aren't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But since in the mouse, the Cre is only in certain cells (neural crest), perhaps the construct is not recombined in those cells, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says they crossed the homozygous construct with SOX10-Cre mice. So the offspring should have Cre expression in neural crest cells, leading to the stops being excised.

Hmm...

Looking back at the options, which one would cause the eGFP not to show up.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So when the stop is removed, the reading frame is wrong, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP. But in the Western blot, the proteins are present. Wait, but if the frame is wrong, eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop would be in a different frame. Alternatively, the fusion protein might not be made correctly.

Wait, perhaps the stop was in a frame that, when removed, the reading frame shifts, making the eGFP not properly expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so the ORF after the stop is removed would lead to a frameshift, causing eGFP not to be translated, hence no green signal.

So which option aligns with that?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean when the stop is removed, the reading frame is incorrect, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF, but the construct isn't designed correctly.

I think the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So when Cre removes the stop, the frame is wrong, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites are present upstream of mCherry and eGFP, respectively. When Cre recombinase is expressed, it excises these stop cassettes, enabling expression of the ligand and receptor. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of eGFP, not the functional interaction between ligand and receptor. Since the issue is with eGFP expression, this option does not explain the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, and eGFP would not be visible. However, the construct works in vitro, and there is no evidence suggesting a defect in trafficking in the mouse model. This makes this option less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and an IRES for the receptor, both of which are functional in vitro. The absence of an enhancer in the construct would not explain why eGFP specifically is not expressed. Additionally, the SOX10-Cre system should drive expression in neural crest cells, making this option unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, and the stop cassette upstream of eGFP is flanked by lox2272 sites. When Cre excises the stop cassette, the receptor and eGFP should be co-expressed in the same ORF. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, the removal of the stop cassette could result in a frameshift, preventing proper translation of eGFP. This would explain the absence of the green signal, making this the most likely explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the correct reading frame, which prevents proper translation of eGFP after the stop cassette is excised by Cre recombinase.
