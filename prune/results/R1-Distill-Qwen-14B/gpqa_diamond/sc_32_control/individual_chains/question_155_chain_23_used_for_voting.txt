Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, which is denoted as ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩². So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then use those to find the uncertainty.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. Oh wait, wait, the elements of the vector are (-1/2, 1/sqrt{2}, -1/2). So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

But wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That makes sense because the matrix for P_z is diagonal in this basis. So when calculating expectation values, I can directly use this state.

So first, I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in the state |ψ>. The matrix for P_z is given. Let me write it out:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

Since it's diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of (each component of |ψ> squared multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element).

So let's compute each term:

The state is |ψ> = [a, b, c]^T where a = -1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = a^2 * (ħ) + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-ħ).

Calculating each part:

a^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by ħ: (1/4) ħ.
b^2 = (1/2), because (1/sqrt(2)) squared is 1/2. But the middle term is zero, so that's 0.
c^2 = same as a^2, 1/4. Multiply by (-ħ): - (1/4) ħ.

So adding them up: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That might make things easier.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z² will be:

Row 1: [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ] → [ ħ², 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, (−ħ)^2 ] → [ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is again the sum of each component squared times the squared diagonal elements.

So:

a² * (ħ²) + b² * 0 + c² * (ħ²)

Which is:

(1/4) ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ²

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ). Plugging in the numbers:

⟨P_z⟩ is 0, so (⟨P_z⟩)^2 is 0. So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), so that would be the answer. Alternatively, sometimes they rationalize the denominator, which would be (sqrt(2)/2) ħ, but same thing.

Let me double-check the calculations just to be sure.

Calculating ⟨P_z⟩:
a² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ħ = ħ/4.
c² = same as a², so 1/4 * (-ħ) = - ħ/4.
Adding gives 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩:
a² * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².
c² * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².
Total is 1/4 +1/4 = 1/2. So (1/2) ħ².

So sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * (1/√2) = ħ/√2.

Yes, that seems right. So the uncertainty is ħ divided by square root of 2. So option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as a column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z)_{ii} \psi_i,
\]

where $\psi_i$ are the components of $|\psi\rangle$. Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed similarly:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z^2)_{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
