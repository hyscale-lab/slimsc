Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a 2x2 matrix because it's for a qubit.

Let me write down the matrices for |0> and |1>. The |0> state is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1> is [0; 1], so |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these two gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplied by 1/2, ρ becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm trying to recall how density matrices are represented geometrically. I think qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For pure states, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, which would be a vector pointing from the origin to the surface of the Bloch sphere. But this is a mixed state because it's a convex combination of |0> and |1>, right?

Wait, the Bloch sphere representation for mixed states is different. I remember that the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector. So r would be (x, y, z), and each component corresponds to the expectation values in the respective Pauli basis.

So for the given ρ, let's compute it. Our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute the matrix again. |0><0| is diagonal [1,0,0,0] as a 2x2, |1><1| is [0,0,0,1]. Adding them gives [1,0,0,1], divided by 2, so [0.5, 0, 0, 0.5].

Wait, in matrix form, that's [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. Now, using the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. I is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]] because (I/2) is 0.5 times identity matrix.

Wait, I need to find r such that (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 equals the given ρ.

Compute each Pauli matrix:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So I + r·σ is [[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]]

Then, (I + r·σ)/2 is [[(1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2], [(r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2]]

We know this should equal ρ, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]

So let's set up the equations. The diagonal elements must match.

For (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 must also be 0.5 → same result, r_z =0.

Now the off-diagonal terms: (r_x - i r_y)/2 =0 → r_x - i r_y =0.

Which implies that r_x =0 and r_y=0.

So putting it all together, r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait a second. The state (|0> + |1>)/√2 is a pure state on the equator of the Bloch sphere. But in our case, the density matrix is a mixed state where each state is equally probable. Because ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is a completely mixed state, like a classical coin with 50% heads and 50% tails.

In this case, the Bloch vector is zero because the state has no coherence and equal probabilities. So the geometric position is at the origin. Looking back at the options:

Option C is (0,0,0), which matches. So the correct answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For mixed states, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Expanding \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) \), we find:

\[
I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z.
\]

Substituting the Pauli matrices, we compute:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & -r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus,

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \), we equate the matrix elements:

1. From the diagonal elements: \( \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = 0.5 \) and \( \frac{1 - r_z}{2} = 0.5 \), which implies \( r_z = 0 \).
2. From the off-diagonal elements: \( \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \) and \( \frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} = 0 \), which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in qubit space. This represents a completely mixed state with no coherence or preference for any direction.

The correct answer is:
