Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. The state vector is provided, and I need to calculate ΔP_z.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). That part I think I got right.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but wait. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state we're given is already in the P_z eigenbasis. Oh, that's useful because in that case, the expectation value of P_z is just the eigenvalue corresponding to the state.

Wait, no, is the state an eigenvector of P_z? No, the state is an eigenstate of P_x. Because the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So we're in a superposition of P_z eigenstates.

Right, so the state is a linear combination of the P_z eigenstates. So to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, I need to calculate the expectation values using the given state.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component in the state vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Let me look at the P_z matrix given. The P_z matrix is diagonal because it's given as:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

Wait, no, wait—the matrix form for P_z is:

Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the eigenvalues (diagonal entries) are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the basis vectors are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, corresponding to P_z eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

The given state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So ψ is a combination of these basis vectors.

In the P_z basis, the state ψ is written as a linear combination: ψ = c₁|1⟩ + c₂|2⟩ + c₃|3⟩, where c₁ = -1/2, c₂=1/√2, c₃= -1/2.

But wait, I should check if the state is normalized. Let me compute the sum of squares of the components: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's normalized. Good.

Now, the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, is the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |c₁|^2 * (ħ) + |c₂|^2 * 0 + |c₃|^2 * (-ħ).

Let me compute each term:

|c₁|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ħ.

|c₂|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. But since the eigenvalue is zero, this term is zero.

|c₃|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding them up: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

What about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z squared is just the square of each eigenvalue. Because P_z is diagonal, P_z² is also diagonal with entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So eigenvalues for P_z² are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = |c₁|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |c₂|^2 *0 + |c₃|^2 * (ħ)^2.

|c₁|^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)ħ².

|c₂|^2 = 1/2 → 0.

|c₃|^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)ħ².

Adding them: 1/4 ħ² + 1/4 ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ) → sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2) ) → this is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but in this case, since we've expressed it in the P_z basis, the expectation value comes out as zero. Hmm, does that make sense?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation values using the matrices. Wait, because the given state is in the P_z basis, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ directly.

Wait, P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ].

So when you compute ⟨ψ | P_z | ψ ⟩, it's sum over i |ψ_i|^2 * P_z_ii.

Which is exactly what I did before.

Same for P_z squared: it's sum |ψ_i|^2 * (P_z_ii)^2.

So yeah, the calculation seems correct.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state $\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$, which is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix:

\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
