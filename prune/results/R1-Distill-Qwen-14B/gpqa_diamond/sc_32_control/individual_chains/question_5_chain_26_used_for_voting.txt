Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me see. The operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, wait. The operator isn't given directly; instead, its components P_x, P_y, and P_z are. So the operator P is probably the angular momentum operator, right? Because I remember that spin operators are often denoted as such. Oh wait, yes, in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator is usually represented by components like this.

So, the spin operator components are given. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which makes me think about spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. The muon here is just the particle in question, doesn't change the math much.

The direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is something like (cosθ, 0, sinθ), since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Theta here must be the angle from the z-axis, right? So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, where P is the operator along n.

Wait, the operator P along an arbitrary direction can be written as the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction unit vector n. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So the operator we're interested in is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Oh wait, n_z is the z-component of the direction vector. So n_z is sinθ, since n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the z-axis. Wait no, wait: usually, if θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, then the coordinates would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) or something. Hmm, wait, I might be mixing spherical coordinates. Let me think. Oh right, in spherical coordinates, the position vector is (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). So for a unit vector, it's (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ is zero. Because in x-z plane, the angle φ is zero or 180, depending on direction. So φ=0, so cosφ=1, sinφ=0. So the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. If the vector is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So the x component is sinθ cosφ, and z is cosθ. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So the direction vector is (sinθ * 1, 0, cosθ). So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So P = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Now, the operator P is given by this combination. So to find the eigenvector, I need to solve (P - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me write down each component of P_x, P_y, P_z multiplied by their terms.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So P_x = (ħ/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. That's σ_y multiplied by (ħ/2).

P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σ_z multiplied by (ħ/2).

So when we express P, it's (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Substituting the values:

P = sinθ * (ħ/2 σ_x) + cosθ * (ħ/2 σ_z)

Factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ]

So the matrix form of P is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]. Wait, let's compute that. 

The σ_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:

sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0 ]]

cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P is this matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator matrix is:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> .

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So it's:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So substituting P:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, so we get:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ] |ψ> = 0

Wait, no, perhaps I should subtract the eigenvalue from the diagonal. Let me think. The standard eigenvalue equation is (M - λ I) v = 0, where M is the matrix. So in this case, M is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] and λ is 1, because (since we've factored out ħ/2, the equation is [M] v = v, which is [M - I] v =0.

So M - I is [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the matrix becomes:

| cosθ -1      sinθ      |
| sinθ        -cosθ-1 |

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix. So the determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute the determinant:

( cosθ -1 ) ( -cosθ -1 ) - ( sinθ )^2 = 0

Let me compute that:

Multiply out the first term:

( cosθ -1 ) ( -cosθ -1 ) = [ -cos^2θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1 ] = [ -cos²θ + 1 ].

Because expanding:

= cosθ*(-cosθ) + cosθ*(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*1

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1

= -cos²θ + 1.

So the determinant is ( -cos²θ + 1 ) - sin²θ = 0.

But -cos²θ +1 is sin²θ, so sin²θ - sin²θ =0. So yes, the determinant is zero, as expected for eigenvalues.

So the system is consistent, and we can find non-trivial solutions.

The equations are:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 =0

sinθ v1 + ( -cosθ -1 ) v2 =0

So from the first equation:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 =0 → v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] v2.

Wait, but cosθ -1 is negative of 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). Hmm, perhaps we can simplify.

Alternatively, let me factor out:

v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] v2

But cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

v1 = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels:

= [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin²(theta/2) ) ] v2

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] v2

= cot(theta/2) v2

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ v1, v2 ]^T = [ cot(theta/2) v2, v2 ]^T.

So we can set v2 = 1 (for simplicity), then v1 = cot(theta/2).

But wait, wait. Wait, because when theta is 0, we're along the z-axis. So for theta=0, cot(theta/2) is cot(0) which is infinite. That makes sense because along the z-axis, the eigenvector should be along z, which is (1,0) or (0,1). Hmm, but in that case, I think when theta approaches 0, it's better to approach the limit.

Wait, perhaps I should parameterize it differently. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps to write the eigenvector in terms of theta.

Alternatively, let me express the eigenvector as ( v1, 1 ), since v2=1, then v1 = cot(theta/2).

But we can also write the eigenvector in terms of sine and cosine of theta/2.

Because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So v1 = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, because if v1 = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), then [v1, 1]^T is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]^T. Multiply numerator and denominator by sin(theta/2) to get [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So the eigenvector is proportional to ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Wait, but wait: [v1, v2] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because v1/sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2), which is as we found earlier.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. But wait, wait, let's check this.

Wait, in the equations, when I set v2=1, v1 becomes cot(theta/2). So the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T. To make this into [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], let's see:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sin(theta/2), but that would involve scaling. Alternatively, maybe we can express the vector as:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, perhaps I need to normalize this vector. Because the eigenvector given in the options has square roots and hbar, so we need to consider normalization.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we have here, but without any hbar scaling. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but the options have other elements, like sqrt(2/3) hbar and so on. So why are those options present? Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the operator P is (n · P), which is (sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z). But the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

( sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

But P_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, same for P_z. So when you combine them, the eigenvalues would vary based on the direction.

Wait, but when I wrote the matrix earlier, I think I considered the correct approach, leading to the eigenvector proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have. But wait, none of the other options match this exactly, except option C.

Wait, but the question says the eigenvector is normalized. So the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is already normalized, because cos² + sin² = 1.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So option C is the normalized eigenvector.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches exactly. So that would be the answer. But wait, why are there other options with hbar?

Ah, perhaps the problem considers the components to include hbar, but that doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So the options are the components of the eigenvector, which are dimensionless. So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the question says, "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the elements are just the components, which are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), as in option C.

Wait, but another option is D, which includes sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc. So why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of n. Because maybe the direction vector is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), which would mean n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Let me double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, earlier I thought that the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But perhaps I got that wrong. Let me clarify.

In spherical coordinates, the position vector is (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). So for a direction in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So earlier steps are correct. So the operator is P = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

So the matrix M is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Which, when solving, gives the eigenvector proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So yes, the correct option is C.

To calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Operator Setup**: The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$, where $\vec{n}$ is the unit vector along the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be written as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Thus, $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

2. **Matrix Representation**: The components of $\vec{P}$ are given:
   - $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),
   - $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Y matrix),
   - $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).

   Substituting $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, we get:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
   \]
   Simplifying, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is $\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle$. Factoring out $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation reduces to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Subtracting the identity matrix, the system becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Solving for Eigenvector**: From the first equation, $(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0$, we solve for $v_1$:
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1} v_2.
   \]
   Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
   \[
   v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2.
   \]
   Setting $v_2 = 1$ for simplicity, the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Normalization**: The vector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$ is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

6. **Comparison with Options**: Among the given options, only **Option C** matches the normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
