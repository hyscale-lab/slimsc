Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere, the Boltzmann equation is involved. The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor explains the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Since the problem says the energy difference is given, I think we can ignore the statistical weights (g factors) for now because the ratio is about the excitation levels, and it's given that star_1 is twice as excited. So, the ratio n1_upper/n1_lower would be twice that of n2_upper/n2_lower. 

So, let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2. And each R is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Wait, but wait, I think for each star, the same energy levels are considered, so g factors are the same for both stars. So R1/R2 would be (exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)))/(exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))) ) because the g's cancel out.

But wait, R1 is twice R2, so R1 = 2 R2. So substituting R1 and R2 expressions:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = 2.

Alternatively, exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that. So the left side is ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1)) ) ] = ln(2).

But wait, is the exponent correct? Because when I have exp(a/b) divided by exp(c/d), it's exp( (a/b) - (c/d) ). So in this case, the numerator is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), the denominator is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), so the ratio is exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ), which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ). So yes, that's correct.

So, let me rearrange this equation:

ΔE/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Alternatively, that's (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, let me see: [1/T2 -1/T1] = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Oh right, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting back, (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but the question is about the equation relating T1 and T2, so the specific value of ΔE might not be necessary unless the options involve those constants. The options don't have numerical factors, so perhaps we can proceed by rearranging the equation.

Wait, but let me check again. The equation is:

(ΔE / k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, that's the same as ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, wait, maybe I should have considered the ratio R1 = 2 R2, where R is the excitation ratio.

Wait, R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 similarly. So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ). Since R1 = 2 R2, then R1/R2 = 2. So:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking ln of both sides:

(ΔE/(k)) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

So [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE.

But the question is about which equation correctly relates T1 and T2, assuming LTE. So looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but in our equation, [ (T1 - T2) ]/(T1 T2) ) is multiplied by (ΔE/k) and equals ln(2). So the equation is (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm supposed to manipulate the equation without considering the constants, but that doesn't make sense because the options don't include them. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the problem.

Wait, another approach: The Boltzmann factor is for the ratio of the populations. So, for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)). So, the ratio for star1 is 2 times that of star2.

So, (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Since the energy levels are the same, the g factors probably cancel out, so we can write:

exp( -E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -E/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Because (n_upper/n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -E/(k T) )

If g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars (same transition), then the ratio would be exp(-E/(k T)).

So, for star1: R1 = exp(-E/(k T1)).

Star2: R2 = exp(-E/(k T2)).

Given R1=2 R2.

So, exp(-E/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-E/(k T2)).

Divide both sides by exp(-E/(k T2)):

exp( E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2.

Taking ln:

E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Which is the same as:

(E/k) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, same equation. So perhaps the equation to relate T1 and T2 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2))/E.

But the options don't have E or k, so perhaps I'm missing something. The question is asking which equation for the effective temperatures is correct, without knowing E or k. So perhaps the equation is expressed as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) * (k / E).

But since the options don't have E or k, perhaps the correct option would have ln(2) proportional to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), but scaled by some other factor.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

That's almost what we have, except for the (k/E) factor. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I did a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate. Let me go through the steps again.

1. The ratio of excited to ground state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)).

2. For star 1, R1 = 2 R2.

3. R1 = exp(-E/(k T1)).

4. R2 = exp(-E/(k T2)).

5. So R1 = 2 R2 => exp(-E/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-E/(k T2)).

6. Divide both sides by exp(-E/(k T2)):

   exp( -E/(k T1) + E/(k T2) ) = 2.

7. Which is exp( E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2.

8. Take ln:

   E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

9. Multiply numerator and denominator by T1 T2:

   E/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

So, the equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / E.

But the options don't have E or k. So perhaps the problem is designed to not require those constants, and the equation is simply ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think: for the ratio R1=2 R2, R1 = exp(-E/(k T1)), R2=exp(-E/(k T2)), so dividing gives R1/R2=exp(E/(k)(1/T2 - 1/T1))=2.

So ln( R1/R2 ) = (E/(k))(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Which would imply (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (k ln(2))/E.

But wait, the question gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. So perhaps the equation would involve this value.

Wait, but the options don't have numbers, so perhaps the correct equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2))/E, which would match if the option was (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2))/E, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should rearrange the equation (1/T2 -1/T1) = (k ln2)/E.

Which is (1/T2 -1/T1)= (k ln2)/E.

But that can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )= (k ln2)/E.

So, perhaps the equation is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) )= (k ln2)/E.

But the options don't have E or k, so perhaps the equation is presented as ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by something else.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which would match our equation if (k ln2)/E equals ln(2). But that would require (k/E) = 1, which isn't the case. So that can't be.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is not dependent on the exact value of ΔE, but the ratio. Wait, but the problem gives a specific ΔE. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait another thought: The question says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So E = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E = k. So E = k.

Then, E/k = 1.

So the equation (E/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) becomes (1) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which gives (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

Which is exactly option D.

Oh! So that's the key. Because E = k, so E/k =1, the equation simplifies to ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct equation is option D.

To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The excitation ratio of iron atoms in a specific energy level is proportional to \( \exp(-\Delta E / kT) \), where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are given as \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), with \( R_1 = 2R_2 \).

The Boltzmann equation for each star is:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio \( R_1 / R_2 \), we get:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( R_1 / R_2 = 2 \), we have:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The problem states that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant \( k \) is \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \).
