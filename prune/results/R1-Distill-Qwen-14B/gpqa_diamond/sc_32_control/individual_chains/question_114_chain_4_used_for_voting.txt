Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, two reactions are given, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

Wait a minute, let me think about each reaction step by step. 

The first reaction: butan-2-one is a ketone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, what usually happens? Oh, right, the nucleophilic substitution under certain conditions. But wait, ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution unless they're activated. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait no, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a substitution. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, which is a carbonyl group. So, perhaps this is a nucleophilic addition followed by elimination or something else.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the ketone oxygen is replaced by a hydroxyl and a nitrile group? Or maybe the ketone is converted into a secondary alcohol with a nitrile substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the ketone. Oh, wait, maybe it's a cyanide acting as a nucleophile. But ketones are not typically good for SN2 reactions because the carbonyl carbon is electrophilic but the leaving group (O-) isn't a good leaving group. Hmm, so maybe it's a two-step process. 

Wait, another thought: maybe the ketone is first converted into an enolate, but that's more for aldol reactions. Alternatively, I'm remembering that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide under acidic conditions, it can form a cyanohydrin. Oh, right! Cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with CN- in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

So, the reaction would be: ketone + CN- (from NaCN) + acid (H3O+) as catalyst → cyanohydrin. So reagent A would be H3O+ in this case. 

So looking at the options, reagents A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. The first reaction uses A, which is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Since in cyanohydrin formation, we need an acid catalyst, A should be H3O+. So in options A and B, A is H3O+. 

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

Wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid usually involves oxidation. But how? Common reagents for oxidizing nitriles to carboxylic acids include strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other oxidizing agents like H2O2 with certain catalysts. Another possibility is treating the nitrile with a strong acid and water, perhaps in the presence of a catalyst. 

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O. So the reaction is: nitrile → carboxylic acid with H2O and B. So what reagents are used for that? Oh, right, when a nitrile is treated with water under acidic conditions, it can hydrolyze. But wait, nitrile hydrolysis usually gives a carboxylic acid under certain conditions.

Wait, the general reaction for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is: R-CN + H2O (with acid and heat) → R-COOH. Alternatively, in basic conditions, it might form a sodium salt, but here the product is the acid, so it must be under acidic conditions.

So the reagent B should provide the acidic conditions. So B is HCl, because when HCl is present, it can act as a catalyst and acid in the hydrolysis. Alternatively, if B is H3O+ (like H2SO4), but looking at the options, for reagent B, the choices are HCl or CH3COOH (which is acetic acid). 

Wait, but the second reaction is: nitrile + H2O and B → carboxylic acid. So the reagent B must be providing an acidic environment. So possible options would be HCl (a strong acid) or CH3COOH (a weak acid). 

Which one is correct? For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, strong acids are typically used. Because the hydrolysis reaction is R-CN + 2 H2O → R-COOH + NH3 (but under acidic conditions, perhaps the ammonia is protonated). 

Wait, another approach: the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for this are H2O with H2SO4 (acidic conditions) or using KMnO4 under acidic and heated conditions. So if B is HCl, that could provide the acidic environment. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, it's a weak acid, which might not be strong enough. 

Wait, but looking at the options, for the second reaction, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So which one is more suitable for nitrile to carboxylic acid?

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction isn't a hydrolysis but an elimination or something else. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so hydrolysis is likely.

So, the reagent B is HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B for first part, but in the options, each option combines A and B). Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B for A), and for the second reaction, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So, in the second reaction, the nitrile is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. HCl can act as the acid catalyst. Alternatively, if B is HCl, then the reaction is in a strongly acidic condition, which would help in the hydrolysis of the nitrile.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, nitriles are hydrolyzed to amines under basic conditions, but that's when using a base. Or when using a strong acid, perhaps it's better for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait, the second product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction must be under acidic conditions. Thus, B should be HCl (a strong acid), providing the necessary acidic environment.

So putting it all together: the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and the second reaction uses HCl (so B is HCl).

Looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+ and B = HCl. That matches both conditions.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes H2O with acid and heat would be the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. So if the reagent B is HCl, that would make sense. 

So, in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+, so option A or B. Second reaction requires B to be HCl, so option A is the only one with B = HCl and A = H3O+.

Wait, but let me make sure. For the second reaction, is HCl the correct reagent? Alternative, what if B is H2O with a catalyst. But in the given options, the only reagents are HCl or CH3COOH.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl, which is a strong acid, so the reaction would proceed under acidic conditions to form the carboxylic acid. So the correct option is option A.

The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with cyanide ions (CN⁻) in the presence of an acid catalyst. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺, as it provides the acidic environment necessary for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For this reaction, an acidic environment is required, and HCl (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose. CH₃COOH, being a weak acid, is less effective for this transformation.

From the options provided:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B is not suitable for the second reaction.
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction.
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither A nor B is suitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
