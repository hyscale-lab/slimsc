Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait a second, but orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. These are probably buffer solutions because they're different forms of phosphate. So maybe I need to consider the buffer equation here.

Let me break it down. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters of crystallization. Its formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which when dissolved dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So that's the hydrogen phosphate ion.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are two consecutive species in the phosphate ion series. So the buffer system here is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, because the phosphate ion can lose protons. H3PO4 is triprotic. So the deprotonation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So here, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Therefore, the pH of the solution can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering K_a2 for the reaction H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

So the idea is that the concentration of HPO4^2- (which is what the question is asking for) will depend on the pH of the solution, which is determined by the buffer.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-, right?

So first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the ratio of their concentrations, which will allow me to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but since both salts are dissociated into these ions, I can calculate the moles of each and then apply the buffer equation.

Let me calculate the moles of each component.

First, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007334 mol.

This gives H2PO4^- ions. So moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007334 mol.

Next, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Each mole of this gives one mole of HPO4^2- ions, so moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005611 mol.

So in the solution, [H2PO4^-] is (0.007334 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.03667 M.

[HPO4^2-] is (0.005611 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.028055 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Are these concentrations accurate? Because when you dissolve the salts, yes, they dissociate completely, so yes, the concentrations are as calculated.

Now, the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, we don't know the pH yet. Oh, but perhaps we can find it because we have the concentrations of both buffer components.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is at the buffer's pH determined by the ratio of the two ions. So using the equation, we can compute pH, but wait, the question is about finding [HPO4^2-], which we already have.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. But wait, the problem is that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- but that's under very high pH conditions, which is not the case here since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is way smaller than Ka2.

Wait, but the presence of K+ and Na+ ions as spectator ions doesn't affect the pH much, so the pH is determined by the buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can find the pH, but wait, I'm already given the concentrations of the two ions. So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.028055)/(0.03667) ≈ 0.765.

So taking the log of that ratio is log(0.765) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.114) → pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.

But wait, do I need the pH for anything else? Because the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I already have [HPO4^2-] as 0.028055 M, but that's without considering any activity coefficients or anything else. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something because the solution may not be at the buffer's pH yet, but the presence of both ions would create a certain pH.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- after considering the dissociation, but no, because the initial concentrations are from the salts, which are strong electrolytes and dissociate completely. So the orthophosphate concentration is just the amount from the Na2HPO4·2H2O divided by the volume.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Because in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can act as a base, accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So, the actual concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution are not exactly as calculated from the initial moles because some of each may convert into the other based on the pH.

Hmm, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used precisely in such buffer systems to find the ratio of the concentrations. So perhaps I should use the initial concentrations as the initial amounts, then find the ratio based on pH, but I'm getting confused now.

Wait, another approach: the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their ratio.

The initial concentrations are [A-] = [H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 M, and [HA] = [HPO4^2-] = 0.028055 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-.

So [base] is [HPO4^2-], and [acid] is [H2PO4^-].

So, plugging in, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So pKa2 is about 7.208 as computed earlier.

We can compute the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028055 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.765.

Taking log(0.765) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.

But how does that help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-? I thought I already know the initial concentration, but perhaps that's the equilibrium concentration, which is influenced by the pH.

Wait, but the initial moles are from the salts, but in solution, some of the H2PO4^- may convert to HPO4^2- and vice versa. So perhaps I should set up an equilibrium expression.

Let me think: The initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028055 M.

But considering the dissociation reactions, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

The equilibrium expression is Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-].

Wait, but we can relate [H+] using pH, which we can compute from the buffer equation.

So from the buffer equation, pH = 7.094, so [H+] = 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

So plugging into the expression for Ka2:

Ka2 = ( [HPO4^2-] * [H+] ) / [H2PO4^-]

But wait, I already have [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-], but if the solution is at equilibrium, their concentrations have to satisfy this equation.

Wait, let me plug the numbers in.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

[H+] is 8.29e-8 M.

So ( [HPO4^2-] * 8.29e-8 ) / (0.03667) ) = 6.2e-8.

Multiply both sides by 0.03667:

[HPO4^2-] * 8.29e-8 = 6.2e-8 * 0.03667.

Divide both sides by 8.29e-8:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03667) / 8.29e-8.

Calculating numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.03667 ≈ 2.273e-9.

Denominator: 8.29e-8.

So [HPO4^2-] ≈ 2.273e-9 / 8.29e-8 ≈ 0.02745 M.

Wait, but previously, I thought [HPO4^2-] was 0.028055 M. Hmm, so this suggests that the actual concentration is lower, around 0.02745 M.

Wait, but that seems a bit conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, let me compute 6.2e-8 * 0.03667.

6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8.

Multiply that by 0.03667: 6.2 * 0.03667 ≈ 0.2273 (since 6x0.036 is 0.216, 0.2x0.036 is 0.0072, so total about 0.2232, let's say approximately 0.227).

So 0.227e-8 = 2.27e-9.

Divided by 8.29e-8: 2.27e-9 / 8.29e-8 ≈ (2.27/82.9) * 1e-1 → approximately (0.0274) * 0.1 = 0.00274? No, wait: 8.29e-8 is 8.29 x1e-8, so 2.27e-9 / 8.29e-8 = (2.27e-9) / (8.29e-8) = (2.27 /82.9 ) x 1e-1.

Wait, 2.27 /82.9 ≈ 0.0274, and 1e-1 is 0.1, so 0.0274 * 0.1 = 0.00274? That can't be right because the concentration would be way too low.

Wait, no, wait the exponents: 2.27e-9 is 2.27 x 10^-9, and 8.29e-8 is 8.29 x 10^-8.

So the division is (2.27e-9)/(8.29e-8) = (2.27/8.29) * 10^(-9+8) → 0.274 * 10^-1 → 0.0274.

So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.0274 M.

Wait, but earlier, I had an initial [HPO4^2-] of 0.028055 M. Hmm, but according to this calculation, it's 0.0274 M.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the pH, and from there, the [H+] is known, so I can plug that into the Ka equation to find the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think.

Alternatively, the total phosphate in solution comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the total moles of phosphate species is 0.007334 + 0.005611 = 0.012945 mol.

But these can interconvert based on pH.

So the sum [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = total phosphate.

But since Ka3 is very small, [PO4^3-] is negligible, so [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.012945 / 0.2 L = 0.064725 M.

Wait, but that's the total concentration of all phosphate species except PO4^3-.

But since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2, [HPO4^2-] and [PO4^3-] are much smaller in comparison. So [PO4^3-] is negligible.

So [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.064725 M.

Let me write the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But from the solution, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (from the initial moles) 0.005611 / 0.007334 ≈ 0.765.

Wait, but wait, that's using the initial moles. But in reality, the concentrations may have shifted due to the buffer action. So perhaps I should let [HPO4^2-] = x and [H2PO4^-] = 0.064725 - x.

Wait, no, because the total is 0.064725 M, which is the sum of the two.

Wait, but let me denote [H2PO4^-] as a and [HPO4^2-] as b. So a + b = 0.064725.

And from the buffer equation: pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

But I don't know pH yet. Alternatively, since I have two equations, I can solve for a and b.

Wait, but I also have the Ka2 expression: Ka2 = (b * [H+]) / a.

But [H+] can be expressed as 10^(-pH), and pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

So let me express everything in terms of a and b.

So, from the buffer equation: pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

From the Ka2 expression: Ka2 = (b [H+]) / a.

Substituting [H+] = 10^(-pH):

Ka2 = (b * 10^(-pH)) / a.

But pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

So substituting pH into the Ka2 equation:

Ka2 = (b * 10^(- (pKa2 + log(b/a))) ) / a.

Let me rearrange this.

Ka2 = (b * 10^(-pKa2) * 10^(-log(b/a))) ) / a.

But 10^(-log(b/a)) = a / b.

So,

Ka2 = (b * 10^(-pKa2) * (a/b) ) / a.

Simplify numerator: b*(a/b) = a.

So,

Ka2 = (a * 10^(-pKa2)) / a = 10^(-pKa2).

Wait, but that can't be right because 10^(-pKa2) is equal to Ka2.

Because pKa2 = -log10(Ka2), so 10^(-pKa2) = Ka2.

So that gives Ka2 = Ka2, which is an identity. Therefore, this approach doesn't help; I need another way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is equal to 10^(pH - pKa2).

But without knowing pH, this seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the pH using the initial concentrations and then find the ratio.

Wait, but let me think again: the initial moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.007334 and 0.005611, respectively. So without considering any reaction, their concentrations are 0.03667 M and 0.028055 M.

Using these concentrations in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH = 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

But wait, that's the pH that would be expected if there were no other changes, but perhaps that's the actual pH because the solution is a buffer and the concentrations are what they are.

But then, if the pH is 7.094, and I use this pH to calculate the [HPO4^2-], does that change anything?

Wait, but I think I'm going in circles here. Earlier, I tried plugging the pH into the Ka equation and got a different concentration for HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial concentrations are from the salts, and the solution may not have reached equilibrium. But in reality, the solution is at equilibrium, so the concentrations are determined by the buffer.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the initial concentrations are the equilibrium concentrations. But in reality, the solution is a buffer, so the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the pH, which in turn is determined by their ratio.

So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the pH using the initial concentrations, and then find the actual concentrations by considering the buffer.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Calculate moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the given masses.
2. Calculate their concentrations in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution.
4. Use the pH to find [H+], then apply the Ka2 expression to find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-].
5. However, since the ratio is already known from step 2, perhaps it's just a matter of computing the concentration based on the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- allows us to compute the pH, and from that, compute the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I think the key point is that the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution is determined by the buffer equation, which depends on the pH. But without knowing the pH, perhaps I can't find the exact concentration.

Wait, but I've used the initial concentrations to compute the pH, so perhaps the initial concentrations are the correct ones, and the answer is simply the initial [HPO4^2-], which is 0.028055 M.

But wait, none of the options are close to 0.028 M. The options are on the order of 1e-7 M.

Oh wait, wait a minute. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in unit conversion?

Wait, the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So 1 gram of KH2PO4 is 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007334 moles, which in 0.2 liters is 0.03667 M.

Wait, but the options are about 1e-7 M, which is much smaller. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, no, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.

The question is: What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?

Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

But wait, perhaps the solution is not simply a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because I added both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the total concentration of phosphate species would be the sum of the two, but how they are distributed depends on the pH.

Wait, but the problem is to find [HPO4^2-], which is the concentration of orthophosphate.

But perhaps the solution is more complicated because each salt contributes to the solution. Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that all H2PO4^- remains as H2PO4^- and all HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-, which would make [HPO4^2-] = 0.028055 M. But none of the options are close to that, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the nature of the salts. Let me think again. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03667 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028055 M.

But wait, in reality, H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So the buffer system is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the total concentration of phosphate species is 0.03667 + 0.028055 ≈ 0.064725 M.

The buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So pH = pKa2 + log(0.028055/0.03667) → as calculated earlier, pH ≈ 7.094.

But then, in this buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium. So, using the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = ( [HPO4^2-][H+] ) / [H2PO4^-].

We know Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and [H+] is 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.29e-8.

Let me plug these into the equation.

6.2e-8 = (0.028055 * 8.29e-8) / 0.03667.

Calculating numerator: 0.028055 * 8.29e-8 ≈ 2.333e-9.

Divide by 0.03667: 2.333e-9 / 0.03667 ≈ 6.366e-8.

Which is approximately 6.366e-8, but Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is close enough considering rounding errors.

So this suggests that the initial concentrations are correct, and the [HPO4^2-] is 0.028055 M.

But wait, the options are way lower, like 5.48e-7 M, which is about 5.48 x 10^-7 M, which is much smaller than 0.028 M.

So I'm clearly missing something here. Perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not in the condition where HPO4^2- is the dominant species. Maybe the phosphate is more deprotonated than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH first and then find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I've done that. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the species. Let me think about the possible species in solution.

H3PO4 can lose three protons, but in this case, we're adding KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-). So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The pH of the solution will determine how much of each is present. So let me compute the pH using the buffer equation, then use that to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the buffer equation uses the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], which is given by the initial concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH, and then find [HPO4^2-] based on that, considering the total concentration of phosphate.

Wait, let me try a different approach.

Total phosphate concentration is 0.064725 M (from earlier).

The pH is 7.094.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 10^(pH - pKa2).

pKa2 is about 7.208.

So pH - pKa2 = 7.094 -7.208 = -0.114.

So the ratio is 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.774.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.774 * [H2PO4^-].

But the sum [HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-] = 0.064725.

Let me set [H2PO4^-] = x.

Then [HPO4^2-] = 0.774 x.

So x + 0.774 x = 0.064725 → 1.774 x = 0.064725 → x ≈ 0.064725 / 1.774 ≈ 0.03646 M.

Then [HPO4^2-] = 0.774 * 0.03646 ≈ 0.02816 M.

Hmm, that's close to the initial 0.028055 M. So the initial assumption holds, and the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.028 M.

But this is way higher than any of the options provided. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer but about the actual speciation considering all the equilibria. Or perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3- or HPO4^2- under certain conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 g is 1 mole, so 1.00 g is 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007334 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

177.99 g is 1 mole, so 1.00 g is 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Yes, correct.

So the initial concentrations are correct.

So why are the options so much lower?

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3-, not HPO4^2-.

Wait, the question says "orthophosphate ions", which I thought was HPO4^2-. But perhaps it's referring to PO4^3-?

Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, so the conjugate base is H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

But the problem states 'orthophosphate ions', which I'm a bit confused about. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, so its conjugate base is H2PO4^-.

Wait, but sometimes orthophosphate is considered as the HPO4^2- ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the phosphate exists in a certain form, considering the K_a values.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- by considering the pH of the solution and the total phosphate concentration.

Wait, another approach: The total phosphate concentration is 0.064725 M, as the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I can find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-].

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-}) → 7.094 = 7.208 + log(r), where r is the ratio.

So log(r) = 7.094 -7.208 = -0.114 → r = 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.774.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.774 * [H2PO4^-].

Total [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.064725 M.

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] as x. Then [HPO4^2-] = 0.774 x.

So x + 0.774 x = 0.064725 → 1.774 x = 0.064725 → x ≈ 0.03646 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.774 * 0.03646 ≈ 0.02816 M.

But that's still 0.028 M, which is not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the solution is not considering the buffer but the individual contributions.

Wait, perhaps I should find the concentration of HPO4^2- without considering any dissociation, but it's not possible because the problem gives the K_a values, so the solution must involve some equilibria.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is at a different pH where HPO4^2- is the dominant species.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of the H2PO4^- has dissociated into HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I've already considered that via the buffer approach.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B) 5.48x10^-7 M 

C) 2.81x10^-7 M

D) 3.97x10^-7 M 

These are all in the range of 1e-7 M, which is way lower than my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that it's the product of one of the K_a expressions.

Wait, perhaps the solution is about the hydrolysis of HPO4^2-.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Na2HPO4·2H2O is the source of HPO4^2-, which can hydrolyze in water.

The reaction would be HPO4^2- + H2O ↔ H2PO4^- + OH^-.

The K for this reaction is Kb = Kw / Ka3.

Because Kb is for the reaction where HPO4^2- acts as a base, accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-12 ≈ 5.556e-3.

So Kb is about 5.556e-3.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028055 M, but if it hydrolyzes, the concentration will decrease as some converts to H2PO4^-.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

HPO4^2- + H2O ↔ H2PO4^- + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [H2PO4^-][OH^-] / [HPO4^2-].

But without knowing [OH^-], it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by Kb and the initial concentration.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

The initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028055 M.

Let me denote the change as x, where some HPO4^2- converts to H2PO4^- and OH^-.

So, at equilibrium:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028055 - x

[H2PO4^-] = x (from HPO4^2- hydrolysis) + initial 0.03667 (from KH2PO4).

Wait, but this might not be correct because the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- would contribute to [H2PO4^-], which already has a significant concentration from KH2PO4.

Alternatively, perhaps the HPO4^2- hydrolyzes, but the contribution is small, so x is much smaller than 0.028055.

But I'm not sure. Let me set up the equation.

Kb = (x)([OH^-]) / (0.028055 - x) ≈ (x [OH^-])/0.028055.

But [OH^-] is 1e-14 / [H+].

Earlier, we found [H+] ≈8.29e-8, so [OH^-} ≈ 1.2e-7.

So Kb ≈ (x * 1.2e-7) / 0.028055.

Set Kb to 5.556e-3:

5.556e-3 = (x *1.2e-7)/0.028055.

Solving for x:

x = (5.556e-3 * 0.028055) / 1.2e-7.

Calculating numerator: 5.556e-3 * 0.028055 ≈ 1.557e-4.

Divide by 1.2e-7: x ≈ (1.557e-4) / (1.2e-7) ≈ 1297.5 M.

But that's impossible because x can't be larger than the initial concentration of HPO4^2- (0.028 M). So this suggests that the assumption that x is small is invalid. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is not significant compared to the buffer effect.

Wait, maybe I should consider the pH of the solution, which is 7.094, and see if HPO4^2- can hydrolyze further.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is focused on the second dissociation step, but I'm getting confused.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the problem is about finding the concentration of HPO4^2- given the buffer and using the K_a2 expression.

Wait, I have [HPO4^2-] = 0.028055 M, [H2PO4^-} = 0.03667 M, and [H+] = 8.29e-8.

Ka2 = ( [HPO4^2-][H+] ) / [H2PO4^-}.

Plugging in:

(0.028055 * 8.29e-8) / 0.03667 ≈ (2.33e-9) / 0.03667 ≈ 6.36e-8.

Which is close to Ka2 of 6.2e-8. So the initial concentrations are correct.

Thus, [HPO4^2-} is approximately 0.028 M, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me check the problem again.

The problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles correctly.

Wait, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the formula weight is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g is 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005611 moles. Each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So [HPO4^2-} = 0.005611 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028055 M.

Similarly, KH2PO4 is 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007334 mol. Each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

[H2PO4^-} = 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.

So these concentrations are correct.

But according to the options, the correct answer is much lower.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in a different scenario, such as the solution after considering the hydrolysis of both species, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to account for the fact that some of the H2PO4^- is deprotonating to form HPO4^2-, which would change the initial concentrations.

Wait, but that's what the buffer equation accounts for.

Wait, perhaps the solution requires me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the pH and the total phosphate concentration.

Let me try that.

Total phosphate concentration is 0.064725 M.

The ratio of [HPO4^2-} to [H2PO4^-} is 0.774.

So, [HPO4^2-} = 0.774 * [H2PO4^-}.

And [H2PO4^-} = x.

So x + 0.774 x = 0.064725 → 1.774 x = 0.064725 → x ≈ 0.03646 M.

So [HPO4^2-} =0.774 * 0.03646 ≈ 0.02816 M.

Still the same result.

But again, the options are way lower. So perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the third dissociation step, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the solution as a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, but the concentrations are so high that it's not in the dilute limit, making the approximation invalid.

Wait, but the solution is 0.2 L with about 0.007334 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005611 mol of HPO4^2-.

So perhaps the solution is more concentrated than the approximations allow.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, the third dissociation step is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.094, [H+] is 8.29e-8.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using Ka3.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-}[H+]/[HPO4^2-}.

So [PO4^3-} = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-}) ) / [H+}.

Plugging in:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028055) / 8.29e-8 ≈ (5.05e-14) / 8.29e-8 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Which is about 6.09e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close.

So perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- instead of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question specifically says 'orthophosphate ions', which is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a mistake, but given the options, the correct answer would be A) 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, with molecular weights of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L), and the dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of KH₂PO₄} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007334 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes 0.007334 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.  
  **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻**:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007334 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03667 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005611 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  This contributes 0.005611 mol of HPO₄²⁻.  
  **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻**:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005611 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.028055 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
\]  
- **pKa₂**:  
  \[
  \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208.
  \]
- **Ratio**:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028055}{0.03667} \approx 0.765.
  \]
- **pH**:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.
  \]

### Step 3: Verify equilibrium concentrations using Ka₂
The equilibrium constant expression for Ka₂ is:  
\[
\text{Ka}_2 = \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}.
\]  
- **[H⁺]**:  
  \[
  [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **Ka₂ check**:  
  \[
  \text{Ka}_2 = \frac{(0.028055)(8.29 \times 10^{-8})}{0.03667} \approx \frac{2.33 \times 10^{-9}}{0.03667} \approx 6.36 \times 10^{-8}.
  \]  
  This is close to the given Ka₂ (6.2×10⁻⁸), confirming the equilibrium concentrations are consistent.

### Step 4: Reassess the question and options
The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻). However, the calculated concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is approximately **0.028 M**, which is much higher than the provided options (all on the order of 10⁻⁷ M). This discrepancy suggests the question may be asking for the concentration of PO₄³⁻, the fully deprotonated phosphate ion, instead of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 5: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
PO₄³⁻ forms from the third dissociation step:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H}^+.
\]  
The equilibrium constant for this step is Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹². Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]  
- **[PO₄³⁻]**:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]} = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028055)}{8.29 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.29 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.09 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
  \]  
  This value aligns closely with option **A (6.24×10⁻⁷ M)**.

### Conclusion
The question appears to ask for the concentration of PO₄³⁻ rather than HPO₄²⁻. Based on the calculations, the concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately **6.09×10⁻⁷ M**, which matches option **A (6.24×10⁻⁷ M)**.

**Answer: A**
