Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the main structure seems to be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, there's another substituent attached to the cyclohexane ring: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me draw this mentally.

So, the cyclohexane ring has two substituents: one is the aldehyde group, and the other is a branch. That branch is a methyl group (-CH2-) attached to another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure might look something like cyclohexane with a CH2CHO group attached and another CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexane ring and an OH.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a triple bond, so it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). So, the starting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond attached.

I need to find the correct sequence of reagents to convert ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different sequence of reactions.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The target has an aldehyde group, an alcohol group, and a cyclohexane ring. Let's outline the steps needed.

First, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Maybe we need to do some kind of addition or substitution. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (since it's -C≡CH). Common reactions for terminal alkynes might involve deprotonation, like using a strong base like NaNH2, which could deprotonate the alkyne to form a strong base, like the cyclohexynide ion.

Once we have that, maybe we can do an alkylation. For example, in the presence of a methyl chloride (CH3Cl), the strong base could abstract a proton, making the alkyne more nucleophilic, and then methyl chloride could provide a methyl group. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, if we use NaNH2 followed by methyl chloride, perhaps this is a deprotonation and alkylation step. That would add a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is H-C≡C-cyclohexane. If we deprotonate it with NaNH2, which is a strong base, we'll get the cyclohexynide ion: -C≡C-^- Na+. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is an alkylating agent; the alkyne would attack the methyl chloride. So the product would be CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane? Wait, no, because CH3Cl is an electrophilic source of CH3+. So, the alkyne would take a methyl group, giving CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane? Or is it adding across the triple bond?

Wait, no, the alkyne is linear. Deprotonating the terminal alkyne gives a strong base (the acetylide). Then, alkylation would add an alkyl group to the acetylide carbon. So, maybe from H-C≡C-R (R is cyclohexane), after deprotonation, we get R-C≡C^- which would attack CH3Cl, giving R-C≡C-CH3. So, the product would be 1-cyclohexenylpropyne or something else? Wait, no, the structure would be CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane, but that's not possible since the triple bond would be between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So, that's 1-cyclohexylethyne?

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the overall process.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a CHO group and a CH2 group which is connected to another cyclohexane and an OH. So, perhaps the starting material (ethynylcyclohexane) needs to be modified to add a methyl group and then undergo some kind of oxidation.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the triple bond needs to be converted into a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a question of adding substituents and then oxidizing.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the process involves adding a hydroxyl group and a methyl group in a certain way.

Let me think about each reagent step by step for each option.

Looking at the options, they all have multiple steps. Let's consider each option:

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, the third step is written twice as 3 and 4. That's probably a typo, but perhaps it's a misprint. So, maybe step 3 is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, etc.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and MeCl. As I thought earlier, deprotonate the alkyne to form cyclohexynide, then methyl chloride would alkylate it. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Then step 2: H2 with Pd. That's hydrogenation, which would add H2 across triple bonds, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So, CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane would become CH2CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically result in a cis double bond, but wait—no, when you hydrogenate a triple bond in the presence of H2 and a catalyst like Pd, it would add two H's across the triple bond, leading to a single bond. So, CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane becomes CH2CH2-cyclohexane? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait. The triple bond is in the middle; hydrogenation would add two Hs, making a single bond. So, CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane becomes CH2CH2-cyclohexane. Wait, no, that would make it CH2CH2 attached to cyclohexane. So, that's cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group. But CH2CH2 isn't a thing; perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH2 being ethylene, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the product is CH2CH2-cyclohexane, but that would be CH2CH2 as a substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: the alkyne is CH3-C≡C-R (where R is cyclohexane). Hydrogenation would add H's across the triple bond. So, the triple bond (sp-hybridized) becomes a single bond (sp3), so the structure would become CH2CH2-R, but that's not possible because CH2CH2 isn't a stable structure. Wait, perhaps the triple bond is between two carbons, each attached to something else. So, if you have CH3-C≡C-R, hydrogenation would make CH3-CH2-CH2-R. Wait, no. No, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and Pd typically gives cis-alkene first, but if excess H2 is used, it can go all the way to the alkane. Wait, no, using H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, not necessarily stopping at the double bond. So, CH3-C≡C-R becomes CH2-CH2-R. But that's a single bond with two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to alkylate the alkyne, making it longer. Then, the next step would be to hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. So, after step 2, we have a cyclohexane with a longer chain.

But then, step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can induce elimination reactions. Maybe it's used for epoxidation or for some kind of elimination. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, it's used in the Dieckmann condensation, but that's for esters. Hmm. Alternatively, considering Ba(OH)2 in a dihydroxylation context. Wait, perhaps it's for oxidation or elimination.

Wait, maybe after step 2, we have a longer chain, and step 3 is a way to form a diol or something else. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols? Or perhaps it's used in a Hofmann elimination or something similar.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the other options as well.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Hmm, step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then ethyl chloride would provide an ethyl group. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2CH2-C≡C-R? Wait, no. Wait, ethyl chloride is C2H5Cl. So, when the acetylide (R-C≡C^-) attacks ethyl chloride, the product would be R-C≡C-CH2CH3. So, ethynylcyclohexane (H-C≡C-R) becomes CH2CH2-C≡C-R? No, wait, the acetylide is R-C≡C^- Na+; when it reacts with ethyl chloride (C2H5Cl), it would form R-C≡C-CH2CH3. So, the triple bond is between R and CH2CH3.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, often used for deprotonation or elimination. Li in NH3 is used for the formation of Grignard reagents, but more often, it's used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, perhaps this is a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's for the formation of organometallic compounds. Hmm, but the product after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. What's the next step.

Wait, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Maybe it's used for deprotonating something else, but if the molecule is R-C≡C-CH2CH3, perhaps it's a way to form another acetylide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to cause an elimination. But what's the structure after step 1: R-C≡C-CH2CH3. So, the alkyne is now longer. Then, step 2 uses Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it's an elimination reaction, but from where?

Wait, perhaps the step after alkylating the alkyne is to form a longer chain, then perform a hydrogenation. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Step 3 in option B is O3 followed by H2O. That's ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. But wait, if the molecule at this point is R-C≡C-CH2CH3, which is a triple bond, ozonolysis is for double bonds. So, perhaps after step 2, the triple bond is converted into a double bond? Or maybe step 2 is a way to do something else.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation. No, Li in NH3 is a strong base, not a hydrogenation catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation followed by some kind of elimination. Wait, I'm not clear here.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

So, step 1: same as option A, alkylating the alkyne with methyl chloride.

Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3. That's hydrogenation. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So, the product after step 1 is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane, which, after hydrogenation, becomes CH2CH2-cyclohexane. Wait, but CH2CH2 isn't a real structure; perhaps it's CH2CH2 as in ethane group attached. So, structure becomes cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group attached. So, ethylcyclohexane?

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is H-C≡C-cyclohexane. After step 1 (alkylation), it becomes CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then, step 2 hydrogenates that, adding H2 across the triple bond, giving CH2CH2-cyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group attached, so ethylcyclohexane.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if the molecule is ethylcyclohexane (which has a single bond), perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule isn't ethylcyclohexane but something else. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the hydrogenation. Let me think again: the triple bond in CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane is between the cyclohexane and the CH3. So hydrogenation would add H's to each carbon, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So, it would become CH2CH2-cyclohexane, but that's not a correct structure. Wait, perhaps it becomes CH2CH2 as in a two-carbon chain attached to cyclohexane. So, that would be ethylcyclohexane.

But then, step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, not single bonds. So, perhaps the product after step 2 is an alkene, not an alkane. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation uses a different catalyst. Wait, Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds, but perhaps in some cases, it can stop at the alkene. But I thought Pd typically fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but I'm not sure. If after step 2, the triple bond becomes a double bond, then ozonolysis in step 3 would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But if the structure is CH3-C=CH-cyclohexane, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. But that's speculative.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

So, step 1: using NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is an alcohol. So, perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol, which is an oxygen nucleophile. Wait, but methanol isn't a good alkylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is formed, and then it captures a methyl group from methanol. Wait, but methanol is CH3OH. If the acetylide is R-C≡C^-, and we have CH3OH, perhaps it would react to form R-C≡C-OCH3? That would be an O-methylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is forming a Grignard reagent, but that's with Mg, not NaNH2. Wait, NaNH2 is used to deprotonate alkynes to form acetylides. So, perhaps in step 1, the alkyne is deprotonated to R-C≡C^- Na+, then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, maybe this step is for some kind of substitution. Hmm, maybe I'm not clear on this.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne, then using methanol to form an ether. But I'm not sure.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination or forming organometallics. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Finally, step 4 is NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for acid workup or hydrolysis.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on each step. Let's think about the target molecule again. It is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring has a CHO group and a CH2 group attached. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent to the cyclohexane ring, then introducing an aldehyde group and an alcohol group.

Looking at the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe the alkyne can be converted into a ketone or aldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol or a carbonyl group. For instance, through a hydration reaction. But which reagents would do that?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps in terms of overall process.

Looking for the target molecule's substituents: a cyclohexyl group (from ethynylcyclohexane), a methyl group attached with an OH, and a CHO group.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.
2. The alkyne is then hydrogenated to an alkane.
3. Then, some kind of oxidation or cleavage to form a carbonyl group.
4. Then, introduce a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is transformed into a carbonyl group, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach. The target molecule's structure could be built by first adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating the alkyne into a single bond, forming a longer chain. Then, perhaps an oxidation step to form a carbonyl and an alcohol.

Wait, let's think about the steps again.

Option C: step 1 is alkylating the alkyne with methyl chloride, turning ethynylcyclohexane into CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then step 2 is hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2CH2-cyclohexane, which is ethylcyclohexane. Then step 3 is ozonolysis. But ethylcyclohexane doesn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne is deprotonated to the acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol isn't a good methylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form a ketone or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to form an ether. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each reagent does in each step.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps elimination or epoxidation. Not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → looks like a Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or acids. But if the structure after step 3 is something with an alcohol, this would oxidize it.

But I'm not sure what's happening after step 2. If step 3 is Ba(OH)2, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, it could be for saponification, but that's for esters.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to induce epoxide formation, but that's usually with peracids.

Wait, maybe step 3 in option A is a Hofmann elimination. If the product after step 2 is ethylcyclohexane, perhaps Ba(OH)2 isn't applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Option B:

Step 1: alkylate the alkyne with ethyl chloride → CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → possible elimination. If you have a triple bond, maybe it's converted into a double bond via deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, but Li in NH3 is a strong base. If the molecule is R-C≡C-CH2CH3, maybe the Li would abstract a proton adjacent to the triple bond, leading to an elimination and forming a double bond. So, R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH2CH2Li? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation leading to a trans-alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a way to form a Grignard reagent, but I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3 and H2O → ozonolysis of a double bond. So, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for workup.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group, so perhaps the ozonolysis isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct steps.

Let me think about the overall process. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne.
2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer chain.
3. Oxidizing the chain to form a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde via hydration. For example, using H2O and a catalyst to hydrate the alkyne into a ketone. But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group with OH, so maybe that's part of the process.

Wait, another approach: After adding a methyl group to the alkyne, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond (making a longer chain), then oxidized to form a carbonyl group. For example, ethylcyclohexane can be oxidized to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each reagent's purpose.

The target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, the reagents that could form an aldehyde include ozonolysis (which can cleave double bonds into carbonyls) or perhaps a ketone that's then reduced. Wait, no, aldehydes are more oxidized than ketones. Alternatively, oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but that's not helpful here.

Wait, another thought: The target has an aldehyde group and a secondary alcohol. So, maybe during the synthesis, an oxidizing agent is used to form the aldehyde, and another step forms the alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed via a oxidation of a primary alcohol, but that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is formed from a Grignard reagent. But in the options, I don't see Mg-based reagents, so that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via a oxidation of a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde group comes from the ozonolysis of a double bond. For example, if a double bond is present in the molecule, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, if the molecule has a double bond adjacent to the cyclohexane, ozonolysis would form a carbonyl group.

Looking back at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis. So, let's see:

Option C:

Step 1: Alkylation of the alkyne with methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: Hydrogenation → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

But ethylcyclohexane doesn't have a double bond. So, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete. If the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene instead of an alkane, then ozonolysis would work. But I thought Pd typically fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Unless the catalyst is poisoned or another condition is used to stop at the alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't the correct step.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a reduction, such as using H2/Ni to stop at the alkene. But the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is for full hydrogenation.

Hmm. Maybe the correct steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.
2. Partial hydrogenation to form an alkene.
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde and alcohol.

But I'm not sure which option fits this.

Looking at option B:

Step 1: ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonates and forms a double bond. So, the alkyne becomes a trans-alkene.

Then step 3: ozonolysis → cleavage into carbonyls.

Then step 4: NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But the target doesn't have a double bond, so perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne needs to be converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another angle: The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon that's also attached to the cyclohexane and a methyl group. So, perhaps that carbon is formed via a Grignard addition, but I'm not seeing Mg reagents in the options.

Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl group is formed via an epoxide opening. But I don't see epoxidation steps in any of the options except perhaps Ba(OH)2 in option A.

Wait, another possibility: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is then attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, and then one of the OH groups is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized to form a diol, but that's not making much sense.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → deprotonate alkyne to form acetylide, then react with methanol. Acetylide + CH3OH → perhaps forms a ketone via a nucleophilic attack. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an ether, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe methanol is used in a substitution. Hmm.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → strong base, perhaps for elimination to form a double bond.

If after step 1, the molecule is R-C≡C-OCH3 (unlikely), then step 2 could eliminate to form a double bond. But I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous workup.

But without knowing the exact structure after step 2, it's hard to say.

Another thought: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached, which is further attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH. So, the CH2 group is like a methylene group attached to both rings and the OH. So, perhaps the CH2 comes from a CH2 group that was part of a longer chain, which was then cleaved.

Wait, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups. If the molecule has a double bond between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. So, if the molecule was R-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would give R-CHO and R'-CHO. But in the target, one of the groups is a cyclohexyl-OH-CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, hydrogenated to a single bond, then oxidized to form a ketone, which is further processed.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the reagents in each option and see which ones would logically produce the necessary functional groups.

The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxymethyl) group (CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)).

So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne (step 1 in options A, B, C).
2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to a single bond (step 2 in options A, C).
3. Oxidizing the resulting compound to form a carbonyl group (maybe via ozonolysis or other oxidation).
4. Introducing a hydroxyl group, perhaps via a dihydroxylation or epoxide opening.

Wait, but introducing a hydroxyl group adjacent to a cyclohexane ring would require some specific conditions.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: Alkylation → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → but ethylcyclohexane doesn't have a double bond; ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this option seems incorrect.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms an ether, but not sure. If the product is R-C≡C-OCH3, then step 2 (Li in NH3) could eliminate to form a double bond.

So, step 2: R-C≡C-OCH3 → R-C=CH2 + something. Then, step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. So, if the molecule is R-C=CH2, ozonolysis would give R-CHO and formaldehyde. But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so perhaps the ozonolysis would produce the aldehyde needed.

Then, step 4: NH4OH → perhaps hydrolysis of any protecting groups or workup.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps that CH(OH)CH2 comes from a vicinal diol that's formed via some dihydroxylation. Then, perhaps one of the OHs is oxidized, but I don't see any dihydroxylation reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH(OH) group is formed via a hydroxylation of an alkene.

Looking back, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer chain.
3. Ozonolysis of a double bond formed earlier to form a carbonyl group.
4. Hydrolysis to form the aldehyde and the alcohol.

But I'm still not clear.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think about it.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. I think this would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, which would then react with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to form a ketone via a hydration reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's used in a different way.

Wait, another possibility: NaNH2 and methanol could form a methyl Grignard-like reagent, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an alkyne ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne, and then methylating it with methanol to make R-C≡C-OCH3. But that's an ether, which I'm not sure is helpful.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Perhaps this is a deprotonation to form a stronger base, like a lithium acetylide, but I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis on a triple bond doesn't do anything, but if the alkyne was converted into a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, but for ozonolysis to work, there needs to be a double bond. So, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene.

If step 1 makes R-C≡C-OCH3, then step 2 could eliminate to form R-C=CH2.

Then, step 3 would ozonolyze R-C=CH2 into R-CHO and HCHO (formaldehyde). But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so perhaps the R is the cyclohexane.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group on the CH(OH) group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne → alkylated to add a methyl group.
2. Converted to a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination.
3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde and alcohol.

But I'm still not seeing the exact pathway.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. The target requires an aldehyde group and a secondary alcohol group attached to the cyclohexane.

Looking at the options, option C has a step 3 of ozonolysis, which could form carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes. Then, perhaps one of those aldehydes is the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde in the target.

But earlier steps don't clearly form a double bond. However, option C's step 2 uses H2/Pd, which I thought would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: Maybe after step 1, the alkyne is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then, step 2 is hydrogenation to CH3-CH2-cyclohexane. But that's not correct, because hydrogenation of an alkyne would add two Hs, turning a triple bond into a single bond, making the structure CH2CH2-cyclohexane, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the alkyne but of another functional group.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, thinking about the target, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne → alkylated to add a methyl group.
2. Alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination (step 2 in option D: Li in NH3).
3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form two carbonyl groups (step 3 in D).
4. Workup to form the aldehyde and the alcohol (step 4 in D).

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group. So, perhaps the CH(OH) comes from a diol that's formed via epoxidation and acid workup.

But without seeing an epoxidation step in the options, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a double bond that is epoxidized, then opened to form the diol, which is then oxidized.

But again, I don't see those reagents in the options.

At this point, I think I've thought through all the possibilities. I'm going to make an educated guess based on the steps that would form both the aldehyde and the alcohol.

The correct reagents would likely involve:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, creating a longer chain.
3. Ozonolysis to break the chain into carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde and alcohol.

Looking at the options, option C includes ozonolysis, but the hydrogenation step might not set up the molecule correctly. Alternatively, option D might form the necessary double bond for ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no, because in option C, after step 2, the molecule doesn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't work.

I think I'm going to settle on option D as the correct answer, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group. So, perhaps the CH(OH) comes from a Grignard addition, but I don't see Mg in any options. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then oxidized to a ketone, and then the ketone is reduced to an alcohol.

But none of the options clearly show that.

After all this, I'm going to conclude that option C is the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, consists of a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group (CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)) attached. The synthesis begins with ethynylcyclohexane, which contains a terminal alkyne group. The analysis of the options involves determining which sequence of reagents can convert the starting material into the target molecule.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the alkyne, yielding CH₃-C≡C-cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming CH₂CH₂-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but the exact role is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation conditions, typically used to oxidize alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. However, the intermediate after step 3 is not clearly an alcohol.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule, as the steps do not account for forming the hydroxyl group or the aldehyde group.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with ethyl chloride, yielding CH₂CH₂-C≡C-cyclohexane.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, which could convert the alkyne into an alkene.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. If a double bond is formed in step 2, ozonolysis would generate carbonyl compounds.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous workup, possibly to hydrolyze intermediates.

While this sequence involves ozonolysis, the intermediates do not align with the target molecule, as the hydroxyl group and cyclohexyl substituents are not clearly formed.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with methyl chloride, yielding CH₃-C≡C-cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming CH₂CH₂-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, the intermediate after step 2 does not contain a double bond, so ozonolysis would not proceed.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but its role is unclear.

This sequence fails because ozonolysis cannot act on a single bond, and the steps do not produce the required functional groups.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and reacts with methanol, potentially forming an ether or a different intermediate.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, which could convert the alkyne into an alkene.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. If a double bond is formed in step 2, ozonolysis would generate carbonyl compounds.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous workup, possibly to hydrolyze intermediates.

This sequence is plausible, as it involves forming a double bond in step 2, which can be cleaved by ozonolysis in step 3 to form carbonyl groups. However, the exact formation of the hydroxyl group and cyclohexyl substituents is unclear.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the most likely to align with the required transformations, despite some uncertainties in the steps.
