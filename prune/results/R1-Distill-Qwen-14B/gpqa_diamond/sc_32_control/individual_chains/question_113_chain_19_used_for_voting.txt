Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopy data. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's start with each piece of data.

First, FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests there's an -OH group. Because broad peaks in that region are usually from O-H stretching. So we might be dealing with something like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak; that's probably a carbonyl group. Like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower. Could that be a conjugated carbonyl or something else? Maybe an aromatic ring? Or maybe an amide? But wait, the other peaks don't suggest an amide. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an ester or a ketone with some conjugation.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 could be ester or ketone, and 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl. Or maybe that's a C=C stretching? Because C=C's are around 1600-1680. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond.

Next the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're in a double bond, so the compound has at least one double bond. So maybe an alkene or maybe a ring with double bonds, like aromatic. But wait, the FTIR didn't show strong absorption around 1500 for aromatic C-H, but wait, the broad peak might be from something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. What's that? The m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let's think: CH3CO+ is 43, but wait, maybe 45 comes from something else. Oh, wait, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CO, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group plus something. Wait, 45 could be a fragment like CH3CO- or maybe another group.

Now, looking at the options for the formula: they are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So possible functional groups.

Let me consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is one ring or double bond. For C6H12O2, the formula would be C6H12O2. The general formula for an organic compound is CnH2n+2O. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU). DoU = (2n +2 - x + y)/2, where n is number of carbons, x is number of hydrogens, y is halogens (none here). So, for C6H12O2, n=6, x=12. So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But considering the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that's a double bond, so that fits. Now, the functional groups: O2. So maybe an ester (which has O2) or a ketone and an alcohol, but more likely an ester. Ester would have a carbonyl (the 1700 peak), and an -OH? Or wait, in an ester, the O is in the carbonyl and the oxygen in the ester group. Wait, the FTIR showed a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H from an alcohol or maybe from a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acid would also have O-H. But if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol, but esters don't have free -OH groups. Hmm, maybe the 3000 peak is from an alcohol. But in that case, the formula would need an OH. Let's think.

Wait, another functional group with O2 is a ketone and an alcohol. That would give O2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester like a lactone. That could have a carbonyl and an ester group, but I'm not certain.

Option B: C6H10O. So, the formula would have n=6, x=10. DoU = (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so one double bond. So another ring or a second double bond. Hmm. Could be a diene, but if the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 1650 for that, but the IR has 1700 and 1650. Wait, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, but no, if the compound is C6H10O, perhaps a cyclic ether with a double bond. Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. So n=6, x=10. DoU = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds. If one is a double bond (from vinyl H), another could be a ring or another double bond. Now, O2 could be an ester, a ketone and an alcohol, a carboxylic acid and something else, or a cyclic ether with, say, an ester. Hmm. The IR has a broad peak at 3000 (O-H) and 1700 (carbonyl). So maybe a carboxylic acid, but then the other peak at 1650 would be the C-O stretch, but wait, carboxylic acids have O-H and a carbonyl. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol (if it's a free -OH). Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would be in another group, but the FTIR has a broad peak which suggests a strong O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the other peak in IR is 1650. Wait, carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700, and an O-H around 2500-3300. But the broad peak here is at 3000. Maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ring or something else.

Option D: C6H12O. So, n=6, x=12. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond. So that fits. But what about the O? It's an alcohol, perhaps. So the FTIR shows O-H stretch (alcohol) and maybe another peak? But the 1700 is a carbonyl. So the compound would have both an alcohol and a carbonyl group. That would be a compound like a ketone and an alcohol, but that's possible. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ether or something else.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. What's 45? Let's calculate the molecular weight for each formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular formula: 6*12 +12 +32 = 72+12+32=116. But the fragment is 45.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight:6*12+10 +16=72+10+16=98. 45 is less than that. So possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. 6*12+10 +32=72+10+32=114. Fragment 45 is possible.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100. So 45 is possible.

So how does the fragment at 45 come about? 45 could be a fragment like (CH3)2CO, but wait, (CH3)2CO is 58 (molecular weight of acetone is 58). Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a smaller fragment, like a CH2CH2O group or something else.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at m/z 45 could be from a CH3COO- group, but that would be 60 (CH3COO- is 59, but wait, maybe not. Hmm. Alternatively, it could be a CH3CO+ ion, which is 43. But the peak is at 45, so maybe it's another fragment.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester fragment. Like CH2CH2COO- but that's probably not 45.

Wait, another approach: what compounds have a fragment at 45? For example, the fragment could be a ketene ion or a secondary ion. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage product, like the loss of something from the main molecule.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about possible functional groups in each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygen atoms. Possibility of an ester or a ketone and an alcohol. Let's say it's an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. The IR would show a carbonyl around 1700, which matches. But an ester doesn't have an O-H group, unless it's a free alcohol, but then the formula would have more O. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, a lactone, which would have a carbonyl but no free O-H. So the FTIR broad peak would suggest an O-H elsewhere. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, a carboxylic acid would have O2 (if it's RCOOH), which would fit C6H10O2 if the formula is RCOOH with 5 other carbons. But wait, RCOOH is Cn+1H2n+2O2. Wait, the formula C6H10O2 would be more like a diacid, but that might have more O. Alternatively, maybe a substituted carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows vinyl H, so double bond. The IR has a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Like something with a conjugated carbonyl and double bond. For example, something like methyl acrylate or similar.

Wait, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's calculate its formula: C4H6O2. But our options are for C6. So perhaps a larger molecule. Maybe an ester with a vinyl group.

Hmm. Let's think about the mass spec again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of that. So perhaps it's a cleavage product, like the loss of a larger fragment leaving a smaller one. Alternatively, the base peak could be from a common fragment.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think of possible structures. Maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's an aromatic compound with substituents. But the IR doesn't show strong aromatic C-H stretches. The broad peak at 3000 is more likely O-H. So maybe it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an O-H. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H, which would be for a double bond, perhaps in a ring like cyclohexene, but with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ester. For example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2OH. But that would have the formula C6H12O3, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester: like CH2CO-O-R. Hmm.

Another angle: the presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 and a carbonyl indicates perhaps an enol. Enols have an O-H and a conjugated double bond. So maybe the compound is an enol, which would have both a double bond and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, enols would have a conjugated double bond and a hydroxyl. So the IR would show the O-H stretch and the conjugated carbonyl (the C=O) around 1700, and the C=C might be around 1650. So that fits the IR data. The NMR shows vinyl H, which fits the double bond in the enol. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a cleavage product involving the enol group.

So if the compound is an enol, then the formula would be something like C6H10O2. Because enol structure is R-C-OH with a double bond adjacent. Let me think: for example, R-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CO-O-R' or something. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another thought: the degrees of unsaturation. For option C, C6H10O2: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds. If one is the double bond in the enol, the other could be a ring. Alternatively, another double bond elsewhere.

But in the NMR, the presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond. So the structure would have one double bond (enol) and another ring, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclopentenol derivative with an ester group. Not sure.

Let me think about the molecular formula and possible structures. Let's say it's an ester with a vinyl group. For example, a vinyl ester like CH2=CHCOO-R. But let's see, the formula would vary based on R.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a lactone with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester, but earlier thoughts don't point to that because the FTIR didn't show strong aromatic C-H peaks.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at the possible fragments again. The m/z 45 could be from a ketene ion. A ketene ion has the formula R-C=O, but I'm not sure exactly.

Another approach: the molecular formula options and their possible structures. Let's see:

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures include:
- An ester with a double bond (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester)
- A carboxylic acid with a double bond and another oxygen somewhere
- A ketone and an alcohol
- A cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond.

If it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, for example, that would have both a double bond (vinyl H) and a carbonyl (IR 1700). The 1650 peak could be the conjugated double bond.

The FTIR's broad peak at 3000 would suggest an O-H. Wait, but in an ester, there's no O-H unless it's a free alcohol. So perhaps the structure is an ester plus an alcohol, but that would mean O2, which matches.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2, which would require two oxygen atoms. So if the structure is an ester (O2), perhaps it's an ester plus an alcohol. But that would mean two O's. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R', which would have two O's in the ester group. So if it's a di-ester, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else with two O's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a gamma,delta-unsaturated beta-keto ester. Hmm, but that might be getting complicated.

Let me think again about the mass spec. The fragment at 45. So, possible that the fragment is (CH2)2CO+ which is 58? No, that's 58. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. For example, CH2CH2COO- would be 60. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe a CH3COO group? That would be 59 (43 being CH3CO+), but the fragment is 45.

Wait, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 30 (for (CH3)2O is 30?), no, (CH3)2O is (15*2) + 16=30 +16=46? Wait, wait, (CH3)2O is (2*15) +16)=46? Because CH3 is 15, so two CH3 groups plus O (16) would be 46. So 46, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the fragment is (CH2)2CO+, which is 58. No, that's higher than 45.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be the mass of a formyl group (CHO) plus something else. CHO is 30. Maybe CH2CHO? That would be 59. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O fragment. CH2CH2O is 44 (12*2 + 4 + 16= 24+4+16=44). So that's 44, but the fragment is 45. Close. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2O+ with a hydrogen attached, but that would be 45.

Wait, (CH2)2O has a mass of 44, so a fragment of (CH2)2O+ would be 44. But the peak is at 45. Hmm, maybe including a hydrogen somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is HCOOCH2, which is 59 again.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methylene group attached to something else. I'm not getting this.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl ester, and the fragment is from the methyl group. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula of the compound. Let's say the correct formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of that. Maybe the molecule breaks off into a 45 fragment and a 69 fragment (since 45 +69=114). So perhaps the molecule cleaves into two parts.

Alternatively, the molecule could lose a larger fragment, leaving 45.

Wait, for example, if the molecule is an ester like RCOOR', and it breaks to form RCOO+ (fragment at 45?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2O (but that's too many O's). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 45 fragment is from a CH2CH2CO group. Let me calculate: CH2CH2CO is 58 (12*3 + 2*5 + 16*1=36+10+16=62? Wait, no, CH2CH2CO is CH2CH2CO, which is CH2CH2CO has molecular formula C3H4O. The molar mass is 3*12 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, which is 44. So perhaps the actual fragment is 45, which is 44 plus a hydrogen. Maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O with a hydrogen attached, making it 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO group minus a hydrogen. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. For example, in an ester R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could produce R-O-CO+, which would have a mass equal to R-O-CO. But without knowing R, it's hard to tell.

Wait, maybe the 45 is from a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44. Could it be a CH2CH2O with an extra H? Maybe it's part of a larger structure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the options again based on the functional groups.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), and peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (maybe conjugated C=C). So the compound likely has both a carbonyl and a double bond, and an O-H group.

Looking at the options, which options have O2?

Options A and C. So, options A is C6H12O2 and C is C6H10O2.

Option A: C6H12O2. So, DoU is 1. So one ring or double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond. So this would fit if the compound has a double bond and an O2 group.

But then, what would the O2 be? It could be an ester or a ketone and an alcohol. If it's an ester, the structure would have O2 but no O-H, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad O-H peak, which suggests an -OH group. So the compound must have an -OH.

So, possible structures with O2 and an -OH:

- An ester and an alcohol: but that would mean two oxygen-containing groups. For example, a molecule with both an ester group and an alcohol group.

But would that fit the molecular formula? For C6H12O2, which is C6H12O2. If the molecule is something like a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alcohol, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, perhaps it's a hemiacetal. Hemiacetals have one O. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the compound could be a beta-keto alcohol. So a ketone and an alcohol in the same molecule. So, for example, (CH2)4COH-CO-CH2. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, if the structure is a beta-keto alcohol, then the formula would be CnH2nO2. Let's see for n=5: C5H10O2. But the options are C6H12O2 (A) and C6H10O2 (C).

Wait, for n=6, H would be 12 for a beta-keto alcohol, which would fit option A. So, a six-carbon beta-keto alcohol would have the formula C6H12O2.

But then in that case, the IR would show a peak around 1700 for the ketone, and the O-H around 3000. The NMR would have vinyl Hs if there's a double bond somewhere. Wait, but a beta-keto alcohol doesn't necessarily have a double bond. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, if the structure is a cyclohexenol with a ketone group. For example, a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol. That would have a double bond (vinyl H), a ketone (1700), and an O-H (3000). The formula would be C6H10O2 (since cyclohexene is C6H10, with two O's for the ketone and alcohol). So that would fit option C.

So, if the structure is a cyclohexenol derivative with a ketone group, that would explain the IR, NMR, and FTIR data. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a cleavage product involving the ketone or the ring.

Alternatively, another way to approach this: let's think about the molecular ion. The molecular formula options are:

A: C6H12O2 → 116 g/mol

B: C6H10O → 98

C: C6H10O2 → 114

D: C6H12O → 100

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. So the molecular ion must be higher than 45. All options are higher. So that doesn't help much.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula can be determined by the number of rings and double bonds. Let's recount.

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU =1. So either a ring or a double bond. But NMR shows vinyl H, which is a double bond. So that's possible. But then the O2 would be from a ketone and an alcohol or an ester. But an ester doesn't have an O-H. Alternatively, a beta-keto alcohol.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU=2. So one double bond (from vinyl H) and one ring. That fits, for example, a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol.

So, considering all this, which options fit the data?

The presence of a broad O-H peak suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid would have a strong O-H peak, and the IR would show a broad peak around 2500-3300. But in the question, the broad peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical for an alcohol, but possible.

The other IR peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (probably conjugated C=C). So the structure has both a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond.

Option C's structure of a cyclohexene ring (double bond) with a ketone and an alcohol would fit. The vinyl H in the NMR would come from the double bond in the ring. The IR peaks would be from the ketone (1700) and the conjugated double bond (1650). The O-H from the alcohol would give the broad peak at 3000.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a cleavage involving the carbonyl group. For example, if the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, the fragment could be a smaller piece. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Putting it all together, the most likely formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound's spectroscopic data provides the following insights:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond (C=C), respectively.

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a common cleavage product, possibly involving a carbonyl group or a smaller fragment.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:  
  - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1, indicating one ring or double bond.  
  - The NMR data shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. However, this option does not account for the conjugated system implied by the IR data (1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹).  

- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:  
  - DoU = 2, suggesting two rings or double bonds.  
  - While this option could explain the presence of a double bond, it lacks the second functional group required to match the IR data (e.g., a carbonyl group).  

- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:  
  - DoU = 2, which can account for one double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) and one ring.  
  - The IR data aligns well: the carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and conjugated double bond (1650 cm⁻¹). The broad O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an alcohol.  
  - The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 can be explained by a cleavage involving the carbonyl group or a smaller fragment.  

- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:  
  - DoU = 1, indicating one ring or double bond.  
  - While this option could explain the presence of a double bond, it does not account for the second functional group required to match the IR data (e.g., a carbonyl group).

### Conclusion:
The most consistent explanation for the data is a compound with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the observed IR peaks (carbonyl and conjugated double bond), the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens), and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45. A plausible structure is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone and an alcohol group.
