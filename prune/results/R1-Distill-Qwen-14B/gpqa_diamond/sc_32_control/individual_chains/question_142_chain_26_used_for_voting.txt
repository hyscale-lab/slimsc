Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully.

The question gives a density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of states) rather than a pure state.

Hmm, I think the first step is to figure out what this particular ρ represents. Let's write out the matrices for |0><0| and |1><1|. The |0> state is [1; 0], so |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is [0 0; 0 1]. So when I add them together, I get a matrix that's [1, 0; 0, 1]. Then I multiply by 1/2, so ρ becomes (1/2)*[[1,0],[0,1]] = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any single-qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector of length ≤1 and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

So ρ can be rewritten in that form. Let me equate the two expressions: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. But what is r here? Let's rearrange: 2ρ = I + r·σ. Subtracting I from both sides gives r·σ = 2ρ - I. 

Plugging in the values, 2ρ is [[1,0],[0,1]], since 2*(0.5) is 1 for each diagonal. So 2ρ - I is [[1,0],[0,1]] - [[1,0],[0,1]] = [[0,0],[0,0]], which is the zero matrix. That means r·σ is zero. 

The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. For this sum to be zero, each coefficient must be zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z=0. Therefore, r is the zero vector (0,0,0). 

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Wait a second, does this make sense? Because the density matrix ρ is a completely mixed state. In a single qubit system, the completely mixed state is indeed at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere describes pure states on its surface, and any mixture like this would be in the center. So yes, option C is correct.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding this, the matrices for \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right|\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\) are \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), respectively. Adding these and multiplying by \(\frac{1}{2}\), we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a completely mixed state. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch sphere representation as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector with \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\), and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Rearranging, we have:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 2\rho - I.
\]

Substituting \(\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}\), we find \(2\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), and thus:

\[
2\rho - I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This implies \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which means all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the Bloch sphere is the origin, corresponding to the completely mixed state.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) r=(1,1,0)**  
**B) r=(0,0,1)**  
**C) r=(0,0,0)**  
**D) r=(1,1,1)**  

The correct choice is **C) r=(0,0,0)**.
