Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. I've studied some coordination chemistry before, so I hope that helps.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, so the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2−. The stability constant βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. The blue complexes are the dithiocyanato ones, which I think means the Co with two SCN ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2- complex, which would correspond to β2=40.

I remember that when you have multiple complexes possible, you can model the distribution of the metal between different complexes using the stability constants. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the complex species.

So, the general approach is to consider all possible complexes: Co^2+ (free ion), [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Each of these has a certain concentration based on the stability constants.

The key is to calculate the fraction of Co that is in each complex and then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato complex.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit off because β usually increases with the number of ligands, but here β4 is smaller than β3. Hmm, maybe I'm remembering it wrong. Oh, but the maximum stability is at β3, so the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^-. Interesting.

The problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the second complex.

I think the way to approach this is using the formation of each complex step by step. Let's denote the concentration of each complex as [CoL_n], where L is SCN^-.

The formation of each complex step can be considered. The total concentration of Co is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoL] + [CoL2] + [CoL3] + [CoL4] = 1e-2 M.

But wait, actually, the problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So all the Co is in these complexes plus any other forms, but the given complexes must account for all Co species.

So, the idea is to model the distribution of Co among the different complexes, considering their stability constants.

The general approach is to use the stability constants to find the fractions. The fraction of Co in each complex can be determined by the ratio of their respective terms in the distribution equation.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex is given by (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (sum for m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^m ), multiplied by [Co^2+], but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, let me think again. The stability constant for each complex is defined as β_n = [CoL_n]/([Co^2+][L]^n). So [CoL_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [L]^n.

So, each [CoL_n] is proportional to β_n [L]^n. Because [Co^2+] is the same in each expression, the ratio of [CoL_n] to [CoL_m] is (β_n [L]^n)/(β_m [L]^m) ) = (β_n/β_m) [L]^{n-m}.

But since all the [CoL] terms depend on [Co^2+], which is a variable here, perhaps we can express each [CoL_n] in terms of [Co^2+] and the β and [L] values.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:

[CoL_0] = x (n=0)
[CoL_1] = β1 x [SCN]
[CoL_2] = β2 x [SCN]^2
[CoL_3] = β3 x [SCN]^3
[CoL_4] = β4 x [SCN]^4

But wait, no. The general formula is [CoL_n] = β_n x [L]^n.

So, the sum of all [CoL_n] plus the free [Co^2+] equals the total Co concentration.

Wait no, the total Co is the sum of all the complexes plus any other species. But in this case, the only species are the complexes and Co^2+. So,

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [CoL_1] + [CoL_2] + [CoL_3] + [CoL_4] = 1e-2 M.

But wait, no. Because [CoL_0] is the free Co^2+ itself, so perhaps [CoL_0] = x, and the rest are the complexes. But in the standard approach, the complexes are [CoL], [CoL2], etc., so perhaps:

Total Co = x + β1 x [L] + β2 x [L]^2 + β3 x [L]^3 + β4 x [L]^4} = 1e-2 M.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing the terms. The stability constants are defined as:

β_n = [CoL_n]/([Co^2+][L]^n).

So, [CoL_n] = β_n [Co^2+][L]^n.

So, the sum over all n of [CoL_n] + [Co^2+] = total Co.

Wait, [Co^2+] is a separate term, so:

x (1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4 ) = c_total.

So, x = c_total / (1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4 )

Once we find x, which is [Co^2+], we can find each [CoL_n].

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2). So, the fraction f2 is [CoL_2] / (x + [CoL_1] + [CoL_2] + [CoL_3] + [CoL_4}).

Alternatively, because the total is x + sum [CoL_n], which equals c_total, the fraction of each complex is [CoL_n]/c_total.

So, [CoL_2] = β2 x [L]^2, and [CoL_2]/c_total = (β2 x [L]^2) / c_total.

But x is c_total divided by (1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4).

Putting it all together:

([CoL_2]/c_total) = (β2 [L]^2 * x ) / c_total.

But x = c_total / (denominator), so:

([CoL_2]/c_total) = (β2 [L]^2 * (c_total / denominator)) ) / c_total.

The c_total cancels out, so:

([CoL_2]/c_total) = (β2 [L]^2) / denominator.

Where denominator is 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

So, the fraction is (β2 [L]^2) / (sum of terms), which are β_n [L]^n for n=0 to 4, where β_0 is 1 (since [CoL_0] = x = β_0 x [L]^0 = x).

Wait, the denominator is 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

So, let's compute the denominator:

Given [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

n=0: 1

n=1: β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: β2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

n=3: β3 [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

n=4: β4 [SCN]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So denominator = 2.3646.

Then, the fraction for [CoL_2] is (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So, that's approximately 16.9%. Wait, but that's the fraction of [CoL_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex. So the percentage is about 16.9%, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, let me double-check the math.

Denominator:

n=0: 1

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 → total 1.9

n=2: 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 → total 2.3

n=3:63 * 0.001= 0.063 → 2.363

n=4:16 * 0.0001=0.0016 → 2.3646.

Yes, that's correct.

So, [CoL_2] fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but the options have option D as 16.9%, which matches this.

So, the correct answer is D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

The fraction of cobalt in each complex is determined by the ratio of the formation constants and the thiocyanate concentration. The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) is given by:

\[
\text{Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0} = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

where the denominator is:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \),
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \),
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \),
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \),
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \),

the denominator becomes:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
\text{Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is:

\[
0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

The correct answer is:
