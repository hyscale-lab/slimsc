Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. So the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's interesting because 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature? Or wait, no, k*T is actually the thermal energy. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), which affects the population ratio.

The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that of star 2. I think the ratio of populations would be n1/n2 = 2. And the ratio according to the Boltzmann factor is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since it's the same transition for both stars, g1 and g2 (the statistical weights) would be the same, so they cancel out. So n1/n2 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T2) ) ) = exp[ (E2 - E1)( (1/(k T2)) - (1/(k T1)) ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me re-express it. The population ratio between two energy levels is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Here, since star_1 has higher excitation, maybe E is higher? Or wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The ratio is n_high / n_low = (g_high/g_low) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_high - E_low. In star_1, the excitation is higher, so n_high/n_low for star_1 is higher than that of star_2. So for star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is proportional to the population of the higher state. So n1_high/n1_low * g1 = 2 * (n2_high/n2_low * g2). But since it's the same transition, the g factors are same, so n1_high/n1_low = 2 * (n2_high/n2_low).

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of atoms in the excited state is higher in star_1 than star_2. So (n1_high)/(n1_total) = 2 * (n2_high)/(n2_total). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should model it as the ratio between the two stars.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n_high)/(n_low) = (g_high/g_low)*exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

Similarly, R2 = (n_high)/(n_low) = (g_high/g_low)*exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So,

R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T2) ] - [ΔE/(k T1)] )

Because R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

So,

ln(R1/R2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

We know R1/R2 = 2.

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, let's see: 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes.

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. The Boltzmann constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something? Let me compute ΔE/k.

ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. Oh! So ΔE/k is 1 K.

So,

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). That matches exactly.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. So because R1 = 2 R2, then R1/R2 = 2. Then the ratio is 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Taking ln gives ln 2 = (ΔE/k)( (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, no, because in R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), so R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Which is the same as what I had earlier.

So that gives ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) )

Since ΔE/k is 1, it's ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D says exactly that: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2). So D is the correct answer.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature of the system.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \frac{g_{\text{high}}}{g_{\text{low}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{high}} \) and \( g_{\text{low}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the problem specifies that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, the ratio of the population ratios is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 2,
\]

where \( R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} \) for star_1 and \( R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} \) for star_2. Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star, the ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
