Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and it has a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. It also mentions that l and L are greater than R, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Wait, I think I should visualize this setup. Imagine the main conductor sphere, and inside it, somewhere off-center, there's a smaller cavity. The charge q is inside this cavity. The point P is outside the conductor, so its position is beyond the conductor's surface.

I remember that when a cavity inside a conductor has a charge, the conductor will redistribute charges. But wait, since the conductor was initially uncharged, how does the charge distribution work?

Oh right! The conductor was uncharged, so initially, it's neutral. When charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces must balance. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor's material must cancel the electric field within the conductor itself. The outer surface then must have a charge of +q to maintain neutrality, but wait, no, the conductor was initially neutral, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. So, the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface must be +q to balance it out.

Wait, no, wait. If the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge on the conductor is zero (since it was uncharged).

But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So the total charge on it is zero. The charge inside must induce a charge of -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, the sum must be zero: inner is -q, outer is +q.

But wait, no. The conductor's net charge is zero. So the inner surface has induced charge -q, and the outer surface has +q because the net charge of the conductor is zero. Oh wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is zero, so the sum of inner and outer must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q. So net charge of conductor is (-q) + (+q) = 0, which fits.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So, the electric field at P is due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the inner surface charges (-q) are inside the conductor and thus their fields don't affect points outside, according to Gauss's law.

Wait, but the outer surface charge is +q, so the field outside the conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the field outside is the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity, but the outer surface is still a sphere, so the charge distribution is spherically symmetric. Thus, for any point outside, the field is as if the charge is at the center.

So the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

But wait, let me think again. The charge in the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface, and +q on the outer surface. So the net charge outside is +q. Since P is outside the conductor, it's as if the charge +q is at the center, and the field is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The charge is inside the cavity, and the conductor was initially uncharged. So the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. So the point outside feels a field as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the question says that the point P's distance from the center of the cavity is l, and the angle θ is between l and s. How does that come into play here?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the charge is placed in the cavity, which is off-center. So the induced charges on the conductor's inner surface would be -q, but are they uniformly distributed? I think in a conductor, the charges rearrange to make the electric field inside the conductor zero.

If the cavity's center is offset from the conductor's center by s, then the inner surface's charge distribution might not be uniform. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is offset. So the inner surface's charge might be non-uniform but arranged such that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but in that case, the field outside the conductor would depend on the distribution of the outer surface's charge. If the conductor was a perfect sphere, the outer surface would have uniform charge distribution, leading to the same field as a point charge at the center. But if the conductor is not a perfect sphere, perhaps its charge distribution is affected by the position of the cavity.

Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface remains spherical because the conductor is a sphere, but the inner surface is not; it's the shape of the cavity? No, the inner surface of the conductor is a sphere with radius R. Wait, no, the cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor itself is a sphere of radius R, so the inner surface is a sphere of radius R. But the cavity is a smaller sphere of radius r, with its center displaced by s from the conductor's center.

In that case, the inner surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius R, but the charge induced on it would be -q, but distributed non-uniformly because the cavity's charge is at an offset.

Wait, but how does that affect the outer surface's charge distribution? The outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so because the conductor is spherical, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. Because regardless of the inner cavity's position, the outer surface of a conducting sphere would be uniformly charged when it's a conductor.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed regardless of the inner cavity's charge position. Because the conductor's own shape is spherical.

So, the outer surface's charge is +q, uniformly distributed. So the field outside is as if the charge were at the center.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, so the field would be (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², as in option B.

So why are the other options present? Let's look at the other options.

Option A: 1/(4πε₀) q/(l - s cosθ)^2. That seems like it's considering the displacement of the charge inside the cavity, but since the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, the field outside should only depend on L.

Option C: l + s cosθ, squared. That doesn't seem right either.

Option D: 1/(4πε₀) q/l². That would be the case if the charge were at the center of the cavity, but the field outside the conductor is not affected by the inner displacement.

Wait, no. The field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is uniformly distributed, so the field depends only on L, the distance from the conductor's center.

So the correct answer would be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the charge distribution and the setup:

1. **Charge Distribution**:  
   The conductor is initially neutral. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field within the conductor). The outer surface of the conductor, being a spherical surface, must then have a uniform charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside a conducting sphere depends only on the total charge on its outer surface and the distance from the center of the sphere. Since the outer surface has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Field at Point $P$**:  
   The distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$ is $L$. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Other Parameters**:  
   The parameters $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ (the distance from the cavity's center to $P$, the offset between the cavity's and conductor's centers, and the angle between $l$ and $s$, respectively) do not affect the field at $P$ because the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform and spherically symmetric. The field outside the conductor depends only on $L$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ does not describe the distance over which the field propagates outside the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is unrelated to the field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. This expression assumes the field depends on $l$, the distance from the cavity's center to $P$, which is not relevant outside the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
