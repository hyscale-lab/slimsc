Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about the geometric position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in an ensemble of states.

Wait, I think I should first recall what the density matrix looks like for a qubit. A qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a, b, c, d are elements. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute that. |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together would give [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 0.5.

I remember that for a qubit, the density matrix can also be represented in the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent the state of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the expression becomes ρ = [I + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)] / 2.

In our case, the given ρ is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. Let's compare this with the general form. Expanding [I + r·σ]/2, I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when we add r·σ, each Pauli matrix contributes. Let me compute each term:

r_x σx = r_x [[0,1],[1,0]]
r_y σy = r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]]
r_z σz = r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Adding them all and then adding I (which is [[1,0],[0,1]]), then dividing by 2.

So when we add I + r·σ, we get:
Top left: 1 + r_z
Top right: r_x - i r_y
Bottom left: r_x + i r_y
Bottom right: 1 - r_z

Then dividing each element by 2 gives the matrix ρ.

So comparing this with the given ρ which is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal. That implies that the off-diagonal elements are zero because in the given ρ, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are zero.

Looking at our expression, the off-diagonal terms are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2. For these to be zero, both (r_x - i r_y) and (r_x + i r_y) must be zero.

Wait, more accurately, since in the given ρ the off-diagonal terms are zero, that means (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 and (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0. That implies that both r_x = 0 and r_y = 0 because if you have (r_x - i r_y) = 0, that means r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because for the complex number (r_x) + (-i r_y) to be zero, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. So r_x=0, and r_y=0.

Now looking at the diagonal elements. The (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5, and the (2,2) element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5.

So setting (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5: Multiply both sides by 2, 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z=0.

Wait, that can't be right because if r_z is zero, then 1 + 0 =1, so 1/2=0.5, which is correct. So r_z is zero. So the Bloch vector r has components (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0,0,0). That would place the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because it's completely mixed. Because, for a pure state, the Bloch vector has length 1, but a completely mixed state (like this one) is represented by r=0.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches. Another way to think about this: the given density matrix is a completely mixed state because it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )/2, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. The maximally mixed state has no coherence and is at the center of the Bloch sphere. So yes, the position is (0,0,0), so the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

In the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit state is described by a Bloch vector **r** = (r_x, r_y, r_z), and the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given density matrix, the off-diagonal elements (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2 must be zero, which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). For the diagonal elements, the conditions \((1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5\) and \((1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5\) lead to \( r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0), which corresponds to the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is **r** = (0, 0, 0).
