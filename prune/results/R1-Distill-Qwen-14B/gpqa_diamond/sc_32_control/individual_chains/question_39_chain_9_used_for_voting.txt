Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So none are found outside that range. The question is asking for the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. And since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this region must be zero. But wait, the wave function is given for a part of space where the particle can exist. So maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3?

Wait, no, the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But that's in a part of space where the particle can exist. Considering that when measurements are made, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside this interval, but the given expression is valid inside. Or maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. But wait, the way the question is phrased says that the wave function is described as this in the part of space where it can exist, which implies that ψ(x) is zero elsewhere. So perhaps the wave function is zero for x < 1 and x > 3, and given by (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3.

Wait, but in reality, wave functions are usually defined in regions, and the normalization condition must hold. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute the modulus squared of this. The modulus squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)² ] because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must be equal to 1. Because the particle is confined between 1 and 3, and the wave function is zero outside, the integral over all space must be 1.

Wait, but wait a second. If the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i only where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere, then the probability distribution is |ψ(x)|² between 1 and 3, and zero outside.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let me compute this integral.

Compute integral [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Let me split this into two integrals:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

First integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again. Wait, wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|^2, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, right? Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part, and (-0.5) is the imaginary part. So that's correct.

So the integral becomes [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Integrating a²/(1+x) gives a² ln(1+x). So from 1 to 3, it's a² ln(4) - a² ln(2) ) = a² ln(2), which is correct.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² = (1 - 0.5)/ ln(2) = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Square root of that is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So the answer is option B, 0.85.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the exact steps again. Because sometimes I might make a mistake in the integral.

Wait, the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So a² times that from 1 to 3 is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). Correct.

So the equation a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let me compute 0.5 divided by ln(2).

ln(2) is approximately 0.693147.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

Square root of that: sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849. So approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

A) 1.1

B) 0.85

C) 0.35

D) 0.6

So the correct answer should be option B, 0.85. So that's the choice.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability must integrate to 1:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we split the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding the results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **option B**.
