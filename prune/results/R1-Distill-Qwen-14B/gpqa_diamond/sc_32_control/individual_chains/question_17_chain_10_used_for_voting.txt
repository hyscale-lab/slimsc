Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ forming a complex. The formation constant (K) tells us how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so less Ca²+ ions will be free in solution.

Wait, what's the setup here? The problem says it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, so each molecule of EDTA binds one Ca²+ ion. So the formula of the complex would be something like CaEDTA^2- or similar, but the exact charge might not matter here.

Since it's a 1:1 complex, when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (since EDTA is usually in the Y^4- form when deprotonated, which is the case under ideal pH conditions). The reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-
And the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, no, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex, so it's the reverse of the dissociation. So the K for formation is 5e10. So the dissociation would have a K of 1/(5e10), which is 2e-11.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of calcium ions when the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So let's denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M. And we need to find [Ca²+].

Assuming that the solution is such that the complex doesn't dissociate much. Wait, no, the formation constant is high, so the complex is stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very low.

But wait, in this case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial assumption is that the complex doesn't dissociate, so the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be negligible. But wait, that can't be right, because the problem is asking for the concentration of Ca²+.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is in a state where the complex has dissociated a little. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. Let's model the dissociation. Let me write the dissociation equation:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, so the dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]

In the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M (assuming that's the initial concentration, and any dissociation is x). Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- formed from dissociation.

So [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M, since x is very small because Kd is tiny.

Then, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x.

Substituting into Kd's expression:

Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait 4e-13 is 4*1e-13, so sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Hmm, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with formation constants, the assumption is that the concentration of the complex is determined by the initial concentration, so we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as approximately 0.02 M.

So the calculation would be Kd = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7, which is option C.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Alternatively, let's think about it another way. If the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and K is very large, the complex is mostly undissociated, so the free Ca²+ concentration is very low, which aligns with the calculation.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions that dissociate from the complex. The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \quad \text{(since \( x \) is very small)},
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the expression for \( K_d \):

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
