Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when certain acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The general formula for such reactions is acid + base → salt + water, and the process is exothermic, so the enthalpy change is negative.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait—HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they're mixed, they'll react together.

I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base because the reaction depends on the limiting reagent. Let's break it down step by step.

First, calculating the moles of each solution.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so for each solution, I can find moles by multiplying Molarity by Volume (in liters).

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole gives one H+ ion.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+ ions. So that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole gives two OH- ions. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, the reaction is between H+ and OH-. The total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, the H+ is in excess because 0.28 > 0.2. The OH- is the limiting reagent. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

The neutralization reaction will produce water. The amount of heat released depends on the moles of OH- that react because each mole of OH- reacting contributes to the enthalpy change.

Wait, but wait. I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting. But I also need to consider the stoichiometry here.

Wait, each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of H+ to form water. So in this case, 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the total H+ from the acids is 0.28. The OH- is 0.2, so only 0.2 moles of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

But wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ/mol, but wait, wait: no, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). Because each mole releases that much heat.

But wait, the exact value is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), because each mole of acid reacting with a mole of base releases that amount. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically around -57 kJ per mole for a strong acid and a strong base. So that's per mole of H+ reacting. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, you get about -57 kJ.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the exact enthalpy value. Hmm, so perhaps I should use the given options to figure it out, but I think I might have to proceed with the standard value.

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's outline the steps.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from each acid.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from the base.
3. Determine which is the limiting reagent (the smaller quantity will limit the reaction).
4. Calculate the moles of H+ that actually react with OH-.
5. Multiply by the enthalpy per mole to find the total enthalpy change.

So:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. Since OH- is less, it's the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of OH- will react, each with a mole of H+.

So moles reacted: 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

The moles of water formed are 0.2 mol, and the remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

Now, the enthalpy change is calculated as the moles of H+ (or OH-) reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

Assuming the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), each mole of H+ that reacts contributes -57 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options are given in kcal and kJ. Let's see the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal → around -11.4 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ → 2.72 kcal is about 11.4 kJ)
B) -11.42 kcal → roughly -48.2 kJ
C) -3.80 kcal → about -15.8 kJ
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, I calculated -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the exact value of enthalpy.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't just H+ + OH- → H2O, but maybe considering the salts formed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so the two H+ ions both contribute to the enthalpy.

Wait, wait. When H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, how does that go? Let me think about the reaction.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when it reacts with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but let's write the molecular equation.

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

Breaking into ions:

H+ + H+ + SO4^2- + Ba^2+ + 2 OH- → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

So the reaction involves two H+ ions from H2SO4 and two OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 moles of H+.

Similarly, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-.

So for each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reacting, 2 moles of H+ and 2 moles of OH- combine, producing 2 moles of water.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization for each mole of H+ is about -57 kJ. So 2 moles would be -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but this complicates things because the initial approach considered all H+ from both acids reacting, but perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry of each acid and base combination.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- separately, regardless of the source, and then find the neutralization.

Hmm, perhaps that's the better approach. So going back, the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction is between 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

The limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 mol). So 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH- will react to form 0.2 mol H2O.

The enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately equal to -11.4 kJ because 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). But wait, the sign is negative, so it's -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me calculate 11.4 kJ in kcal.

Since 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal (because 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ → 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈0.239 kcal). So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * 0.239 ≈2.72 kcal. So negative would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought the answer was -11.4 kJ, which would be option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, but the calculation gave me -11.4 kJ, but none of the options in kJ match except D is -16, which is not close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ and OH- to be considered, but perhaps using a different value.

Wait, maybe I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H+ ions, each of which releases 57 kJ. But wait, no, because the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, each H+ contributes -57 kJ.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the minimum, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

So, total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking for the option that says -11.4 kJ. But options are in either kcal or kJ.

Option D says -16.0 kJ, which is more than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the moles again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, yes, OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 OH- react.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) → -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, which one is -11.4 kJ? Let's see:

Option D is -16.0 kJ. No. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ (since 11.4 kJ ≈2.72 kcal, but wait, 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. So option B is -11.42 kcal which is about -48.2 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me calculate 11.4 kJ into kcal.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, the calculation gives me -11.4 kJ, which is equivalent to -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but looking back, the problem is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three are mixed. But wait, perhaps I should consider the neutralization of all H+ and OH-.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the three solutions are mixed. So perhaps the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles, and from H2SO4, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles. Total H+ is 0.28.

The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So, as per the options, the closest would be option D, which is -16.0 kJ. But wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different enthalpy value.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57.3 kJ/mol H+.

Wait, 57.3 kJ is about 13.72 kcal. So 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps considering the individual reactions.

HCl and Ba(OH)2 reaction:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But HCl is monoprotic, Ba(OH)2 is diprotic. So the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 requires 2 moles of HCl.

HCl: 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles.

So for 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, need 0.2 moles HCl.

But HCl is only 0.1 moles available. So HCl is the limiting reagent here. So, 0.1 moles HCl will react with 0.05 moles Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but this complicates the situation because H2SO4 is also present.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization can be considered as the sum of the individual neutralizations between HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of total H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and moles of OH- from the base, then find the minimum and proceed.

Which is what I did earlier.

So, the correct calculation is 0.2 moles H+ reacting, leading to -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, the only one that matches this is option B as -11.42 kcal (which is about -48.2 kJ, which is way off). So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of acid or base, not per mole of H+.

Wait, maybe the standard enthalpy of neutralization is written per mole of acid (like for HCl, it's -57 kJ per mole). But in this case, I have multiple acids and a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and multiply by the enthalpy per mole of H+.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH = -n * 57 kJ, where n is the moles of H+ that react.

So n = min(0.28, 0.2) = 0.2.

ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ, which doesn't fit. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 11.4 kJ in kcal.

11.4 kJ = 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is approximately -3.81 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 OH-.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, so the calculation seems right. So why are the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but only the first dissociation is complete. Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the second H+ isn't as strong. Wait, but in aqueous solution, the first H+ is fully ionized, and the second is partially. But in this case, when considering neutralization, it's better to treat both H+ from H2SO4 as available, since the problem states that it's a strong acid.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and releases two OH- per formula unit.

So the total H+ is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to make us realize that the total neutralization is 0.2 moles, so the heat released is -0.2 * 57 = -11.4 kJ, which is option D, but D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, no, option D is -16 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H2SO4.

Wait, 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Each mole gives two H+, so 0.18 H+.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the use of a different enthalpy value, such as -57.3 kJ/mol H2O formed. Because sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is expressed as per mole of water formed.

Wait, no, wait. Each mole of H+ + OH- → 1 mole of H2O. So per mole of H2O, the enthalpy change is -57.3 kJ.

So if 0.2 moles of H2O are formed, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options again:

Option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let's compute what that is in kJ.

-11.42 kcal *4.184 kJ/kcal ≈-47.75 kJ. Which is way higher than our calculation.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to include all the H+ from H2SO4 and HCl, but considering that not all H2SO4's H+ will be neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the approach is different. Let me think: the neutralization only occurs for the moles of OH- available.

So, moles of OH- = 0.2.

So, moles of H+ neutralized = 0.2.

These 0.2 moles can come from either HCl or H2SO4.

But which source does it come from first?

Wait, in the case of mixing multiple acids with a base, the strong acid (HCl) dissociates completely, and the diprotic acid (H2SO4) also donates both H+ (since it's strong).

So the H+ from HCl would be available first, perhaps, but no, that's not the case. The OH- will react with whichever H+ is available, regardless of the acid source.

So, the 0.2 OH- will react with 0.2 H+ from the total 0.28 available.

Which is correct.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (option A).

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \), which contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \), which contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \), which contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction between \( \text{H⁺} \) and \( \text{OH⁻} \) is \( 1:1 \). Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} < 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺} \), \( \text{OH⁻} \) is the limiting reagent.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for \( \text{H⁺} \) and \( \text{OH⁻} \) is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - Moles of \( \text{H⁺} \) reacting: \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Total enthalpy change: \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect, as it is approximately \( -48.2 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far from the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect, as it corresponds to approximately \( -16.4 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
