Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology techniques and genetics. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate by using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes, right? So in this case, the ligand and receptor are on the same vector.

The vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So mCherry and eGFP are fluorescent markers to track expression.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. And upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of a second gene in a bicistronic mRNA, especially when the first gene is translated via cap-dependent methods.

Wait, the vector has loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. The ligand is before a stop with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. Oh, right, because Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So when Cre is expressed, it should excise those stops. If the ligand is under CBA, maybe it's constitutively expressed, but the receptor is under a different promoter?

Wait, the vector is lox-Cre, so I think the idea is that in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed. So before Cre, the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor along with eGFP, but only if the stops are removed.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. After transfection, they did a Western blot. The blot uses total proteins, and the signal correlates with actin loading. So they're checking if the proteins are expressed.

But then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. So these mice have the bicistronic vector integrated into their genome. Then they crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under SOX10 control, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like the cells where the ligand and receptor are supposed to be active.

After the offspring are born, they look under a confocal microscope for fluorescence. But they don't see a green signal. eGFP is green, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, the options are about why there's no green. So what's going on?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that affect expression? The construct should still be expressed, just acting on nearby. Not sure if this explains no eGFP.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. So the construct isn't trafficking properly. But if the eGFP isn't at the cell surface, maybe it doesn't fluoresce. But the question says they didn't see a green signal when visualizing. But in the Western blot, they would detect the protein regardless of location. Wait, the Western blot uses total proteins, so if the protein is made, it should show up. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So maybe the Western blot showed expression, but in the mouse, they don't see eGFP.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. Then crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10-Cre would cause the loxP and lox2272 sites to be recombined, removing the stop cassettes. So in the offspring, the ligand and receptor should be expressed, with mCherry and eGFP.

But if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the construct wasn't properly excised. Or maybe the frame is wrong, so the receptor isn't expressed, but the eGFP is. Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the eGFP is not happening.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The ligand is first, then mCherry, but with a loxP stop. The receptor is after IRES, which allows for its translation. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't because of the stop cassette. But when Cre is present, like in the SOX10-Cre mice, it should excise the stops.

Wait, no, the ligand has a loxP stop, so when Cre is present, that stop is removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed. The receptor has a lox2272 stop. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites. Cre can recognize loxP, and another recombinase (like Dre) for lox2272. But in this scenario, the Cre would only cut loxP sites, not lox2272. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand expression. But the receptor's stop is under lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor would remain under the stop cassette, so it's not expressed.

Wait, that's a key point. The vector has the ligand ORF followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor is after IRES, and has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So when Cre is present, it will cut the loxP sites, removing the stop in front of the ligand, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 sites aren't cut by Cre, so the receptor would still have the stop. Therefore, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, and neither would eGFP.

Ah, so in this case, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would only remove the loxP stop. The lox2272 stop remains. So the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP. Hence, no green signal.

So which option explains this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, that's a reading frame issue. If the ORF is not in frame, the protein would be truncated or not made. But in this case, the stop is still present, so the receptor isn't expressed at all.

Alternatively, if the lox2272 stop isn't excised, the receptor ORF is not expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

Looking at the options again:

Option C says the enhancer is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is after IRES, which is a cis-acting element, but maybe the IRES isn't sufficient without another promoter. But in the vector design, the IRES should allow for internal ribosome entry, which is a way to have two genes in one mRNA. So the IRES is supposed to drive the receptor's expression after the ligand.

Wait, but if the lox2272 stop isn't excised, the receptor won't be expressed. So in the mouse, the Cre has only removed the loxP stop, allowing ligand expression. But the receptor is still blocked.

So the reason for no eGFP is that the receptor isn't expressed because its stop is still present.

Looking at the options, which option aligns with this?

Option B suggests the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the protein is made but not trafficked, so no fluorescence. But in the Western blot, they'd see the receptor. Since the question doesn't mention the Western blot results, we don't know if it's expressed.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would result in a truncated or nonfunctional protein, but I don't think that's the case here. The stop is still present, so the receptor isn't even made.

Option C is about enhancers. If the enhancer is missing, the promoters wouldn't work. But the ligand is under CBA, which doesn't require enhancers. The receptor is under IRES; perhaps without an enhancer, it's not expressed. But the presence of the IRES suggests that it's constitutive.

Wait, the IRES allows for translation without a cap. So perhaps the presence of the IRES is all that's needed. So if the stop is still in place, the receptor isn't made, regardless of the IRES.

So the main issue is that the lox2272 stop isn't being removed because Cre can't cut lox2272 sites. Only loxP stops are removed. So the receptor remains under the stop, so no eGFP.

So looking at the options, which one explains this? The options don't directly state this, but perhaps option D or C.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the control of the IRES. So when the vector is in the mice, and Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. But the receptor's stop is under lox2272, which isn't cut by Cre. So the receptor remains under the stop, so it's not expressed.

Thus, in the mice, the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't made, so no green signal.

So why didn't the Cre remove the receptor's stop? Because Cre targets loxP, not lox2272. So the construct design is such that only the ligand's stop is removed, not the receptor's.

But looking at the options, none directly state this. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Wait, no, the frame is correct. The issue is that the stop is present.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because the stop is present, the receptor isn't expressed, so the eGFP isn't either. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES is not functioning, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, let's think about the vector design. The ligand is followed by a stop cassette with loxP. The receptor is at the 3' end, with a stop cassette with lox2272, and then eGFP. So without Cre, the ligand is not expressed, but the receptor's stop is in place.

Wait, no, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed because the promoter is active, but the stop in the loxP cassette would stop it. Wait, no, the ligand ORF is followed by a loxP stop. So in the absence of Cre, the stop is in place. So the ligand isn't expressed.

Ah, no, wait. The loxP-stop is in the same direction as the ligand. So the promoter (CBA) is before the ligand, then the ligand ORF, then the stop with loxP. So without Cre, the stop is in place, so the ligand isn't expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the stop is excised, allowing the ligand to be expressed.

The receptor is after IRES. So the mRNA is ligand followed by IRES and receptor. But the receptor is followed by a lox2272 stop, so without the right recombinase, it's not expressed.

So in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous. Then they cross with SOX10-Cre. The Cre is expressed in the neural crest. So in those cells, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand expression. But the receptor's stop remains, so receptor isn't expressed.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the receptor's ORF isn't being translated. So when they look under the confocal, they only see mCherry (if the ligand is expressed), but not eGFP.

Wait, but the question says they didn't observe a green signal. So in the mouse, the eGFP is not expressed.

So the reason is that the receptor-eGFP construct is not expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't excised. But Cre can't cut lox2272 sites, only loxP.

So the issue is that the stop for the receptor isn't removed because the wrong recombinase is used.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine: Unlikely, as that's about function, not expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi: That's about trafficking, not expression.

C) Enhancer missing: If enhancer is missing, maybe expression is low, but the design uses CBA and IRES.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame: That would cause no protein, but the issue is the stop remains.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the bicistronic construct isn't working because the two ORFs are not correctly placed. For example, the IRES is after the receptor, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, no, the vector has the ligand first, then the stop, then the IRES, then the receptor and stop. So when the stop is removed by Cre, the ligand is expressed. The IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed from the same mRNA.

But in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre should only remove the ligand's stop (loxP), not the receptor's (lox2272). So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is not.

Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green.

Which option matches this? The reason is that the stop for the receptor is still present, so the receptor isn't expressed. But none of the options directly state this.

Wait, looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean a frame shift, leading to a nonfunctional or truncated protein. But why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the ORF is disrupted. But the question is why there's no signal at all.

Wait, perhaps the stop in the lox2272 cassette is preventing the receptor from being expressed. So the eGFP isn't made because the ORF is blocked. So the reason is that the stop remains, preventing expression.

But none of the options directly say that. So looking again, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the eGFP is not correctly in frame with the receptor. So when the stop is in place, nothing is expressed beyond it, including eGFP. But if the stop is removed, then if the ORF is correct, eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, perhaps in the vector, the receptor is placed in such a way that the eGFP is in a different reading frame. But that would be due to how the construct was built, not the Cre activity.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the stop is present, so the receptor isn't expressed. But how does that relate to the options?

Maybe the correct answer is D because the ORF of the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so even though the stop is removed, the protein isn't made correctly.

Wait, but in the question, the loxP is before the ligand, and lox2272 is before the receptor. So perhaps when Cre is present, only the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand expression, but the receptor's stop isn't removed, so it's still blocked.

But the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, which only removes the loxP sites.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop before the receptor isn't removed. But the options don't directly address that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP won't be expressed because the ORF is messed up. But in this case, the problem is that the stop is still present. So the eGFP isn't expressed for two reasons: stop remains, and possibly frame shift.

But the question says that the vector was designed with the receptor's ORF fused to eGFP. So the ORF should be correct. So perhaps the issue is that the stop isn't removed.

Wait, but without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the options don't directly state this, but among the given options, which is the best fit?

Hmm. Another angle: the IRES element is after the ligand, so in the absence of the stop, the receptor is expressed. But if the lox2272 stop is not removed, the receptor isn't expressed.

But the construct uses IRES, which is a way to have two proteins expressed from the same mRNA. So the presence of the stop would prevent that.

So if the stop is present, the IRES can't function because the mRNA is terminated.

So the reason for no eGFP is that the stop before the receptor is not removed, so the IRES can't function, and the receptor isn't expressed.

But the question is why didn't the Cre remove the stop?

Because the stops are different: loxP vs lox2272.

So in the mouse model, the Cre removes the loxP, allowing the ligand to be expressed, but not the lox2272, so receptor remains stopped.

So the correct answer is that the receptor's stop wasn't removed, but the options don't mention that.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let me think of the vector design again. The ligand is first, then a stop, then the IRES, then the receptor and eGFP with another stop.

In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so the ligand is expressed. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. But the stop after the receptor is still there, unless another recombinase is present (like Dre for lox2272). Without that, the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is present. Thus, the reason for no green is that the stop before the receptor isn't removed.

But none of the options directly address this.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.

But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter without needing an enhancer. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. So this seems unlikely.

Option B) receptor stuck in Golgi: Would require the protein to be made but not trafficked. But without expression, Western blot wouldn't show it. Since the question says the blot is proportional to actin, perhaps the proteins are present, but the eGFP isn't fluorescent.

Wait, but if the eGFP is not expressed, the Western blot would not show it. So if the Western blot was done before and the proteins were expressed, that's another issue.

Wait, the question says they tested the construct expression on Western blot after plasmid transfection. So the construct was transfected into astrocytes, and the blot showed expression. But when they made the mouse and crossed with SOX10-Cre, they didn't see eGFP.

So perhaps in the plasmid, the stops are removed in vitro, but in the mouse, the Cre doesn't remove both stops.

Wait, no. The plasmid is a bicistronic vector with the stops. Upon transfection, in the absence of Cre, the ligand's ORF is blocked, the receptor's ORF is blocked. But the construct is transfected into astrocytes, which don't express Cre, so the stops remain. But in the Western blot, they didn't see the proteins. But the question says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin, meaning the loading is correct, but perhaps the proteins aren't expressed.

Wait, maybe they found expression in the Western, so the construct is working in the plasmid. But when they make a transgenic mouse and use SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest, so the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand expression, but the receptor's stop remains.

Thus, in the mouse, the ligand is expressed (mCherry), but the receptor isn't (no eGFP).

But why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop remains. So the situation is that the ligand is expressed, but not the receptor.

But the question states that after crossing, they don't see a green signal. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option aligns with this? The correct reason is that the lox2272 stop wasn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't either.

But again, none of the options directly say that. So which option is the best fit?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the vector design, it should be correctly in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the ligand and mCherry in the same ORF, and the receptor and eGFP in another. So the stops are separate.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not functional, but that isn't one of the options.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the IRES is before the receptor, and without the stop being removed, the IRES can't function. So the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, the question is about why no green is seen. So the likely reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed, which is because the stop remains. But the options don't directly address this.

Wait, looking at the vector, the ligand is ORF 5' with mCherry, then a stop with loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF with eGFP and a stop with lox2272.

So in the presence of Cre, the loxP is cut, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

So the reason for no eGFP is that the stop isn't removed, but the options don't have this.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but in this case, the frame is correct. The stop is just present.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the IRES is positioned incorrectly, so the receptor isn't expressed. But again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the IRES after the receptor, which would prevent expression. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is such that the IRES is for the ligand, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D because the ORF wasn't correctly cloned, leading to no expression. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that both stops are only removed when Cre and Dre are present. But the question only uses Cre.

Hmmm. Considering all this, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, wait. Another thought: the vector is bicistronic, with the ligand and receptor each followed by their own stops. In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand expression. The receptor's stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Thus, in the mouse, only the ligand is expressed, not the receptor. Therefore, no eGFP.

So the reason is that the stop for the receptor isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the options don't directly say that, so perhaps the best fit is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF isn't correctly in frame.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is for the receptor, but without the stop being removed, the IRES can't function.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The answer is that the Cre wasn't able to remove the stop for the receptor, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly mention this.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the vector was designed correctly, so perhaps the stop is present, making the ORF not in frame.

Wait, but the stop is a stop codon, not a frame issue. So the presence of the stop would prevent translation beyond it, so the eGFP isn't made. So the reason is that the stop is present, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES is not functioning, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent markers mCherry and eGFP fused to their respective ORFs. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is positioned after an IRES element. The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The construct was introduced into a mouse model, and SOX10-Cre mice were used to excise the loxP-stop cassette. However, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A (ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship):** This option refers to the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The lack of fluorescence is unrelated to their paracrine interaction.

- **Option B (receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi):** This suggests a trafficking issue, but if the receptor-eGFP were expressed, it would still fluoresce, even if improperly trafficked. The absence of fluorescence indicates the protein is not being expressed, not just mislocalized.

- **Option C (enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing):** The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is positioned after an IRES, which should allow translation without a traditional enhancer. This makes the absence of an enhancer unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression.

- **Option D (receptor and eGFP are not in the frame):** If the receptor and eGFP ORFs are not in frame, the translation would produce a truncated or nonfunctional protein, resulting in no fluorescence. However, the primary issue in this scenario is that the lox2272-stop cassette remains intact, preventing receptor expression entirely. The absence of fluorescence is due to the receptor and eGFP not being expressed, not necessarily because they are out of frame.

The most likely reason for the lack of eGFP fluorescence is that the lox2272-stop cassette remains unexcised, preventing receptor expression. However, none of the options explicitly address this. Among the given options, **Option D** is the closest, as it indirectly relates to the failure of eGFP expression, even though the primary issue is the unexcised stop cassette.

Answer: D
