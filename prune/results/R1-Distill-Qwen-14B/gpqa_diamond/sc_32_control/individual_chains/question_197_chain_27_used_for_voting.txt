Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but maybe I need to think more about the starting material first.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretches or maybe N-H, but since the question is about organic compounds, probably O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, so maybe this is a carboxylic acid or an ester? But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000, which fits the first peak. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound probably has a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid), and an O-H group.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a really high chemical shift. Broad singlet suggests it's an -OH proton. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would show up around 10-12 ppm, so that fits. So this proton is probably from a COOH group.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets indicate two sets of protons in the aromatic region. The integration of 2H each suggests a disubstituted benzene ring, like 4-substituted. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like a methyl and something else. Wait, but wait, if there's a COOH group attached to the benzene, the substituents would be at the para positions. So positions 1 and 4 would have substituents? Or maybe 1 and 3? Hmm, but the substituents would be in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which is common in para-disubstituted rings.

Next, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, likely a CH group adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe a CH attached to a carbonyl? Or perhaps part of a branched chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe a CH2 group near an electronegative atom or part of a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating for 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. For example, -CH2-C(CH3)2? Or perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a terminal methyl group, like at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe something like CH2CH2CH3, but wait, the triplet would come from being next to a CH2 group.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring has a COOH group and another substituent. The NMR suggests that on the benzene ring, the substituents are at the para positions. So structure-wise, maybe it's 4-(something)benzoic acid. Looking at the options, options C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would fit if the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is probably a CH2CH2CH3. But then, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH2. So maybe it's part of a butyl group. Let's try to draw this.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, that would be a four-carbon chain with the branching on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Wait, how does that fit the NMR?

The 2.9 ppm multiplet is a 1H, which might be the CH in the sec-butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is -CH2-C(CH2CH3)H. So the structure would be benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group attached at the para positions.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's see the NMR signals for that:

The sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the benzene would be split into a triplet or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the NMR signals are:

At 2.9 ppm: 1H (maybe the CH of a sec-butyl group). The CH would be split into a multiplet because of the adjacent CH2 groups.

At 1.7 ppm: 2H, maybe the CH2 adjacent to the CH in the sec-butyl group. So the CH2 would be next to the CH, leading to a multiplet.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl. So the structure is benzene with COOH and a substituent like -CH2-C(CH3)2? No, wait, that's iso-butyl. Alternatively, it's a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no—that would be a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, wait. Wait, but butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, and sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3). Wait, no. Let me correct that. The structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that would be longer than four carbons. Alternatively, the correct structure is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, maybe that's iso-butyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I don't think that's the case. Let me think about the substituent again.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, along with the COOH group. So the structure is:

Benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is attached to the ring via a CH2 group. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group. Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me think: the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the branch is on the second carbon. So, it should be:

-CH2-C(CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, that would be an iso-butyl group. Wait, wait, let me get this right.

Butyl groups:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)2 (branch on second carbon)
sec-butyl: CH2CH2CH(CH3) (branch on third carbon? No, because butyl is four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the NMR data again.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a terminal methyl group, like in a CH2CH2CH3. So that would be a part of an ethyl group, perhaps.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH2, perhaps a methyl group attached to a branching point.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is a CH group. So maybe it's a CH connected to two CH2 groups.

Putting it all together, the substituent might be a sec-butyl group, which would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an iso-butyl group. Wait, the iso-butyl group would be -(CH2)C(CH3)2. So the CH2 attached to the benzene has a C(CH3)2 group.

Let me think about the NMR for iso-butyl.

The iso-butyl group:

The CH2 attached to the benzene (let's say position 4) would have two neighboring CH2 groups? Or perhaps the substituent is like -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but that's a pentyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group? Hmm, but the NMR has a triplet at 0.9, which is typical for a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain, so perhaps a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, but arranged in a way that the branching is at the second carbon (sec-butyl). So the structure would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that would be a four-carbon substituent. So, benzene with a COOH and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached.

Wait, but in that case, how would the NMR look?

The substituent's structure: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the CH2 attached to the benzene is next to a CH that has two CH2CH3 groups? No, that's not right. Let's think about the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)2. That's the iso-butyl group.

Wait, the iso-butyl group attached to the benzene would have a structure like this: benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2. So, the substituent is a CH2 connected to a C(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH2 (attached to the benzene) would be a triplet? Or perhaps a quartet? Hmm, but the NMR shows 1.7 ppm as a multiplet (2H), which could be the CH2 next to the branching point. Wait, in the iso-butyl group, the CH2 groups would be split into different multiplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I don't think that's the case. Let me think again about the NMR.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), that's a methyl group attached to a CH2. So the structure could be CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but wait, that would be a four-carbon substituent: CH2-CH(CH2CH3) would be four carbons in total. Wait, no, because the substituent is attached to the benzene via a CH2, then a CH, then a CH2CH3. So that would be a pentyl group, but maybe as a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group or something like that. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data:

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH group. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So, that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group (sec-butyl), which would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would be a four-carbon group: CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which is a four-carbon group, that is, a butyl group. But where's the branching?

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: That would have an ethyl group on the phenyl ring at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. But in the NMR, we don't see a propanoic acid's CH2 groups.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: That's cumene, but then where's the carbonyl in the IR?

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: That would have a benzoic acid and a sec-butyl substituent.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Again, this would be a substituted toluene, but no carbonyl group.

So, the IR shows a carbonyl, which is present in options A and C. So options B and D don't have a carbonyl, so they can be eliminated. So the correct answer is either A or C.

Now, in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzoic acid in the para position.

So, structure would be benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would make the substituent a four-carbon group? Let's think about the NMR of that.

The substituent would have:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

So, the CH2 attached to the benzene would have two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH group. The CH group would have one proton (if it's a CH(CH2CH3)), but wait, that's a CH2 group. Oh wait, no. If the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), then the CH2 next to benzene has two protons (which would be a triplet if next to a CH2), but wait, perhaps it's a quartet if next to a CH. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would be a four-carbon substituent. Let me draw it out:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the CH2 next to benzene is attached to a CH that has a CH2CH3 group.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH2 attached to the benzene: two protons, perhaps as a quartet (since adjacent to a CH group with one proton).

The CH group: one proton, which would be split into a triplet (if adjacent to two protons on CH2 and maybe another on the CH2CH3). So that's the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H).

The CH2CH3 group: the CH2 would be split into a triplet (since adjacent to the CH group), and the terminal CH3 would be a triplet as well. Wait, but in the NMR, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), so that fits.

The CH2 in the substituent adjacent to the benzene would be at around 1.7 ppm, perhaps as a quartet, integrating for 2H. That matches the 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H).

The CH(CH2CH3) would have its own set of protons. Wait, the CH group would have only one proton, so the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H).

So putting it all together, the substituent in option C would fit the NMR data.

Now, the reaction part: the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that this reaction is the hydrohalogenation of a carbonyl group. But wait, in the case of a carboxylic acid reacting with HX, maybe it's not a typical addition. Alternatively, I'm more familiar with the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that's for alpha-halo substitution in carboxylic acids. Wait, no, that's not it either.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroimination or maybe in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Wait, maybe if the starting material has a conjugated carbonyl and an alkene, but I don't see that in the structure.

Wait, no, the IR and NMR data don't indicate any alkenes. The IR doesn't have a strong double bond stretch around 1640 cm-1 (maybe the 1610 is C=C aromatic). So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a branched alkyl chain, but no alkene.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl like a carboxylic acid or ester. Oh wait, the peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, which for a carboxylic acid would be around 1700 cm-1. So that fits.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of an acid chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, I think that's the reagent used for the hydroxylation of carbonyl groups. Wait, no, maybe it's the formation of an imidazole intermediate. Alternatively, it's used in the Staudinger reaction, but that's for azides.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a ketone, but in this case, it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but I don't think HI and red phosphorus do that. Wait, maybe it's a halogenation reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen of the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and then attacked by HI. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has an alkene, and the reaction adds HI across the double bond. But earlier I thought there wasn't an alkene. Wait, the IR shows peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C bonds, not alkenes. So perhaps the compound doesn't have an alkene.

Wait, but maybe the substituent has a double bond. No, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another approach: the product options are all substituted benzoic acids or benzene derivatives. So after the reaction, what changes?

Looking at the options, the reaction likely converts the substituent into something else. So, perhaps the reaction is halogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think I've heard that red phosphorus can be used in the preparation of aryl halides through the Sandmeyer reaction, but that involves copper. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution if the substituent has a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the HI-induced cleavage of the carbonyl group. Wait, I remember that in the presence of HI, carboxylic acids can undergo various reactions. For example, esterification, but that requires an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid reacts with HI to form an acid chloride, but I don't think red phosphorus does that.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the addition of HI to a carbonyl group. But carboxylic acids are not typically reactive towards nucleophilic additions because they're strong acids and the carbonyl is resonance-stabilized.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a hydrogen on the benzene. Wait, but the substituents are already on the benzene. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is modified.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the dehydrohalogenation or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the benzylic position. For example, if the substituent is a branched alkyl group, HI could cause a cleavage. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzylic position, and HI could cause a substitution. Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the benzylic position is the CH2 attached to the benzene.

Wait, another angle: the reaction converts the substituent into a different group. For example, a sec-butyl group might be cleaved or modified when treated with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the sec-butyl group. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the Cleve reaction, which cleaves certain groups. Alternatively, maybe it's the Hofmann degradation, but that's for amines.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group, and the reaction is a substitution, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the synthesis of alkenes from alcohols, like in the oxymercuration process, but more accurately, I think they're used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes via the oxyphosphonium ion mechanism. But wait, the starting material doesn't have an alkene, so maybe I'm off track.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl halide. For example, if the substituent is a benzyl group, HI could protonate the oxygen, making it a better leaving group, leading to substitution. But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is not a benzyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring substitution, but the substituent is already on the ring.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible products.

Looking at the options, all the products are either substituted benzoic acids or substituted toluenes. None of them are alkenes or anything else. So the reaction must be modifying the substituent.

Wait, but the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. I think in some reactions, red phosphorus and HI can be used to replace the hydroxyl group in a carboxylic acid with a halogen. Wait, yes! I think when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI in presence of red phosphorus, the -OH is replaced by -I. So the reaction is:

RCOOH + HI (with red P) → RCOI + H2O.

So, the product would be an acyl iodide. But looking at the options, I don't see an acyl iodide. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but the starting material doesn't have a good leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the acid-catalyzed formation of an acylium ion, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about the reaction more carefully.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the preparation of aryl iodides from aryl halides, but that's more of a C-I bond formation. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting a hydroxyl group into an iodide.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it may form an acyl iodide. But the options don't have an acyl iodide. So perhaps the reaction is not that.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. But red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for reductions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by iodide.

Wait, if the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction replaces the -OH with -I, then the product would be benzoyl iodide. But the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes a reaction. For example, the sec-butyl group might be halogenated.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a branched alkyl chain. If the reaction is a substitution at the benzylic position, then the CH2 next to the benzene could be replaced by iodine. But I'm not sure how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is cleaved. For example, in the presence of HI, the sec-butyl group might undergo cleavage, leading to a shorter chain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the reaction part. Let me think about the options again. The initial structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's a sec-butyl group. So, the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI would depend on what the reaction does.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if the reaction doesn't change the substituent, maybe it's not the product. But that can't be right because the question says it reacts, so the product must be different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is removing the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, it could be eliminated. But without knowing the exact reaction mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring substitution. For example, substituting a hydrogen on the benzene ring with iodine. But the options don't seem to show that.

Wait, another approach: the IR and NMR data indicate that the starting material is a 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). So, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the -OH group is replaced with -I, forming 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But again, that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming an alkene. But the starting substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon. Wait, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the adjacent CH has a hydrogen. Maybe the reaction induces elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), elimination would form CH2=CH(CH2CH3), which is 1-pentene or something else. But I'm not sure how that would look on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, if the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), perhaps the reaction cleaves it into something else. For example, if the benzylic hydrogen is abstracted, and I don't know, maybe a carbocation forms, leading to rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the substituent is cleaved to form a shorter chain. For example, the CH2-CH(CH2CH3) could become CH2-I, but that would require substitution. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is not changed, and the reaction modifies the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride using red phosphorus and HI. But I think that reaction is more about forming an acyl chloride from an acid with a halide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should conclude that the starting material is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into something else.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. For example, replacing the hydroxyl group with iodine, but that would require the hydroxyl group to be on the ring, which it isn't in option C.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester instead of a carboxylic acid. Because the IR peak at 1720 could also be an ester. But the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more typical for a carboxylic acid. So, I think the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

So, going back, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be converting the -COOH into -COI, forming 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But since the options don't have that, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group. For example, HI adds to the carbonyl, but I don't think that would form an option given.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by iodide, but again, that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but adds HI somewhere else. But I don't see where.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the starting material. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the NMR data: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH2. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is a CH adjacent to a CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group.

Wait, the iso-butyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2. So, the substituent would be -CH2-C(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show the CH2 adjacent to the benzene as a quartet (split by the neighboring CH), the CH next to it (which is a C(CH3)2) wouldn't have any protons, so that's not matching the 2.9 ppm multiplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the substituent. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the methyl groups, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group, but that doesn't explain the 1.4 ppm doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group but in a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be a four-carbon substituent. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which is a butyl group with a branch.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene (position 4) would be a quartet (split by the adjacent CH), integrating for 2H. Maybe around 2.9 ppm? But wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would be a pentyl group with a branch.

I'm getting stuck trying to match the NMR to the substituent. Maybe I should move forward with the reaction.

Assuming the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, but I'm not sure what the product would be. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution at the benzylic position, replacing the CH2 with iodine.

Wait, if the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), the benzylic position is the CH2 group adjacent to the benzene. So, if that CH2 is replaced by iodine, the product would be benzene with COOH and -I at the para positions. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is cleaved into two -CH2-I groups, but I don't think that's possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the substituent, forming a double bond. Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). If the CH2 and CH are adjacent, elimination could form a double bond between them, leading to a vinyl group. But that would change the substituent into a -CH=CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a butenyl group. Then, the product would have a double bond, but the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is dehydrohalogenated, but without a halide, I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't modify the substituent but adds something else. But I don't see how.

Wait, maybe the reaction converts the carboxylic acid into a benzene ring with a methyl group and a substituent. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an acylium ion, which I don't think is formed here.

Wait, I'm really not sure about the reaction part. Maybe the correct answer is option C, but the reaction doesn't change anything, which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the reaction converts the substituent into something else.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the reaction could be converting the benzoic acid into a methyl group, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation. If the substituent is a bulky group like a sec-butyl, decarboxylation could occur under certain conditions, but I'm not sure what the product would be.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride, but the options don't show that.

I think I'm stuck on the reaction part, but maybe I should proceed with the initial identification of the starting material as option C and assume that the reaction doesn't change it, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH group is replaced by -I, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid iodide. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a benzene ring with a methyl group. But that doesn't fit the options.

Hmm. I think I've spent a lot of time on this, but I'm not entirely confident. Based on the IR and NMR data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would likely replace the -OH with -I, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the starting material.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methoxy group, but that doesn't fit the reaction conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. If the carboxylic acid is activated, perhaps HI can substitute the -OH with -I. But again, that's not in the options.

Given that I'm stuck, I think the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But the reaction part must result in one of the given options. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the formation of an acid iodide, which would then undergo some reaction, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the substituent's hydrogen with iodine, making it a bromide or iodide, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the starting material is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent but perhaps converts the acid into an acid chloride or iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a halogenation of the substituent's benzylic position. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the CH2 group attached to the benzene gets replaced by iodine. So the substituent becomes -I attached to the benzene, making the product 4-iodophenyl benzoic acid. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is cleaved, and the product becomes a shorter chain. For example, the substituent being a sec-butyl group could cleave to form a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is converted into a propyl group. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on the spectral data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI replaces the -OH with -I, making 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but does something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group and an iodide. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a benzene ring with a methyl group and an iodide substituent, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have a propanoic acid group and an ethyl substituent on the benzene. But the NMR data doesn't show a propanoic acid's CH2 groups, which would be around 2.4 ppm as a triplet. So I think option A is unlikely.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would have a sec-butyl and a methyl group on the benzene ring, but no carbonyl group, so it can't be the product since the starting material has a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into a benzene ring with a methyl group. But how? Maybe a decarboxylation reaction, but I'm not sure under what conditions that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced with a methyl group. That would form toluene derivatives, but without knowing the exact mechanism, I can't say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's not relevant here.

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not entirely confident about the reaction part.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a strong carbonyl C=O stretch), and peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data provides further evidence for a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a branched alkyl substituent.

### Analysis of the NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: This is consistent with the broad singlet of a carboxylic acid O-H proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: These are characteristic of a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two sets of protons split into doublets.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely a CH group adjacent to a branch in the substituent.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH₂.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain.

From this, the compound is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C), with a para-substituted benzene ring, a carboxylic acid group, and a sec-butyl substituent.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in reactions involving carboxylic acids, often leading to the formation of acyl halides (e.g., acid chlorides or acid iodides). In this case, the reaction likely replaces the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid with iodine (-I), forming **4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide**. However, none of the given options correspond to this product. 

Given the provided options, the most plausible conclusion is that the reaction does not alter the substituent but instead modifies the carboxylic acid group. Since the options do not include a product involving iodination or acyl iodide formation, the reaction may not significantly change the structure of the compound. Thus, the starting material remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectral data and the reaction conditions, the compound is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, and the reaction does not produce a product listed in the options. Therefore, the most consistent answer is:

**Answer: C**
