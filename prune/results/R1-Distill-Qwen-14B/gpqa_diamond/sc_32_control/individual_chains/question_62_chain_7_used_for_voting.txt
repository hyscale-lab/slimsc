Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The name suggests it has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO). Additionally, there's a substituent on the cyclohexane: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the same carbon as the formyl group.

Wait, so the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is attached to both a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that carbon is probably the one that was a methyl group in ethynylcyclohexane, but with modifications.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached.

Now, the goal is to convert this into the target molecule. Let's think about the transformations needed.

The target has a formyl group and an alcohol group attached to the same carbon. So, perhaps we need to introduce these groups through some reactions.

Let me think about the possible reactions. Ethynylcyclohexane could undergo hydroboration, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe some kind of oxidation or addition.

Wait, the starting material has a triple bond. Triple bonds can undergo hydrogenation, hydration, or other addition reactions. Let me think about possible steps.

Looking at the options, the reagents provided involve things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, O3, etc. These might be involved in deprotonation, alkylation, hydrogenation, oxidation, ozonolysis, etc.

So, let's think about what each reagent does.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: That's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. So maybe forming a new bond. Then H2/Pd would hydrogenate something. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then H2SO4 and HgSO4 in water—could that be oxidizing conditions?

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: Again, deprotonation and alkylation, but with ethyl chloride. Then Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and might induce elimination or alkylation. Ozone followed by work-up with NH4OH—that's ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: Same as A. Then H2/Pd with CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Then O3 with (CH3)2S as a work-up (which is a reductive work-up, so maybe breaking double bonds without forming ozonides). Then Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol: Deprotonation and then maybe alkylation with methanol? Then Li in liquid NH3, which could be for elimination or alkylation. Then O3 with (CH3)2S, same as C. Then NH4OH.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target structure again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane—so it's cyclohexane with a triple bond attached. Let's say the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

I need to get to a molecule where the same carbon that was CH2- is now attached to both a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think about that. Triple bonds can be oxidized to ketones under certain conditions. For example, using strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

But wait, the target has a formyl group (CHO) and an alcohol (OH). So maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, and then another substitution occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, and then functional groups are added.

Wait, let's outline the steps needed. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane:

1. Introduce a functional group that can later be oxidized to a formyl group. Or maybe oxidize the triple bond.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. If we add a hydroxyl group to the triple bond, perhaps via hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4, that would form a ketone. Wait, when an alkyne is treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4, it typically hydrates to a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane would turn into cyclohexanone with a CH2OH group? Or wait, no—wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH. Hydration would add an OH group to the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes a double bond with an OH and H on each side.

Wait, no. Hydration of a triple bond with HgSO4 and H2SO4 typically gives a ketone. For example, R-C≡CH + HgSO4/H2SO4 → R-C(OH)2-CH3? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the hydration of an alkyne can be done in two ways: acid-catalyzed hydration gives a ketone, and base-catalyzed gives an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. So, if you have an alkyne, say propyne (CH3-C≡CH), hydration would give acetone (CH3-C(O)-CH3). But in our case, the alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane, so it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hydration would give cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure after hydration would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)-CH3? Because the triple bond C≡CH becomes CH(OH)CH3 after hydration. No, wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So the triple bond is between carbons 2 and 3: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hydration would add an -OH and -H across the triple bond, so it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)-CH3. So that would be a ketone, right? Wait, no—it becomes a ketone if the OH is in the middle. So, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)-CH3, which is a secondary alcohol, but wait, that can't be right because the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH, so the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH. When you add H and OH across, you get CH2-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone (since the OH is on a carbon attached to two other carbons). Wait, no. The triple bond is CH2-CH2-C≡CH? No, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is between the CH2 and the CH. So, during hydration, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two OH groups? Or wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the triple bond becomes a carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait. No, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH, so when you hydrate it, you get CH2-C(OH)CH3, which would be a ketone. So that would give cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)CH3? Wait, that's cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (CO) and a CH3 attached. So that's cyclohexane-CH2-CO-CH3, which is cyclohexylacetone? Hmm, but the target molecule isn't a ketone; it's an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, and then some kind of oxidation or addition happens.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, and then functional groups are added. So, hydrogenation of the triple bond would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. So, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically gives a single bond, so after hydrogenation, ethynylcyclohexane would become CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane, but that's not correct. Wait, more accurately, hydrogenation of a triple bond (C≡C) to a single bond (C-C) would require adding two hydrogen atoms to each carbon in the triple bond. So, the triple bond CH2-C≡CH would become CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent: CH2-C≡CH. So, when you hydrogenate it with H2 and a catalyst (like Pd), the triple bond would become a single bond, so the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, wait. The triple bond is between two carbons: CH2-C≡C-H. So, hydrogenation would add H's to each carbon in the triple bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2 groups? No, wait, hydrogenation of the triple bond would result in CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, no—if you hydrogenate a triple bond all the way to single, you get a single bond with two Hs added. So, ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH) becomes CH2-CH2-CH3 after hydrogenation. Wait, but that would be a single bond between the two carbons. So, the substituent becomes a CH2-CH2-CH3 group. But that substituent is a straight chain, but I'm not sure if that helps in making the target molecule.

Wait, but the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) and an alcohol group (OH) on the same carbon. So, perhaps that carbon needs to have two new functional groups added.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a bromide or some leaving group, then undergoes substitution.

Wait, looking at the reagents again. The options involve NaNH2, which is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps in the first step, a deprotonation followed by alkylation occurs.

For example, NaNH2 is used to deprotonate a compound, then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would provide a methyl group. That would be an alkylation via a strong base, perhaps forming a new bond.

So, let's say the ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2, which deprotonates the alkyne (since alkynes are acidic, pKa around 25). Then methyl chloride would methylate the deprotonated site. Wait, but where? If the alkyne's terminal is deprotonated, and then methyl chloride (a methylating agent) is added, that would add a methyl group to the sp-hybridized carbon. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH) treated with NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal CH, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- , which then reacts with CH3Cl to form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, that would make the triple bond into a single bond with two CH3 groups? No, wait, no—that would be a substitution. So, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no, because CH3Cl would donate a methyl group, so the triple bond would have a methyl added to the sp carbon. So, after alkylation, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that's a longer chain. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, and after deprotonation and alkylation, a new substituent is added. Maybe the NaNH2 and methyl chloride add a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone. Wait, earlier I thought about hydration. So, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted to a ketone.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) and an alcohol (OH) on the same carbon. That suggests that perhaps there was a geminal diol (two OH groups on the same carbon), which was oxidized to a carbonyl group. But wait, geminal diols are typically unstable and would tautomerize or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is converted into a ketone, and then the ketone is transformed into an aldehyde and an alcohol.

Wait, let's think about steps:

1. Maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone.

2. Then, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, but that wouldn't give an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group (like a ketone), then that ketone is reduced in a specific way to get an aldehyde and an alcohol.

Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a carbonyl group, then through some kind of addition, another group is added.

Wait, let me think about the target structure again. The substituent on the cyclohexane is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, that's a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane ring, which itself is attached to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, that substituent is a CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon. So, the main carbon is attached to:

- The cyclohexane ring,

- A formyl group (CHO),

- A CH2 group which is attached to OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, maybe the starting material's triple bond needs to be modified to form that structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then some kind of substitution or addition occurs.

Another approach: the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking that down, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the cyclohexane has a formyl group. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, so the main carbon (the one with the formyl group) is attached to a CH2 group that has both an OH and a cyclohexyl substituent.

So, perhaps the main carbon underwent some kind of alkylation to add the CH2 group, which then had an OH added.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard or organometallic reagent is added to form the substituted alcohol.

Wait, but the options don't show Grignard reagents. Let me look at the options again.

Option C's steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd with CaCO3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option A:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: probably deprotonate and methylate, adding a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate something. Maybe hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2: strong base, perhaps elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: hydration or oxidation?

Wait, but the target doesn't have any triple bonds, so step 2 would hydrogenate the triple bond.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-CH2-CH2 attached to cyclohexane? No, perhaps it becomes a di-substituted alkane. Wait, no—ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hydrogenation would turn the triple bond into a single bond, so it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single substituent, not helpful for forming a formyl and alcohol group.

Alternatively, after step 1 and 2, maybe the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option step by step.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: deprotonation and alkylation. Maybe this adds a methyl group to the alkyne.

So, ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH) reacts with NaNH2 to deprotonate the triple bond, giving CH2-C≡C^-. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate, giving CH2-C≡C-CH3.

So after step 1, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd with CaCO3: hydrogenation of the triple bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So, the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, but that's just a longer chain.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S: ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but if the molecule has a double bond, it would break. But after step 2, all triple bonds are gone (they've been hydrogenated to single bonds). So unless step 2 leaves a double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. Wait, unless step 2 is a partial hydrogenation.

Wait, no. If step 2 is H2 and Pd, it would fully hydrogenate any triple bonds to single bonds. So, after step 2, the triple bond is gone. So ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't have anything to act on.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps step 2 is not about hydrogenating the triple bond but something else. Or maybe the triple bond is first converted into a double bond, then hydrogenated.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a double bond, and then hydrogenated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are adding a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer, and then hydrogenating to a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another angle.

The target molecule has a formyl group. How is a formyl group typically introduced? One way is oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. Another way is via a Grignard reaction with a formyl chloride, but that's not in the options.

Hmm, looking at the reagents, some options involve O3 and then work-up. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond in the molecule, ozonolysis would break it and form carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps in the reaction sequence, after some steps, a double bond is created which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form the formyl group.

So, let's imagine that.

Suppose ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a di-substituted alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target has only one formyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a di-substituted alkene, and then ozonolysis would break it into a single carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is to add a substituent to the alkyne, then hydrogenate to form a double bond, then ozonolyse to form the aldehyde.

Let me think through this.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane:

1. React with NaNH2 and methyl chloride: deprotonate the alkyne, then methylate to form a substituted alkyne. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, but H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate all the way to single bonds. Unless it's a Lindlar catalyst, which hydrogenates triple bonds to cis double bonds. But the options don't mention Lindlar catalyst, just H2 and Pd. So, the triple bond would become a single bond. So after step 2, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, this doesn't form a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Perhaps the initial step adds a methyl group, making the alkyne longer, and then another step creates a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is a deprotonation and alkylation, leading to a longer chain, and then dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But that would require some kind of elimination.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D has step 2 as Li in liq NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

So, considering option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: deprotonate the alkyne's terminal H, then alkylate with methanol? Wait, but methanol is a poor methylating agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: adds a methyl group to the alkyne. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd with CaCO3: hydrogenate the triple bond. So, becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a longer chain, but I don't see how that helps in forming the target.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S: but without a double bond, nothing happens. So this doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: deprotonate and alkylation with ethyl chloride. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in liq NH3: strong base, perhaps for elimination. If the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, treating with Li/NH3 might deprotonate and eliminate, but where?

Wait, if we have CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, perhaps elimination would form a triple bond again, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in liquid NH3 is for something else, like an alkylation. Or maybe it's used to form a Grignard-like reagent.

3. O3 followed by NH4OH: ozonolysis. So if there's a double bond, it would cleave into carbonyl groups.

But after step 2, if a double bond was formed via elimination, then step 3 would cleave it.

Hmm, perhaps that's a way to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolysis breaks it into two formyl groups.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane would become a diene upon hydrogenation? No, hydrogenation would add H's across triple bonds to make single bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Breaking it down, it's cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which is a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl.

So, perhaps the starting material's triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, and then another substitution occurs.

Wait, here's a possible pathway:

1. Convert the triple bond into a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexanone with a substituent.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, the triple bond would become a ketone. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)CH3.

But the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde (CHO), not a ketone (CO).

So, perhaps the ketone is then reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is first reduced to a secondary alcohol, and then some kind of elimination occurs to form an aldehyde.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about each option.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: deprotonate the triple bond, then alkylate with methanol. So, methanol would provide a methyl group? Or perhaps the NaNH2 deprotonates, and methanol acts as an electrophile. Wait, but methanol is not a good methylating agent. Maybe it's a protection step, but I'm not sure.

2. Li in liq NH3: a strong base, perhaps for elimination or alkylation.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S: ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: work-up, maybe for cleaving ozonides.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group.

2. Use Li/NH3 for elimination to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis of the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up with NH4OH (maybe to prevent overoxidation or something).

But I'm still not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond, then ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how? Let me think:

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. O3: no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm, not helpful.

Option B:

Steps 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So, alkyne becomes longer.

Step 2: Li/NH3. Maybe elimination to form a double bond.

So, the structure becomes a diene, perhaps?

Step 3: O3 cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH work-up.

Hmm. If the double bond is internal, ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyl groups. But in this case, the target has only one formyl group, so maybe the other part is a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps after adding a substituent, the molecule has a double bond that, when ozonolyzed, forms a formyl group on one end and a cyclohexyl carbonyl on the other.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct pathway is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne via deprotonation and alkylation (step 1 in options A, B, C, D).

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis double bond using a catalyst like Lindlar's, but the options don't have that. So, maybe another way.

Wait, if step 2 is H2 with Pd, it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, which doesn't help form a double bond. So perhaps step 2 is a different kind of hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents involve adding a hydroxyl group, then forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination reactions, such as the formation of a carbonyl group via the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's used for epoxidation, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for saponification or elimination.

Wait, let's think about the target structure again. It has a formyl group and an alcohol group on the same carbon. That suggests that perhaps that carbon was previously a geminal diol, which was then oxidized to a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, another possibility: the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group (using a strong oxidizing agent), making a ketone. Then, some kind of substitution or addition occurs to add a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group to the same carbon.

But the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which after oxidation would give a ketone attached to the cyclohexane. Then, perhaps a Grignard reaction adds a cyclohexyl group and an -OH group. But the options don't include Grignard reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, then something else happens.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone (using HgSO4 and H2SO4). Then, the ketone is treated with a nucleophile, like a cyclohexyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is transformed into an enol, which then undergoes some kind of reaction to form the alcohol and aldehyde.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option's sequence.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: deprotonate the alkyne, then perhaps methylate with methanol. But methanol is a poor methylating agent; maybe it's adding a hydroxymethyl group? Not sure.

2. Li in liquid NH3: a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Suppose the structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OH? Because if step 1 adds a hydroxymethyl group, but I'm not certain.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis. If there's a double bond, it would cleave into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: maybe aqueous work-up.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

Option C:

After step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3: hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S: but no double bonds, so nothing happens.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2: strong base, maybe elimination, but I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. To form an aldehyde, perhaps the starting material's triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, and then oxidized to an aldehyde. But wait, oxidation of a secondary alcohol doesn't give an aldehyde; it would give a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl (a ketone), then that ketone is transformed into a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone again. Hmm, that doesn't help.

Another possibility: the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group, then the carbonyl is subjected to some alkylation to add a substituent, which is then hydrolyzed to an alcohol.

Wait, let's think about each step again.

Target structure: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent.

The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl.

How can we get that group onto the main chain?

Perhaps via a Grignard reaction or some kind of substitution.

But the options don't have Grignard reagents. So maybe the substituent is added through a different method.

Wait, another thought: after adding a methyl group (step 1), hydrogenate the triple bond to form a secondary alcohol (step 2), then oxidize that to a ketone (step 3), then somehow convert that into a formyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group (a ketone), then somehow that ketone is split into an aldehyde and an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps ozonolysis of a double bond would form two carbonyl groups. So if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two parts.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

After step 1: adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Step 2: hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then, step 3 is ozonolysis—no double bond, so nothing happens.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the NaNH2 and methyl chloride step is a deprotonation followed by alkylation to add a methyl group, then hydrogenation to add more H's, then ozonolysis to break a double bond, forming the aldehyde.

Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't of the triple bond but of some other part. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a cis double bond, then hydrogenated, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the sequence that ends with the formyl group and the hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

Let me think about the target again. The formyl is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups. So, perhaps a geminal diol is formed, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But how to form a geminal diol from the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then hydroboration occurs to add two OH groups on the same carbon.

Wait, but the options don't include hydroboration reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into an alkene, then subjected to ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, here's a possible sequence:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis: but without a double bond, nothing.

Hmm, not helpful.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the steps that would introduce the formyl group and the hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagent sequence involves:

a) Adding a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation.

b) Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond.

c) Ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

d) Work-up.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to visualize the product of each option.

Option C:

After step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → no double bond, so no reaction.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination, but without a good leaving group, not much happens.

So, the product doesn't match the target.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the alkyne becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3? But I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

So, structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-OCH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls. So, OCH3 group would form a carbonyl, and the other part would form another carbonyl.

But the target has a formyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Option B:

Step 1: Ethyl group added to the alkyne, making it longer.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → elimination to form a double bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleaves into two carbonyls.

But the target has only one formyl group, so this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form a formyl group and another carbonyl.

But I don't see the options that match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond (but how? Since H2/Pd usually fully hydrogenates).

Wait, unless the hydrogenation is partial, like using a different catalyst. But the options don't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard-like addition of a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group occurs, but I don't see that in the reagents.

Hmm.

Maybe the correct option is C.

Wait, in option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → add methyl group to alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

Step 3: Ozone with (CH3)2S → perhaps if there's a double bond formed in another way.

Wait, but after step 2, the triple bond is gone. So unless another double bond is formed, step 3 won't do anything.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a trans double bond, then hydrogenated. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the target's formyl group comes from ozonolysis of a triple bond. No, ozonolysis is for double bonds.

Wait, perhaps after adding a methyl group, the molecule undergoes dehydrogenation to form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

But I don't see that in the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

After step 1, the alkyne becomes a gem-dimethyl group or something.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about which option ends with the correct groups.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, perhaps in the reaction steps, a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group are added to the same carbon.

Looking at the reagents, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis of a double bond (but where would the double bond come from?)

Wait, I'm going in circles.

Alternative approach: the correct option is C.

In option C, the steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → add methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single.

3. Ozone and (CH3)2S → nothing, but wait, maybe the hydrogenation actually forms a double bond? No, H2 and Pd usually fully hydrogenate.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the hydrogenation. Maybe the hydrogenation is not of the triple bond but of something else. Or perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond in an earlier step.

Wait, perhaps the first step converts the alkyne into an enol ether or something, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis double bond using a different catalyst, but the options don't specify.

3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up forms the aldehyde and the alcohol.

But without seeing the exact steps, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, after step 3 in option C, O3 with (CH3)2S: perhaps the molecule has a double bond formed in step 2. But step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the formyl and hydroxyl. So, perhaps that group comes from a cyclohexyl Grignard reagent, but since the options don't include that, maybe it's added via another method.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the NaNH2 and methyl chloride step adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Then, hydrogenation adds H's, and then ozonolysis breaks the molecule into two parts, one of which is the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding a methyl group, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis breaks it into carbonyl groups.

But without the double bond, ozonolysis doesn't work.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the option that uses O3 and forms a carbonyl group, which would be the formyl group in the target.

Looking at the options, option C and D use O3.

Option C steps:

After step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S.

If the molecule has a double bond, this would cleave it.

So, perhaps in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond.

Wait, but how? Because H2 and Pd normally hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, unless the catalyst is Lindlar's, which would hydrogenate triple bonds to cis double bonds. But the options don't specify that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, because after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, making a longer chain, and then step 3 doesn't do anything. But that doesn't form the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target again.

The target is cyclohexane with a substituent: CHO and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol and aldehyde on the same carbon. So, maybe the starting material's triple bond is transformed into a carbonyl group, then the adjacent carbon is functionalized with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then a cyclohexyl group is added via alkylation, and then the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Because in option C, after adding a methyl group and hydrogenating, the molecule has a longer chain, which upon ozonolysis would form the aldehyde.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, after thinking through all this, I think the correct sequence is option C. Let me see.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl group to alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. O3 → no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Another thought: maybe the triple bond is first converted into a double bond via some reaction, then hydrogenated, then ozonolysis is performed on a new double bond.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. Ozonolysis typically forms carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the correct option uses ozonolysis to form the formyl group.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D involve ozonolysis.

Option D's steps: after O3, work-up with NH4OH. Perhaps that forms the aldehyde.

Wait, here's a possible sequence for option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: deprotonate the alkyne, then alkylate with methanol. So, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/NH3: strong base, perhaps eliminate to form a double bond. So, the structure becomes CH2-C=CH-OCH3.

3. O3: cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would split into two parts: one part with OCH3 and the other part with the aldehyde.

4. NH4OH: work-up, maybe hydrolysis of the OCH3 group to OH.

So, perhaps after these steps, the product would have an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe option D is the correct one.

In that case, the sequence would be:

1. Deprotonate and add a hydroxymethyl group.

2. Eliminate to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form the hydroxyl group.

Thus, the target would be formed.

So, I think the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a longer alkyl chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or dehydrogenation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration or oxidation conditions.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the formyl group and hydroxyl group are introduced on the same carbon. The steps do not align well with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination to form a double bond.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up for ozonolysis products.

While ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl group and formyl group are introduced on the same carbon. Additionally, the ethyl group added in step 1 does not directly contribute to the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd, CaCO₃**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a longer alkyl chain.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or dehydrogenation.

This sequence is problematic because ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2. The steps do not align with the formation of the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a hydroxymethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination to form a double bond.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up for ozonolysis products.

This sequence aligns well with the target structure. After step 1, the alkyne is functionalized with a hydroxymethyl group. Step 2 forms a double bond, which is cleaved by ozonolysis in step 3 to introduce a formyl group. The work-up in step 4 likely hydrolyzes intermediates to form the hydroxyl group. This sequence explains how the formyl and hydroxyl groups are introduced on the same carbon.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the most plausible sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule. The steps involve functionalizing the alkyne, forming a double bond, cleaving it with ozonolysis, and final work-up to introduce the required functional groups.

**Answer: D**
