Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are different power laws.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star, right? So the formula I know is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, so d = 1/plx. Oh wait, right, because parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, so 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars (N) relates to parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. Let me think about that substitution.

So if I substitute plx with 1/d, then 1/plx^5 becomes 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 equals d^5. So N ∝ d^5. 

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So does that mean we're looking for the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance r with thickness dr? Or maybe it's a cumulative number up to a certain distance?

Wait, the problem says 'per unit range of distance, r.' So perhaps it's the differential number of stars with respect to distance. So maybe N dr ∝ d^5 dr? Or wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So as parallax increases, the number of stars increases because 1/plx^5 would be higher when plx is lower. But wait, no: 1/plx^5, if plx is small (because the star is far away), then 1/plx^5 is a large number. But wait, that can't be right because when a star is farther away, it's dimmer and harder to see, so maybe there are fewer stars observed. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number density. Like, the number of stars per unit volume or something.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars as a function of parallax is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And since plx is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d), substituting gives N ∝ (d)^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. But wait, that can't make sense because as you go further away, you should see fewer stars, right? Because stars get fainter, or perhaps because the volume increases, but the number density might not increase that much.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about this again. The number of stars as a function of parallax is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with d^5. But wait, that would mean that as you look further away, you see exponentially more stars, which seems counterintuitive because at larger distances, individual stars would be harder to see. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering how the number of stars in a given volume changes with distance. So if we're considering a volume of space, the number of stars in that volume might depend on the distance.

Wait, but the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number of stars in a region (per unit area on the sky) at a certain parallax is proportional to 1/plx^5. So for a given area and a certain range of parallax, the number is 1/plx^5.

Wait, but parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so when you're looking at a certain distance, you have a certain plx. So the number of stars would go up as distance increases because 1/plx^5 increases as d^5. Wait, but that contradicts intuition because when you go further away, each star appears dimmer, so you can't see as many. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit of distance. So, for a given distance, how many stars are there per unit volume? Or maybe it's the number in a shell between r and r+dr.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is given by N ∝ d^5. But the number of stars per unit distance would then be N per dr, which would be proportional to d^5. But wait, if you have a shell at radius r with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is approximately 4π r² dr. But how does the number of stars in that shell depend on r?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The problem says that N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Since plx = 1/d, then plx = d^{-1}. So substituting, 1/(plx)^5 = (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But how does N change with distance? The problem is asking about the dependence on distance. So at a distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So if you increase the distance, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of d. But that seems odd because when you look further away, you can't see as many stars because they are fainter. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem refers to the number of stars per unit volume, or per unit area. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance is given by N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since each star's brightness (apparent magnitude) depends on their distance, but the number observed also depends on the volume, which increases with distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a function of distance. Let's think in terms of flux. The number of stars you can detect might depend on their luminosity and distance. But the problem seems to be giving a direct relation between N and plx as 1/plx^5.

So, N(r) = k * (1/(plx)^5) = k * (d^5), since plx = 1/d.

So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So perhaps we're looking for dN/dr, the change in number of stars per unit distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5 d^4. So the number of stars increases with d^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is r^5, option C is r^4. So if dN/dr ∝ d^4, then the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not getting this wrong. The problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N = C / (plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N = C * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So for a small change in distance dr, the change in N is dN = 5 C d^4 dr. So dN/dr = 5 C d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r) increases as r^4.

So the answer would be C, which is ~ r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the differential but the total number up to a certain distance. If so, then integrating N from 0 to R would give something else. But the question says "per unit range of distance, r", which suggests it's the differential.

So putting it all together, the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4, so the answer is option C.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5 \). Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This implies we need to consider the differential change in the number of stars with respect to distance, \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), taking the derivative gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
