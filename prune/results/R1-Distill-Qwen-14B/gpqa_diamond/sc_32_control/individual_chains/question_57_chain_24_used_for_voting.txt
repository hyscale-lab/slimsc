Okay, so I have this problem about the scattering amplitude in electron-nucleus collisions. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude is related to the optical theorem or something like that. Wait, the question specifically asks about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the imaginary part is connected to the total cross-section, I think.

The given phase shifts are delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, delta_3, and delta_4. The rest are zero, so we can ignore them. So we have phase shifts up to l=4. Wait, no, l is the angular momentum quantum number. So delta_0 corresponds to l=0, delta_1 to l=1, and so on.

I recall the formula for the scattering amplitude f(theta, phi). For elastic scattering, it's given by something like:

f(theta, phi) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) * (delta_l) * P_l(cosθ) ) ] * e^{i phi} ?

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) e^{i φ}

Wait, no, I think that's the expression. But the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ would be 0 degrees, because the beam is along the initial direction.

Wait, when the scattering is along the beam direction, θ is 0 degrees, right? So cosθ would be 1. The incident beam direction is the same as the initial direction. So, the point is that for θ=0, the spherical harmonics or the associated Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are evaluated.

But wait, the associated Legendre polynomials P_l^m(x). For m=0, since the phase shifts are summed over m=0 I think. So for each l, P_l(cosθ) evaluated at θ=0 is P_l(1). But P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1. So that's a key point.

So the amplitude simplifies when θ=0. Let me think. The amplitude f(0, phi) would then be:

f(0, phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l P_l(1) e^{i phi}

But since P_l(1) is 1, this becomes:

f(0, phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l e^{i phi}

Wait, but the exponential e^{i delta} can be written as cos delta + i sin delta. So e^{i delta} sin delta = [cos delta + i sin delta] * sin delta = sin delta (cos delta + i sin delta) = (sin delta cos delta) + i (sin^2 delta).

Wait, but the imaginary part of f would be the coefficient of the i term. So let's find the imaginary part of f(0, phi). Hmm, but phi is the azimuthal angle. Wait, but the problem says along the incident beam direction. Does that mean phi is fixed, or perhaps we're considering the average over phi?

Wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I think that in the case of elastic scattering, when considering the direction of the beam, the amplitude's dependence on phi might factor out. But perhaps the question is looking for the magnitude of the imaginary part, or maybe the average.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the imaginary part of the amplitude in that direction. Let's see, for f(0, phi), the imaginary part would be the sum over l of (2l+1) [e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l] times e^{i phi}.

Wait, but e^{i phi} is a phase factor. The imaginary part would then be the imaginary part of the sum multiplied by e^{i phi}. Let me think about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude of the imaginary part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the imaginary part of f averaged over all phi, or perhaps it's considering the imaginary part for any phi, but taking the direction along the beam.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The imaginary part of f is simply taking the imaginary component of the amplitude. So, f is a complex quantity, and the imaginary part is Im(f(0, phi)).

But wait, the scattering amplitude f has a dependence on both theta and phi, but perhaps the question is about the value when theta is 0 and phi is 0, or some specific phi? Or maybe it's considering the modulus, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is often related to the total cross-section. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section sigma_total is equal to (4π/k²) times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (theta=0). So sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

Wait, but the question is to find the imaginary part of f along the incident beam direction, which is theta=0. So perhaps the imaginary part Im(f(0)) is what we're looking for.

Wait, but the formula for f(0) would include contributions from all the phase shifts. Let me write it again.

f(θ=0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) [something]

Wait, perhaps I should recall the precise formula. The scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by:

f(theta, phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] P_l (cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, no, perhaps it's e^{i delta_l} (sin delta_l) P_l (cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think. The standard expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of the partial wave expansion is:

f(theta, phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{i delta_l} (sin delta_l) ] P_l (cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me look up the formula in my notes. Oh wait, I can't do that right now. Alternatively, I can think about the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, the general expression is:

f(theta,phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) (e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l) P_l (cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, no, perhaps the phase shift delta_l is real, so e^{i delta_l} = cos delta_l + i sin delta_l. So the term e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l would be (cos delta_l + i sin delta_l) * sin delta_l = cos delta_l sin delta_l + i sin^2 delta_l.

So the real part would be cos delta_l sin delta_l, and the imaginary part would be sin^2 delta_l.

Ah, so the imaginary part of f(theta, phi) would be:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ sin^2 delta_l ] P_l (cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, no, because f is a complex function. But in the case of theta=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

Im(f(0, phi)) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l e^{i phi}.

Wait, but e^{i phi} is a phase factor. For any given phi, the imaginary part would be:

sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l * e^{i phi} multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, but the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Does this mean theta=0, and phi=0? Or perhaps it's considering the magnitude of the imaginary part in that direction, regardless of phi? Or maybe the question is looking for the imaginary part averaged over phi.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the modulus of the imaginary part. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let's think again.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section sigma_total is (4π/k²) times the imaginary part of f evaluated at theta=0, phi=0. So sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

Wait, in the optical theorem, the expression is Im(f(0,0)) = (k/4π) sigma_total, or something like that. Oh, wait, the exact relation is:

sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0,0)).

So the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at theta=0 and phi=0 is Im(f(0,0)) = (k/(4π)) sigma_total.

But wait, we don't have sigma_total given here. So perhaps the question is directly asking for the imaginary part of f at theta=0, but perhaps it's taking the average over phi or something else.

Wait, but the given phase shifts are up to l=4. So the sum in the imaginary part is up to l=4. Let me write down the formula again. Since theta is 0, P_l(1)=1, so for each l, the term is (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) e^{i phi}, multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, but phi is the azimuthal angle. When you're considering the scattering amplitude in a particular direction, perhaps it's considering phi=0, or perhaps it's the modulus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the modulus of the imaginary part, which would be the square root of the sum of squares.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed step by step.

First, the problem gives the phase shifts up to l=4. So l can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Each term in the sum for the imaginary part Im(f) would be (2l+1) [ sin^2(delta_l) ] times e^{i phi}.

Wait, but e^{i phi} is a phase factor. So for a specific phi, say phi=0, the term would be (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

But the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is theta=0. So perhaps the problem is looking for the imaginary part of the amplitude evaluated at theta=0, regardless of phi. But I'm a bit confused because the imaginary part would depend on phi.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the average over all phi. Hmm, but the options are numbers without any units mentioned beyond the 'fm' units. Wait, the options are in fm, which is femtometers, and this is a length unit.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of inverse length, like inverse meters or inverse femtometers. So the options are actually in units of fm, which would be 1e-15 meters. Wait, no, because if f is in inverse femtometers, then 1/fm would be a huge number. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length. Because the cross-section is in barns, which are area (length squared), and the optical theorem relates the cross-section to the imaginary part of the amplitude.

Wait, the cross-section sigma has units of area (m^2). The optical theorem says sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0,0)).

k is in units of 1/length. So when you compute Im(f(0,0)), it's a term with units of area multiplied by k²/(4π). So:

Im(f(0,0)) = (k^2/(4π)) sigma_total.

Since sigma_total is area, and k is 1/length, then (k²) (sigma_total) has units (1/length^2) * (length^2) ) = dimensionless. So the right-hand side is (1/(4π)) * (something dimensionless). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on units. Let's proceed with the calculation.

Back to the problem. The phase shifts are delta_0=90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, delta_4=13 degrees. So in radians, we can compute sin(delta_l) and sin^2(delta_l).

Wait, but the formula for the imaginary part of f is:

Im(f(theta=0, phi)) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) e^{i phi}.

Wait, but since the question is about the imaginary part along the beam direction, perhaps it's considering the modulus, or perhaps it's taking phi=0. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the square of the imaginary part, or the sum of squares. I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the imaginary part at theta=0, regardless of phi.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of the amplitude is given by Im(f) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) P_l(1) e^{i phi} / k.

So, for theta=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) e^{i phi}.

But this is a complex expression. The problem is asking for the imaginary part, so perhaps the question is, in fact, asking for the imaginary part of f evaluated at theta=0, and for a specific phi. But without knowing phi, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the modulus, or perhaps the question is concerned with the magnitude of the imaginary part, regardless of phi.

Wait, but the options are real numbers, so perhaps the problem is asking for the modulus of the imaginary part, or perhaps the sum of the squares. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average over phi, which would involve integrating over phi and taking the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part as a function of phi and then find the maximum or the average. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things and just wants the sum of the contributions, treating each term as a complex number, and then taking the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the amplitude f(0, phi) and then take its imaginary part. But since the formula for f at theta=0 includes terms proportional to e^{i phi}, the imaginary part would be a function of phi. But the question is asking for the value along the beam direction, which is for any phi, but perhaps the question is referring to the maximum possible value.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem gives phase shifts for l=0 to 4. So l=0: delta_0=90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.

Wait, sin(90 degrees) is 1, so sin^2(90) =1.

For l=1: delta_1=67 degrees. So in radians, that's approximately 1.17 radians. sin(67 degrees) is about 0.92, so sin^2 is about 0.846.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Alternatively, perhaps I should use calculators for precise values.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) for each l, and then multiply by some factor involving k.

Wait, let's look at the formula again. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(theta, phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) P_l(cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, but when theta=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

f(0, phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) e^{i phi}.

Which can be written as:

f(0, phi) = (1/k) e^{i phi} sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l).

But e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l is [cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l)] * sin(delta_l) = sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l) + i sin^2(delta_l).

So the real part is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l), and the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

So the imaginary part of f(0, phi) is:

Im(f(0, phi)) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) e^{i phi}.

Wait, but this is a complex expression. The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the imaginary part, which would be a real number, right?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The amplitude f has a real and an imaginary part. So when I take the imaginary part of f, it's a real number, but in this case, because of the e^{i phi} term, the expression becomes:

Im(f) = (1/k) [ sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) ] multiplied by e^{i phi}.

Wait, but that can't be right because e^{i phi} is a complex exponential.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me go back.

The term e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) is equal to sin(delta_l) e^{i delta_l}.

Wait, but e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) = sin(delta_l) (cos delta_l + i sin delta_l) ) = sin delta_l cos delta_l + i sin^2 delta_l.

So when I sum over all l, each term is (2l+1) [ sin delta_l cos delta_l + i sin^2 delta_l ].

So f(0, phi) is (1/k) e^{i phi} sum_{l} (2l+1) [ sin delta_l cos delta_l + i sin^2 delta_l ].

So f(0, phi) = (1/k) e^{i phi} [ sum (2l+1) sin delta_l cos delta_l + i sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l ].

So this can be written as:

f(0, phi) = (1/k) e^{i phi} [ A + i B ],

where A = sum (2l+1) sin delta_l cos delta_l,

and B = sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

So the imaginary part of f(0, phi) is Im(f) = (1/k) e^{i phi} (i B ) ?

Wait, wait no. Because (A + i B) multiplied by e^{i phi} is (A + i B)(cos phi + i sin phi) = A cos phi - B sin phi + i (A sin phi + B cos phi).

So the imaginary part is A sin phi + B cos phi.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction. So when the direction is along the beam, phi is zero? Or perhaps it's the forward direction, which is phi=0.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the imaginary part of the amplitude, regardless of phi. Or perhaps the maximum possible value.

Wait, but the given options are numbers without any phi dependence, so perhaps the problem is asking for the modulus of the imaginary part, or perhaps the average over phi.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude evaluated at theta=0 and phi=0, which is Im(f(0, 0)).

Wait, in that case, phi=0, so e^{i phi} =1. Then f(0,0) = (1/k) [A + i B ]

So Im(f(0,0)) = B/k.

So the problem reduces to computing B = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) and then dividing by k.

But wait, what is k? The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE}/ħ), but perhaps in this problem, the electrons are 50 MeV. Wait, the energy is given as 50 MeV, so I need to compute k.

Wait, let's compute k. The electrons have energy E = 50 MeV. Wait, but electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy is E = 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e, so we can approximate it as a relativistic particle.

The relativistic relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So p = E c / c = E / (c^2) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1.

Wait, in natural units, E (in MeV) is equal to m c² when the particle is at rest. For a moving particle, E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4.

But perhaps we can use the non-relativistic approximation since E is 50 MeV and m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so E ≈ 97.8 m_e c². So it's relativistic, but perhaps the non-relativistic approximation won't hold. Hmm.

Wait, but for high energies, the momentum p is approximately E/c. Since E ≫ m c², p ≈ E/(c^2) * c = E/(c).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of E.

The wave number k is given by k = p / ħ.

So first, compute p in units of MeV/c.

E = 50 MeV.

Using E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2,

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈ 50 MeV.

So p c ≈ 50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV) / c.

Now, ħ c is a known constant. In natural units, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

Thus, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / ħ c ) ) → Hmm, perhaps I should write it as:

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c * (MeV/(fm)) )^{-1} )

Wait, perhaps a better approach: to compute p in units where ħ c is known.

p c = 50 MeV (from E ≈ pc for high energy).

So p = (50 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) ) * (c / 1) ) → ?

Wait, perhaps I can express k in terms of 1/fm.

Because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

So, p = (50 MeV) / c.

But p = (50 MeV) / (c * 1) → Hmm, perhaps I should compute p in units of MeV/(fm) because ħ c is in MeV fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute p in units of MeV / (fm) × c, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in units of 1/fm.

We have:

k = p / ħ.

p = (50 MeV) / c.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = (50 MeV) / c → p = (50 / 197.33) (MeV c / MeV c) ) × (ħ c) ) → Hmm, perhaps it's better to write:

p c = 50 MeV → p = 50 MeV / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c ) / ħ.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

Wait, so substituting back,

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ) ) ) = 50 / 197.33 [ MeV/c ] * [ c/(MeV fm) ) ] = 50/(197.33) * 1/fm.

So k = (50 / 197.33) 1/fm ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Now, compute B = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

Each delta_l is given in degrees, so I'll convert them to radians.

Compute sin^2 for each:

l=0: delta_0=90 degrees → sin(90)=1 → sin²=1.

l=1: 67 degrees → sin(67) ≈ 0.9205 → sin²≈0.8473.

l=2: 55 degrees → sin(55) ≈ 0.8192 → sin²≈0.6710.

l=3: 30 degrees → sin(30)=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

l=4: 13 degrees → sin(13) ≈ 0.22495 → sin²≈0.0506.

Now, compute (2l+1) * sin² for each l:

l=0: 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3: 7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4: 9 * 0.0506 ≈ 0.4554.

Sum all these:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419.

3.5419 +3.355 =6.8969.

6.8969 +1.75 =8.6469.

8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023.

So B≈9.1023.

Then, Im(f(0,0)) = B/k ≈ 9.1023 / 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Calculating 9.1023 / 0.253 → approximately 35.97 fm.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm, that's around 36 fm, but the options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Wait, this is way off. So my approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k. Let's double-check the calculation of k.

Wait, E=50 MeV, but perhaps I should compute k as p/ħ, where p is in units of MeV/c, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)/c^2 → Wait, no, more accurately:

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2).

E=50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So pc = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV.

Thus, p = (50 MeV)/c.

Then, k = p/ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) ) * (c / 1) ) → because ħ c is in MeV fm.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's express ħ in units of MeV·fm/c.

Wait, let me use the formula:

k = (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * c.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Another approach: I know that ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) = 5.06e-3 fm^{-1} (MeV)^{-1}.

Then, since p c =50 MeV,

k = p / ħ = ( p c )/( ħ c ) ) * (1/c).

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute k as:

k = (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * c → simplifies to (p c) / (ħ c) ) = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}, same as before.

So back to Im(f(0,0)) = B/k ≈9.1023 / 0.253 ≈35.97 fm.

But the options don't include this. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula for the imaginary part. Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, no, the earlier approach considered e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) which includes the sin and cos terms, but perhaps the correct formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) (sin 2 delta_l) P_l(cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta, phi) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] P_l(cos theta) e^{i phi}.

Because e^{i delta_l} = cos delta_l + i sin delta_l,

so e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l = sin delta_l (cos delta_l + i sin delta_l) = sin delta_l cos delta_l + i sin^2 delta_l.

So the real part is (2l+1) sin delta_l cos delta_l, and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

But wait, another possibility is that the phase shift delta_l is the phase of the scattering amplitude in the partial wave, so the partial wave amplitude is f_l = (2l+1)/(k) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the partial wave amplitudes.

The partial wave amplitude f_l is given by f_l = (2l+1)/(k) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l).

Wait, then the real part of f_l is (2l+1)/(k) sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l),

and the imaginary part is (2l+1)/(k) sin^2(delta_l).

So the total scattering amplitude f(theta, phi) is the sum over l of f_l P_l(cos theta) e^{i phi}.

So when theta=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0, phi)= sum_{l} [ (2l+1)/(k) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] e^{i phi}.

Which is sum (2l+1)/(k) [ (sin delta_l) (cos delta_l + i sin delta_l) ] e^{i phi}.

So grouping terms, f(0, phi) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l) /k ] e^{i phi} + i [ sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) /k ] e^{i phi}.

So the real part is Re(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l) /k ] e^{i phi},

and the imaginary part is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) /k ] e^{i phi}.

Wait, but then the imaginary part of f is a term proportional to e^{i phi}, which is a complex exponential. So unless phi is zero, the imaginary part is not a real number. Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about it differently. The imaginary part of f is a real number. So perhaps the term I have for Im(f) is actually part of f's imaginary component.

Wait, perhaps I should write f as:

f(0, phi) = A e^{i phi} + i B e^{i phi},

where A = sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) cos(delta_l) /k,

and B = sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) /k.

So the real part of f is A e^{i phi}, and the imaginary part is B e^{i phi}.

Wait, but that would make the imaginary part a complex number, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for f is:

f(theta, phi) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] P_l(cos theta) e^{i phi} / k.

Which can be rewritten as:

f(theta, phi) = [ sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) P_l(cos theta) ] e^{i phi} /k.

So when theta=0, it's [ sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] e^{i phi} /k.

So the expression is (sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l)) * e^{i phi} /k.

Which is a complex number, so the imaginary part would be the imaginary component of this expression.

So to find Im(f(0, phi)), we can compute the imaginary part of [ sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] * e^{i phi}.

Which is equal to Im[ sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ) * e^{i phi} ]

= Im[ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ( cos(delta_l) + i sin(delta_l) ) ) * ( cos phi + i sin phi ) ]

= Im[ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) [ cos(delta_l) cos phi - sin(delta_l) sin phi ] + i (2l+1) sin(delta_l) [ cos(delta_l) sin phi + sin(delta_l) cos phi ] ) ]

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i, so:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) [ cos(delta_l) sin phi + sin(delta_l) cos phi ].

But [ cos(delta_l) sin phi + sin(delta_l) cos phi ] = sin(phi + delta_l).

So Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(phi + delta_l).

Hmm, this is getting complicated because it depends on phi.

But the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That is, theta=0, but phi can be any value. So perhaps the question is asking for the average over phi, or the maximum value.

Wait, if we take the average over phi, then the average of sin(phi + delta_l) is zero, because sin is symmetric around zero. So the average of Im(f) would be zero. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible value of the imaginary part, which would be when sin(phi + delta_l)=1 for all l. But that's unlikely, as the phase shifts delta_l are different for each l.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong, and the question is referring to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude when considering each partial wave's contribution.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the sum of the imaginary parts of each partial wave's contribution to the amplitude, then taking the imaginary part of the total. But I'm getting stuck.

Another thought: perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part, when summed over all the partial waves, is given by sum_{l} (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) /k.

Because each partial wave contributes an imaginary part of (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l)/k.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So, then the total imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) /k.

So let's compute that.

Earlier, I computed B = sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) =9.1023.

k is 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So B/k =9.1023 / 0.253 ≈35.97 fm.

But the options don't have this value. So either my calculation is wrong or I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps k has a factor I'm missing. Did I compute k correctly?

Wait, the correct formula for k is k = sqrt(2m E) / ħ.

Wait, no, more accurately, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy T is (p^2)/(2m), but E = T + m c^2. So for high energies, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic relation.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, for E=50 MeV,

pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈50 MeV.

So, p = (50 MeV)/c.

k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ c ) * (c/1) ) → because ħ c is in MeV fm.

Wait, no, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c ) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ) → the c's cancel out, so:

k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) =50/(197.33) fm^{-1} ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So same as before. So Im(f) = B/k =9.1023/0.253≈35.97 fm.

But the options don't include this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me recompute B:

l=0: (2*0+1) sin^2(90) →1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67). Let's compute sin(67) accurately. 67 degrees is sin(67)=0.92050485345.

So sin^2=0.84732239.

3 *0.84732239=2.541967.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55). sin(55)=0.81915204428 → sin^2=0.671022.

5 *0.671022=3.35511.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30). sin(30)=0.5 → sin^2=0.25. →7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13). sin(13)=0.2249510543 → sin^2=0.0505915.

9 *0.0505915≈0.4553235.

Now sum:

1 +2.541967=3.541967.

3.541967 +3.35511=6.897077.

6.897077 +1.75=8.647077.

8.647077 +0.4553235=9.1024005.

So B≈9.1024.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 9.1024 / 0.253 → let's compute it precisely.

9.1024 / 0.253 = approximately 35.97 fm.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is that the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(1) /k.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because e^{i delta} sin delta is the imaginary part.

Wait, another approach. The imaginary part of f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(theta) e^{i phi}.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) e^{i phi}.

Which would make Im(f) a complex number, but the problem is asking for the imaginary part, which would be the imaginary component of that, which depends on phi.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude at theta=0 and phi=0.

In that case, we have:

Im(f(0,0)) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(0 + delta_l) → because sin(phi + delta_l).

Wait, no, because earlier we had Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(phi + delta_l) /k.

At phi=0, this becomes sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(delta_l) /k = sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) /k.

Which is the same as before, B/k=35.97 fm.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) P_l(1) /k.

Because sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x.

Wait, let's compute that.

So for each l, term is (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) /k.

Compute sin(2 delta_l) for each l:

l=0: 2*90=180 degrees → sin(180)=0. So term is 1*0=0.

l=1: 2*67=134 degrees. Sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193 → approx 0.7193.

Term:3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:2*55=110 degrees → sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

Term:5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:2*30=60 → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. Term:7 *0.866≈6.062.

l=4:2*13=26 → sin(26)=0.4384. Term:9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum all terms:

0 +2.1579=2.1579.

+4.6985=6.8564.

+6.062≈12.9184.

+3.9456≈16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Then, Im(f) = sum/(k) =16.864 /0.253 ≈66.66 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is (2l+1) sin(delta_l) instead.

Wait, let's compute:

sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l):

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

Then, Im(f)=13.38205/k≈13.38205/0.253≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(1). But P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l)/k →13.38205/0.253≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is the sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(1) / (k).

Wait, but that gives the same as above.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the absolute value squared, but that would give a magnitude, not a single number.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the real part of the amplitude.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the correct formula is:

Im(f) = sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(cos theta) e^{i phi} /k.

Which in the case of theta=0, becomes:

Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) e^{i phi} /k.

So the imaginary part of this would be sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(phi)/k.

But since phi isn't given, perhaps the maximum value is when sin(phi)=1, giving sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l)/k.

Which is 13.38205/0.253≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total cross-section, sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0,0)).

If I compute sigma_total, perhaps I can find Im(f) from sigma_total.

But the problem doesn't provide sigma_total. So perhaps this approach won't help.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are given in radians, but the problem states they're in degrees. So maybe I should convert degrees to radians before computing the sines.

Wait, no, I did that earlier. Let me recheck:

Yes, I converted delta_l from degrees to radians when computing sin, but in the calculation of B, I used the sine of the delta in degrees, which is correct.

Wait, no, I think I didn't. Wait, in the calculation of sin(67), I used 67 degrees, which is correct. So that part is fine.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of f is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) e^{i delta_l} P_l(1) e^{i phi}.

Which would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) e^{i (delta_l + phi)}.

The imaginary part of this would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(delta_l + phi).

But without phi, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the amplitude at theta=0 and phi=0, so Im(f(0,0)).

Which would be sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(delta_l) /k → sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l)/k.

Which we computed as 35.97 fm.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach to compute k.

The wave number k is given by k = (sqrt(2m E))/ħ.

E is the kinetic energy, but wait, for high-energy electrons, E ≈ pc.

But perhaps the correct formula for k is:

k = (E)/(ħ c) * (1/(1 + (m c^2)/(E))^{1/2} )

But since E >> m c^2, the denominator approaches 1, so k ≈ E/(ħ c).

E is 50 MeV.

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of 1e-15 m (fm), but I think I'm correct.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times larger than my 35.97. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should have converted them to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, no, because sin(67 degrees) is the same as sin(67°), which is approximately 0.9205, which I used.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recompute B:

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67 degrees)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 * (0.8192)^2=5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=0.4554.

Sum:1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554=9.1023.

So B=9.1023.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 9.1023/0.253=35.97 fm.

Hmm, but option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10 in the calculation of k?

Wait, perhaps k is in 1/(fm), but when I compute k=0.253 fm^{-1}, then 1/k is 3.95 fm.

Wait, wait, 1/k is 1/0.253 ≈3.95 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no, 1/k is 3.95 fm.

Wait, but this is getting confusing. Let me check the unit conversions again.

Wait, I have:

k = p / ħ.

p = (50 MeV)/c.

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = (50 MeV c^{-1}).

So, p/ħ = (50 MeV c^{-1}) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ) → because ħ c is in MeV fm.

So, p/ħ = (50 MeV c^{-1} ) * (c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50 c / (197.33 fm) ).

But c in units of fm per second is a large number, but perhaps I should express it in terms of units that cancel out.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as:

k = (E) / (ħ c) ) * [1/(1 + (m c^2)/(E))^{1/2} ].

But for E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV, so sqrt(1 + (0.511/50) )≈1.005.

So, k ≈ E/(ħ c) ) =50 /197.33≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the energy is in keV instead of MeV? No, the question says 50 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me think differently.

Another approach: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(delta_l) e^{i phi}.

But since the question is about the imaginary part along the beam direction, perhaps phi=0, so e^{i phi}=1.

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * 0 → because e^{i delta_l} is separate.

Wait, no, earlier I think I got confused. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) e^{i phi}.

Which is a complex number, but the imaginary part would be zero unless I'm considering the imaginary part of the sum.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at theta=0, which is the same as the sum of the imaginary components of each partial wave.

Each partial wave contributes (2l+1) sin(delta_l) P_l(1) e^{i phi}.

The imaginary part of each partial wave is (2l+1) sin(delta_l) sin(phi) P_l(1).

But without knowing phi, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible value, which would be when sin(phi)=1 for each l.

So, the maximum imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) /k.

Which we computed as approx 52.85 fm, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the absolute value of the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I should take the square of B/k and find the options.

(35.97 fm)^2 ≈1294 fm². No, that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of the squares of the partial wave amplitudes.

Sum ( (2l+1) sin(delta_l) )^2 → (1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455 )^2 ?

Wait, no, that approach doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula. I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0,0)).

But without sigma_total given, I can't use this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the sum of (2lOkay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles like electrons scatter off a target, their scattering can be described using something called the scattering amplitude. And phase shifts are involved in that, right?

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ with specific values: 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. It says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess I only consider these five.

The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the phase shifts. The formula for f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) times the sum of e^{iδ_l} * (sin δ_l) times (2l+1) * (something related to Legendre polynomials?), but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as a sum from l=0 to l_max of [ ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) * ( sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) ) ] where P_l are Legendre polynomials. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Hmm, along the incident direction, the angle θ would be 0°, right? Because the incident beam is coming in, say, along the positive z-axis, so the direction of the beam is θ=0.

Wait, but when θ is 0, what happens to the Legendre polynomials? Oh right, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_0(x)=1, P_1(x)=x, so P_1(1)=1, etc. So for any l, P_l(1)=1.

So the scattering amplitude at θ=0 becomes (1/(2ik)) sum from l=0 to l_max of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but the problem is about the imaginary part. So I need to compute the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im(f(0)).

Wait, f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l. So that's (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But 2ik is in the denominator. Let me think about k. Oh, k is the wave number. Since the electrons are 50 MeV, I should calculate k. But wait, how?

The relation for the kinetic energy of an electron is T = (ħ²k²)/(2m). But wait, for non-relativistic speeds, but 50 MeV is a lot of energy. Wait, electrons have mass about 0.511 MeV/c². So 50 MeV is much more than that, so relativistic. Hmm, but how to find k?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the relation k = sqrt(8mE)/(ħ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps using the relativistic energy expression. Hmm, but I might be getting stuck here. Wait, wait, maybe the question gives us all the information we need without calculating k. Let me see the options; the answers are in fm, which is femtometers, 1e-15 meters. So the imaginary part is a length.

Wait, the formula for f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l. So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the imaginary part of this expression.

Wait, 2ik is 2i times k. So 1/(2ik) is -i/(2k). Because 1/i is -i. So 1/(2ik) = (-i)/(2k). So the expression becomes sum( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (-i)/(2k).

So f(0) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (-i)/(2k). So the imaginary part of f(0) is [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1)/(2k), since multiplying by -i would bring the imaginary part from that.

Wait, because (-i)/(2k) multiplied by the sum would give f(0), which has an imaginary part of [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1)/(2k). Because the real part would be zero since it's multiplied by -i.

So Im(f(0)) = [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k).

Now, I need to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l for l from 0 to 4. Let's see the given δ's: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°.

So l starts at 0, so l=0,1,2,3,4.

Compute each term:

For l=0: (2*0 +1) sin(90°) = 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67°). Let's compute sin(67). I think sin(60)=0.866, sin(67) is higher. Maybe approximately 0.92. Let me calculate it accurately.

Wait, 67 degrees. I can use calculator functions.

Wait, in real scenarios, I could use a calculator, but since I'm just thinking, let's proceed.

sin(67) ≈ 0.9205.

So 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: (2*2 +1)=5. sin(55)≈0.8192.

5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3: (7) * sin(30). sin(30)=0.5. So 7*0.5=3.5.

l=4: (9) * sin(13). sin(13)=approx 0.22495. 9 * 0.22495 ≈ 2.02455.

Now sum all these: 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615. Add 4.096 → 7.8575. Add 3.5 → 11.3575. Add 2.02455 → 13.38205.

So sum = approx 13.382.

Now, Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) = 13.382/(2k) = 6.691 / k.

Now I need to find k. Since the electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm a bit stuck on how to calculate k.

Wait, the energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. The mass-energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, so we need to use relativistic kinematics.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma m c^2. For electrons, E = 50 MeV. So gamma = E/(m c^2) = 50 / 0.511 ≈ 97.836.

The momentum p is gamma m v, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So solving for p: p = sqrt( (E/(c))^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, perhaps better to compute p in terms of E and m.

Wait, E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 → p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

But units might be tricky. Let's compute in natural units where c=1, and then adjust.

Wait, in natural units, E (MeV) = m (MeV/c²) c². So for electrons, m c² is 0.511 MeV.

So E is 50 MeV.

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.26) ≈ sqrt(2499.74) ≈ 49.9974 MeV/c.

Wait, so p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

The wave number k is given by k = p / (ħ c / ħ c) ? Wait, no. Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The relation between momentum and wave number is p = ħ k. So k = p / ħ.

Wait, but in units where ħ c is a known value.

Wait, I think ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 m). So 197.33 MeV fm is the value, because (ħ c ≈ 197.33 × 10^{-15} J·m, but MeV·fm is a convenient unit).

So p = 50 MeV/c → but wait, since p is in MeV/c, and k = p/(ħ c) → so k in 1/fm.

Hmm, let's compute k = p/(ħ c). Since p is 50 MeV/c, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (c in denominator) ?

Wait, let me think: 1/(ħ c) has units of fm^{-1}.

Wait, p is in MeV/c. So when you divide by (ħ c) in MeV fm, you get (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) → (1/(c fm)) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for k:

k = (p c)/(ħ c^2) ) ?

Wait, not sure. Let me think.

p = ħ k → k = p/(ħ).

But p is in MeV/c, ħ is in MeV fm (since ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ is (197.33 MeV fm) / c. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so (ħ c) = 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

But that's not helping. Maybe I should use the approximation that for high energies, E ≈ pc, which is true for relativistic particles. So p ≈ E/c. So p = 50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ ) → but ħ is in J·s, but maybe in terms of MeV·fm/c, since ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, perhaps I can express k in terms of (MeV/c) divided by (ħ c) in MeV fm.

Wait, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ) = c/(197.33 MeV fm).

So, k = p/( ħ ) = (50 MeV/c) * c/(197.33 MeV fm) ) = 50 / 197.33 * (1/fm) ) → approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, let me be precise. Because ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / ( ħ ), but since ħ = (ħ c) / c, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, p is 50 MeV/c. So p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) = (50 / 197.33) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in units here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since k = p / ħ, and p is in MeV/c, ħ is in MeV·fm/c (since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c). So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ) = (50 / 197.33 ) (1/(fm)) ) → approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So now, Im(f(0)) = 6.691 / k → 6.691 / 0.253 fm⁻¹ = 6.691 * 0.253 fm → approximately 1.691 fm? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the options are 87,000, 355, 177, 251. So my calculation must be wrong somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula for the imaginary part. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So f(0) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2ik) )

The imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary component of this expression. Since 1/(2ik) can be written as (-i)/(2k), because 1/i is -i.

So ( -i )/(2k) multiplied by the sum. So the sum is a real number, so f(0) is purely imaginary. So Im(f(0)) is (sum) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, so Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2k) )

So the sum was 13.382, as calculated before.

So Im(f(0)) = 13.382/(2k) → approx 6.691 / k.

Hmm, and earlier I thought k was about 0.253 fm⁻¹, so 6.691 / 0.253 → approximately 26.45 fm.

But the options are around 177, 251, etc. So that's way off. So I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I think I should compute k correctly. Let's go back.

Energy E is 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV. So, using the relativistic energy formula:

E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 → (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2.

So, E = 50 MeV, m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So (p c)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.74.

So p c ≈ sqrt(2499.74) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So p = (49.997 MeV) / c → approximately 50 MeV/c.

Now, the wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ). But let's express it properly.

ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = 50 MeV/c → so k = p / ħ → (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So substituting,

k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ) → (50 MeV/c) * (c/(197.33 MeV fm)) )

The c's cancel, and MeV's cancel, so k = 50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ → approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's what I did before. So why the discrepancy in the result?

Wait, but wait, the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum/(2k). So sum is about 13.382, k is 0.253.

So 13.382 / (2 * 0.253) → 13.382 / 0.506 → approx 26.45 fm.

But the answer choices are much larger. So either I messed up the sum, or perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees? No, the question says 90°, etc., so they're in degrees. But wait, that's a problem because in calculations, we use radians.

Ah! Oh, right! Because when computing sine functions, the angle must be in radians. I made a mistake by using degrees. So I need to convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin.

Oh, that's a big mistake. So let's redo the sum correctly.

Compute each (2l+1)*sin(δ_l in radians):

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 radians. sin(π/2)=1. So term is 1.

l=1: δ=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937) ≈ 0.9205. So 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: δ=55° → 55 * π/180 ≈ 0.95993 radians. sin(0.95993) ≈ 0.8192. 5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3: δ=30° → π/6 ≈ 0.5236 radians. sin(0.5236)=0.5. 7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: δ=13° → 0.22689 radians. sin(0.22689)≈0.22495. 9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Wait, so the sum is 1 + 2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455 = 13.382, same as before. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the formula for k. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the wave number k is given by sqrt(8 m E) / (2 ħ), but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, the formula for k when E is the kinetic energy.

Wait, for non-relativistic cases, E = (ħ² k²)/(2m), so k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But in our case, 50 MeV is way higher than the rest mass, so relativistic approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the energy into Joules, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the wavelength and the momentum.

Wait, another thought: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by the formula Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l)/(2k), as before.

We have sum =13.382. So Im(f)=13.382/(2k).

But wait, what's the unit of k? Since k is in 1/fm, and we're computing Im(f) in fm.

So, if k is 0.253 fm⁻¹, then:

Im(f) = 13.382/(2 *0.253) fm → 13.382/(0.506) ≈ 26.45 fm.

But none of the options are near 26. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula involves the sum multiplied by (1/(2ik)) and then taking the imaginary part. So perhaps the actual formula is different.

Wait, let me reevaluate the formula.

The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

So, e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So, when we expand f(θ), it has a real and imaginary part.

So, f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l P_l.

= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i (sin δ_l)^2 ] P_l.

= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ (sin 2 δ_l ) / 2 + i (sin δ_l)^2 ] P_l.

At θ=0, P_l=1. So:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ (sin 2 δ_l )/2 + i (sin δ_l )^2 ].

This can be written as:

f(0) = [ sum (2l+1) (sin 2 δ_l )/2 ] * (1/(2ik)) + i [ sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 ] * (1/(2ik)).

Wait, but 1/(2ik) is -i/(2k). So,

f(0) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ] * (-i/(2k)) + i [ sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 ] * (-i/(2k)).

Let's compute each term:

First term: [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ] * (-i/(2k)).

Second term: i * [ sum ... ] * (-i/(2k)).

i * (-i) = 1. So,

Second term becomes [ sum ... ] * (1/(2k)).

So, f(0) has an imaginary part from the second term.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should go back to the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(2k))).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but earlier calculation leads to Im(f(0))= ~26.45 fm, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly. Let's do that again.

E =50 MeV.

p c = sqrt( E^2 – (m c^2)^2 ) → E=50 MeV, m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

So (p c )^2 =50^2 – (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 – 0.261 → 2499.739.

p c ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.997 MeV.

p =49.997 MeV/c → approximately 50 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ → p is 50 MeV/c → and ħ = (197.33 MeV fm)/c → because ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) → the c's cancel, MeV cancels, so k =50 /197.33 fm⁻¹ → approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) → 13.382/(2 * 0.253) → 13.382/(0.506) → approx 26.44 fm.

But the options are much larger, so perhaps I missed a factor. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot that the amplitude is given in units of 1e-15 meters (fm), but maybe the actual calculation requires a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. Wait, but that might not help here.

Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 2. Because in the original formula, f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l... So maybe when taking the imaginary part, it's sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(2k)).

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So I'm stumped.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the cross-section σ is proportional to |f|^2, but that's about the magnitude squared.

Wait, perhaps the actual calculation requires that the answer is about 177.675 fm. Which is option C.

But why?

Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let me think about units. ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

p is 50 MeV/c → so ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → so p =50 MeV/c → k= p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) → but since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm, then ħ=197.33 MeV fm / c.

So, k= (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) → the c cancels, leaving 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate k in units of inverse meters, but that seems more involved.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as (sqrt(2 m E) ) / ħ. But E is 50 MeV.

Wait, but E here is the kinetic energy, which is 50 MeV. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, no, no. For relativistic particles, E is the total energy, which includes rest mass. So, E = γ m c² =50 MeV.

So, the momentum p is given by E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

So, p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) / c → approx 50 MeV/c.

Hmm. So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) ) → 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum/(2k) → 13.382/(2 * 0.253) → 13.382/0.506 → approx 26.44 fm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l (sin δ_l + i cos δ_l) P_l. Wait, no, I think the correct expansion is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l.

Which expands to sum [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) ( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l ] P_l.

So, the real part comes from the cos δ_l sin δ_l terms, and the imaginary part from the sin² δ_l terms.

At θ=0, P_l=1. So f(0) = sum [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ].

So, f(0) = real_part + i * imaginary_part.

So, the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) sin² δ_l ].

Wait a minute! So I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct expression for the imaginary part is sum( (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) * (1/(2k) )

So, Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Ah! So that's the mistake. I was using sin δ, not sin² δ.

Oh! So, I need to compute sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Let me recompute the sum.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin²(67)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²(55)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=0.4554.

Now sum these:

1 + 2.5419=3.5419 → +3.355=6.8969 → +1.75=8.6469 → +0.4554=9.1023.

So sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now, Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) = 9.1023/(2k) → 9.1023/(2*0.253) fm → 9.1023/(0.506) → approx 17.98 fm.

Hmm, 18 fm, but the options are around 177, 251, etc.

Wait, maybe the sum is wrong. Let me recheck the calculations.

l=0: 1 *1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67). Let me compute sin(67) again accurately.

67 degrees: sin(67)=0.9205048534526453.

So squared: (0.9205)^2 ≈0.8473.

3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²(55)=5*(0.81915204428)². 0.81915^2≈0.671.

So 5 *0.671=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(sin(13))^2. sin(13)=0.2249510543 → squared≈0.0506105.

9*0.0506105≈0.4554945.

So sum is 1+2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554945=9.1023945.

So sum is ~9.1024.

k is 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1024/(2 *0.253) =9.1024/(0.506) → 17.98 fm → approx 18 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula again. Let me check the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Another source: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So, that's what I did.

Wait, but perhaps I should include all the phase shifts l from 0 to L, and in this case, L=4, which I did.

Hmm. I'm not getting any of the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, maybe the wave number k is calculated differently. Let me calculate k in a different way.

Given E=50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy? Or the total energy?

Wait, the problem states "50 MeV electrons", which probably refers to their kinetic energy, but for high-energy electrons, the total energy is much larger than the rest mass. But perhaps I should treat E as kinetic energy. Let me try that.

If E is kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (p^2)/(2m).

Wait, but for high energies, relativistic effects are significant. Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach isn't valid here, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the electron's wavelength.

The wavelength λ is given by λ = h/(p), where h is Planck's constant, and p is momentum.

But h = 2π ħ.

So, λ = 2π ħ / p.

But p = gamma m v, and for relativistic speeds, v≈c.

So p ≈ gamma m c.

But gamma is E/(m c^2) → E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So gamma =50 / 0.511 ≈97.836.

So p= gamma m c → p= (50 MeV/c) (since E=gamma m c^2 → p=gamma m c).

So, p=50 MeV/c.

So, λ = h/(p) = (2π ħ c)/(p c) ) → because h = 2π ħ c.

So, λ = (2π ħ c) / (p c) ) → λ = (2π ħ c)/(p c) ) = (2π ħ ) / p.

Since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm/c.

So, λ = 2π * (197.33 MeV fm/c) ) / (50 MeV/c) ) → the c and MeV cancel, leaving:

λ=2π * 197.33 fm /50 → 2π * 3.9466 fm → approx 24.78 fm.

So, wave number k=2π/λ → 2π/(24.78 fm) ≈0.251 fm⁻¹. Which is close to what I found before. So that's correct.

So, Im(f(0))=9.1024/(2*0.251) →9.1024/0.502 → approx 18.13 fm.

Still, the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 or something.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of 10^(-something), but no, the question doesn't indicate that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/k).

Wait, but that would give Im(f)=13.382/(0.253) → 52.85 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(2k)) → which as before.

Wait, but maybe the phase shifts are in radians, which I had already considered.

Wait, perhaps the sum is for l=0 to 4, but maybe I missed higher l's. But the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so we consider l=0 to 4 only.

Hmm. Looking back at the options, the closest I've gotten is around 18 fm, but the options are 177, 251, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Let me recheck each term.

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90) =1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67):

sin(67)≈0.9205 → squared is 0.8473 → 3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5* sin^2(55) =5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7* sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9* sin^2(13)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=0.4554.

Sum is 1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554=9.1023.

So, sum is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k).

Which gives 13.382/(2 *0.253) → 13.382/(0.506)≈26.44 fm.

But even so, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should take into account the reduced mass of the system. Oh! Because in electron scattering from a nucleus, the reduced mass μ is (m_e * m_N)/(m_e + m_N), where m_N is the mass of the nucleus. But if the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, μ≈m_e.

But perhaps the correct formula for k is sqrt(8 μ E)/(2 ħ).

Wait, but if the target is a nucleus, which is much heavier, μ≈m_e.

So, earlier calculation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is sqrt(2 m E) / ħ, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the relation between energy and wavelength.

E = h f → and λ = h/p → p= h/λ.

But E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2).

So, p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) / c.

So, k = p/ħ = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) / ( ħ c ).

Which is what I did earlier.

So, k= sqrt(50^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / (197.33) → sqrt(2499.74) ≈49.997 → 49.997 /197.33 → approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, same result.

Hmm. Maybe the initial approach was wrong, and the correct formula involves the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, but without the square. Which would give 13.382/(2 *0.253)=26.44 fm.

But that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l.

At θ=0, P_l=1.

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l.

Which becomes (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ].

So, f(0) = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ]/(2ik) + i [ sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2ik).

The imaginary part comes from the second term.

Since 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), the second term becomes i * [ sum ... ] * (-i/(2k) ) → which is [ sum ... ] * (1/(2k) ) because i*(-i) =1.

So the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ] / (2k).

Which is what I calculated as 9.1023/(2*0.253)=approx 18.13 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in units where ħ=1, and perhaps I should adjust the calculation accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the function f is in units that require a different conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] → which would be same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should include all the terms l=0 to 4.

Wait, l=0:1 * sin^2(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67)=3*(0.9205)^2≈3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=0.4554.

Sum=1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554=9.1023.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of my calculations match the options. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(2k)).

Which gives 13.382/(2*0.253)=26.44 fm → but not matching.

Hmm.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

Which is approximately 177.68 fm.

Wait, 177.68 is approximately 18.7 *10 → but how to reach that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in converting degrees to radians. Wait, no, because I correctly converted δ_l to radians before computing sin.

Wait another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are for the same l as given, but perhaps the maximum l is 4, so I should sum up to l=4.

Which I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k).

Which would be 13.382/0.253→52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the formula Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/(2k)).

Which gives 13.382/(2*0.253)=26.44 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/k).

Which gives 13.382/0.253≈52.85 fm.

But none of these options are present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, let me recalculate k with more precision.

E=50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

E²= (50)^2 =2500.

(m c²)^2= (0.511)^2≈0.261.

So (p c)^2=E^2 - (m c^2)^2=2500 - 0.261=2499.739.

p c = sqrt(2499.739)=49.997 MeV.

So p=49.997 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ) =49.997 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) →49.997/(197.33) fm⁻¹ →0.25305 fm⁻¹.

So, Im(f)= sum/(2k) →13.382/(2*0.25305)=13.382/(0.5061)=26.44 fm.

Hmm.

But the options are much larger. Perhaps the formula is different. Another possibility: the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l.

In that case, Im(f) would be the imaginary part of that, which would be sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(2k)).

Which would give 13.382/(2*0.253)=26.44 fm.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the real part instead of the imaginary part. But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2i k)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l → so f(θ)= (1/(2i k)) sum (2l+1) (sin δ_l + i cos δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which would make f(θ) = (1/(2i k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l + i (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ].

The imaginary part would then be (1/(2i k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l → which is (sum ... ) * (-i)/(2k).

Wait, but the imaginary part of that would be (sum ... ) * (1)/(2k), because (1/(2i k)) * something is (-i/(2k)) * something. But the imaginary part comes from the coefficient.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too tangled up. Maybe I should think differently. Since none of the options match my calculations, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me try another way.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is given by k= sqrt(8 m E)/ (2 ħ) → but that's the non-relativistic formula. Let's see.

E=50 MeV, but that's relativistic.

But for the sake of trying, let's compute non-relativistic k.

E_kinetic= (1/2) m v^2 → but for electrons, E=50 MeV is much higher than their rest mass, so non-relativistic approach isn't valid.

But let's try.

E_kinetic =50 MeV =50e6 eV.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

But converting E to Joules: 1 eV=1.602e-19 J. So 50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 =8.01e-13 J.

E_kinetic= (1/2) m v² → v= sqrt(2 E/(m)).

v= sqrt(2 *8.01e-13 J / (9.109e-31 kg)) ) → 2 *8.01e-13 =1.602e-12 → 1.602e-12 /9.109e-31 ≈1.758e+18 → sqrt(1.758e18)=approx 4.193e9 m/s. Which is way higher than c (3e8 m/s), so relativistic.

So that approach is invalid.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

But I can't see where I made a mistake to get to that value. Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 6.626 to get to a larger number, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the sum again. Let me compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5*sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin(13)=9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.382.

So sum is 13.382.

Wait, then Im(f)=sum/(2k)=13.382/(2*0.253)=26.44 fm.

But this isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of k is wrong. Let's compute k accurately.

k= p/(ħ).

p=50 MeV/c.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ=197.33 MeV fm /c.

So, k= p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) → 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

But I'm not sure how to reach that. Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply the sum by (2π) or something, but I can't think of why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiplies by (1/(2k)) and then multiplies by 1e-15 m to convert fm⁻¹ to fm.

Wait, but no, k is in fm⁻¹, so when you divide sum by k, you get fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation requires sum/(2k) multiplied by (1e-15 m), but that's already in fm.

I think I'm stuck and can't find the error in my approach. So, given the options, and considering that my Im(f) is about 26.44 fm but none of the options match, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct Im(f) is sum/(k), giving 13.382/0.253≈52.85 fm, which is still not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation of the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l. Let me compute each term again.

l=0: 1* sin(90)=1 → 1.

l=1:3 * sin(67 degrees)=3 * 0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55 degrees)=5 * 0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30°)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°)=9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.382.

So, sum is correct.

Hmm. If I take sum/(2k) =13.382/(2*0.253)=26.44 fm, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum * (1/k).

Which would be 13.382/0.253=52.85 fm. Still no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum * (1/(k)) , but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by 2, leading to 26.44 *2=52.88 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic energy and calculate the Compton wavelength.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 177.68 fm.

Wait, 177.68 is approximately 6.69 times 26.44.

Wait, 6.69 times 26.44 is about 177.68.

Hmm, but why would that factor come into play?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(k)).

Which would give 13.382/0.253=52.85 fm.

But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, and I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere. But I can't see where.

Another possibility: perhaps the sum I calculated is 13.382, but in reality, I should have summed (2l+1) sin δ_l, but δ_l is in radians, not degrees. Oh wait, no, I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the exact value of k.

k=50 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm /c )=50/(197.33) fm⁻¹=0.25305 fm⁻¹.

So, perhaps the precise calculation would be 13.382/(2*0.25305)=13.382/(0.5061)=26.44 fm.

But no.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that none of the calculations match the options, but given the options, the closest is option C) 177.675 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), using the given phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived from the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \)
For each \( l \), compute \( (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \) and sum the results:

- \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419 \)
- \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 \approx 3.355 \)
- \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554 \)

Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is given by:
\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar}, \quad \text{where } p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{c}
\]
For \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
p c = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} = \sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2} \approx \sqrt{2500 - 0.261} \approx 49.997 \, \text{MeV}
\]
Thus:
\[
p = \frac{49.997 \, \text{MeV}}{c}, \quad k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{49.997 \, \text{MeV}/c}{197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm}/c} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
Using the formula:
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l}{2k}
\]
Substitute \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2 \delta_l \approx 9.1023 \) and \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{9.1023}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{9.1023}{0.506} \approx 17.98 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 17.98 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately \( 10 \times \) the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of \( 10 \) in the problem setup or interpretation, but based on the given options, the most reasonable choice is:
