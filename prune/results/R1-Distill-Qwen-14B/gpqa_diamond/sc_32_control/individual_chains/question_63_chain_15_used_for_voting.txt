Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, and we're looking for the momentum of a photon that causes a transition. 

So, the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we want it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I remember that in such models, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational parts. But wait, the question specifies using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So for vibration, the fundamental state is n=0, and for rotation, it's probably the lowest rotational state, which is J=0 or maybe J=1? Hmm, I think for diatomic molecules, the rotation starts at J=0, then J=1, etc., but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, no, actually in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized, and the energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So the ground state would be J=0. 

But wait, the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest energy. So the molecule is in its ground state, and it absorbs a photon to go to the next possible state. Now, the next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But wait, if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational (n=0) and lowest rotational (J=0) state, then the next state would involve the next possible energy level. But the energy levels are a combination of both, so the next state would be either a higher J or a higher n.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The energy of the molecule in the ro-vibrational model is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. So E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy is E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

The ground state is when n=0 and J=0, so E_ground = (0 + 1/2) h w + 0 = (1/2) h w. The next higher energy states would be either n=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state), but which of these has a lower energy? Because the photon has to have enough energy to cause a transition to the next state, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So we need to find which transition requires the least energy.

Wait, but the photon's energy must match the difference between the initial and final states. So the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0). Let's calculate the energies for the possible next states.

The vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 would require an energy of E_v = h w. Because (n=1) is (1 + 1/2) h w and (n=0) is (0 + 1/2) h w, so the difference is h w.

For rotational transitions, the J=0 to J=1 transition would require E_r = B [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] = 2B. So the energy required is 2B. 

We need to compare h w and 2B to see which is lower. So which one is smaller? Let me calculate both.

First, given data:
Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.
Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but how do we compute B, the rotational constant? The rotational constant B is given by (h)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, another formula I remember is B = (h)/(8 π² I), but I think I might be mixing it up with the rotational energy. Let me get that right. 

The rotational constant B is defined as (h)/(8 π² I c), where c is the speed of light. Wait, no, I think I might be confusing B with the rotational energy. Alternatively, perhaps B has units of cm^-1. Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula again. Oh, right, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B has units of energy per rotational quantum number. Alternatively, sometimes B is given in terms of wavenumbers, which is in cm^-1, but that's another topic.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for B is:

B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), where I is the moment of inertia, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Or perhaps B = (h)/(8 π² I c), where c is the speed of light. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the rotational constant B can be calculated using B = (h)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia and c is the speed of light. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Ah, yes, the reduced mass μ is important. So I = μ R². The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let's calculate μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, I need to convert amu to kilograms because the standard units are in SI.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

So I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), where k is Boltzmann's constant? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps B is calculated as B = (h)/(8 π² I c), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's better to find the formula for the rotational energy levels.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = (ℏ²)/(2 I), and ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct expression for B.

Wait, another approach. The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is h/(2π).

So E_J = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I)

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = (h² * 1 * 2)/(8 π² I) - 0 = (2 h²)/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I)

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me reevaluate. 

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is often expressed as (h)/(8 π² I c), where c is the speed of light, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the rotational constant in wavenumbers (cm^-1) is given by B̃ = (h c)/(8 π² I), where c is the speed of light. 

Wait, perhaps it's best to compute B as (h²)/(8 π² I k), but I'm getting myself confused. Let me look for another approach. 

Wait, perhaps I can compute the rotational energy for J=0 and J=1.

E_J = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I)

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=(h² *1*2)/(8 π² I) = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I)

So the energy required for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot = h²/(4 π² I)

We need to compute this value and compare it to the vibrational energy transition, which is E_vib = h w.

So let's compute both E_rot and E_vib.

First, compute E_rot:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

I = 1.2068e-46 kg·m²

Compute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.390e-67 (J² s²)

Divide by (4 π² I): 

4 π² ≈ 39.478

So denominator: 4 π² I = 39.478 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 4.765e-45

So E_rot = (4.390e-67) / (4.765e-45) = 9.21e-23 J

Wait, wait: 4.39e-67 / 4.765e-45 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Now, compute E_vib = h w.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

w = 4e14 rad/s

E_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, compare E_rot (9.21e-23 J) and E_vib (2.65e-19 J). E_rot is much smaller than E_vib, so the rotational transition requires less energy. Wait, that can't be right. Because a photon with energy E_photon must match the energy difference between the states. 

Wait, but according to these calculations, the rotational transition requires 9.21e-23 J, while the vibrational transition requires 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. But wait, in the ground state, which is n=0 and J=0, the next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, because that requires less energy than moving to n=1.

Wait, but that would mean that the molecule would preferentially undergo a rotational transition before a vibrational one, given the same photon energy. Hmm, but that might not be the case, because the vibrational energy spacing is much larger. Wait, but according to our calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. So if the photon's energy is lower than the vibrational transition, it can cause a rotational transition. But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we need to switch to the next state. So which transition is possible first?

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, let's compute E_rot again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

I = 1.2068e-46 kg m²

E_rot = (h² )/(4 π² I) = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (4 * (pi^2) * 1.2068e-46 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 squared is approx (6.626)^2 * 1e-68 = 43.9 * 1e-68 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 4 * pi^2 ≈ 4 * 9.8696 ≈ 39.4784.

So denominator is 39.4784 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 39.4784 * 1.2068e-46.

Wait, 39.4784 * 1.2068e-46 = approx 47.64e-46 = 4.764e-45.

So E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.764e-45 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, but that's much smaller than the vibrational energy transition, which is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition has a lower energy. So the molecule would transition to J=1 before considering a vibrational transition. Therefore, the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the molecule absorbs a photon with energy matching the rotational transition, it will go to J=1, n=0, which is a higher energy than the ground state (J=0, n=0), but the energy required is lower than the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy should be E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The question is phrased as switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next possible state would be the one with the smallest energy increase. So the molecule is in the state with the lowest possible energy, and the next possible states would be either J=1 (same vibrational state, n=0) or n=1 (same rotational state, J=0). The lower energy transition is the rotational one, so the photon's energy is E_rot.

But wait, the initial state is the ground state (n=0, J=0). If the photon's energy is E_rot, the molecule transitions to J=1, n=0. But perhaps the molecule can also transition to n=1, J=0, which would have a higher energy. So the question is which transition is lower in energy.

Wait, but we've calculated E_rot to be 9.21e-23 J, and E_vib to be 2.65e-19 J, so E_rot is about 4 orders of magnitude lower. So the photon's energy would need to be 9.21e-23 J to cause the rotational transition. So the energy of the photon is E_photon = E_final - E_initial = E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, right! Because the photon's energy E is related to its momentum p by E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-27 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But looking at the options, the numbers are much higher, like 1.9e-28, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation of E_rot. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me recompute E_rot more accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
I = μ R² = (20*2/(20+2)) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, let me compute μ again.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

μ = (20/11) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg
= (1.81818) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg
= Approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2
= 3.017e-27 kg * 4e-20 m²
= 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Now, E_rot = (h²)/(8 π² I).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the correct formula for E_J is (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I). For J=1, the energy is (2 h²)/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

So E_rot = h²/(4 π² I).

Compute h²: (6.62607015e-34)^2 ≈ 4.390478e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 4 * π² * I = 4 * (9.8696) * 1.2068e-46.

4 * 9.8696 ≈ 39.4784.

39.4784 * 1.2068e-46 = let's compute that step by step.

39.4784 * 1e-46 = 3.94784e-45. Multiply by 1.2068: 3.94784e-45 * 1.2068 ≈ 4.764e-45.

So denominator is 4.764e-45.

E_rot = 4.390478e-67 / 4.764e-45 = approx 9.214e-23 J.

Yes, same as before.

Now, E_photon = E_rot = 9.214e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.214e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.071e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are in the range of 1e-27 Ns. Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than the options given.

Hmm, so perhaps I've made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition not just a rotational or vibrational change, but a combination of both? Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be n=1, J=0. Or maybe J=0, n=1. Alternatively, perhaps it's the first allowed transition, which could be a vibrational transition with a rotational change (like n=0 to n=1 with J changing), but that might complicate things.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That would be the state that is the next in energy higher than the current state. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase.

So we need to find the energy of the next possible state after the ground state (n=0, J=0). The possible next states would be either (n=0, J=1), (n=1, J=0), (n=1, J=1), etc. We need to find which of these is the next state with the smallest energy.

So let's compute the energy for each possible state.

E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

E_vibrational = (n + 1/2) h w.

E_rotational = B J (J+1).

Wait, but I'm not sure about B. Let me calculate B correctly.

Hmm, perhaps B is given by B = (h)/(8 π² I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is E_J = (J (J+1) h c B)/ (something). Wait, I think it's better to use the correct formula for B.

The rotational constant B (in terms of cm^-1) is given by B̃ = h / (8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia, and c is the speed of light in cm/s.

But wait, in terms of energy, E_J would be (J (J+1)) * h c B̃.

So E_J = J (J+1) h c B̃.

Wait, B̃ is in cm^-1, which is 1/cm, so E_J would be in energy units when multiplied by h c.

So let me compute B̃:

B̃ = h / (8 π² I c).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

I = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

c = 3e8 m/s.

But wait, c in cm/s is 3e10 cm/s.

So B̃ = h / (8 π² I c) = 6.626e-34 J·s / (8 π² * 1.2068e-46 kg·m² * 3e10 cm/s).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the units need to be consistent. Let me make sure all units are in cm.

Wait, I is in kg·m². Let me convert I into g·cm², because it's easier for B̃.

1 kg = 1000 g.

1 m = 100 cm.

So I = 1.2068e-46 kg·m² = 1.2068e-46 * 1000 g * (100 cm)^2 = 1.2068e-46 * 1000 * 1e4 cm²·g.

Wait, 1 kg = 1e3 g, 1 m = 1e2 cm.

So I = 1.2068e-46 kg·m² = 1.2068e-46 * 1e3 g * (1e2 cm)^2 = 1.2068e-46 * 1e3 * 1e4 cm²·g = 1.2068e-46 * 1e7 g·cm² = 1.2068e-39 g·cm².

Wait, but this seems complicated. Perhaps it's easier to compute B̃ in cm^-1 using the original I in kg·m².

Wait, let me compute B̃ in cm^-1.

B̃ = h / (8 π² I c).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s = 6.626e-34 (kg·m²/s²)·s = 6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

I is 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

c = 3e10 cm/s.

So plug in the numbers:

B̃ = (6.626e-34 kg·m²/s) / (8 π² * 1.2068e-46 kg·m² * 3e10 cm/s )

Wait, let me compute the denominator:

8 π² ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.15e-46.

95.15e-46 * 3e10 cm/s = 2.8545e-34 cm/s.

So B̃ = 6.626e-34 / 2.8545e-34 = approximately 2.32 cm^-1.

So B̃ ≈ 2.32 cm^-1.

Now, the rotational energy for J=1 is E_J = J (J+1) * h c B̃.

So E_J = 1 * 2 * h c * B̃.

h c = 12400 eV·Å (approx), but wait, let me compute it in Joules.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

But since B̃ is in cm^-1, let me convert h c into cm.

Wait, 1 m = 100 cm, so h c = 1.9878e-25 J·m = 1.9878e-23 J·cm.

So E_J = 2 * 1.9878e-23 J·cm * 2.32 cm^-1.

Hmm, cm and cm^-1 will cancel.

So E_J = 2 * 1.9878e-23 * 2.32 = approx 2 * 4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

Which matches our earlier calculation of E_rot as 9.21e-23 J. So that's correct.

Now, E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is J=1, n=0, requiring E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is E/c.

p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are in the order of 1e-27 N·s. Wait, 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s, so 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are that small. The options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C) 1.1e-27, D) 1.4e-28.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Because my calculated momentum is way lower than any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next vibrational state (n=1, J=0), but that would require E_photon = E_vib = 2.65e-19 J. Let's compute its momentum.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 N·s.

But none of the options match this either. The closest option is D) 1.4e-28, but it's about a third of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B̃ and E_J. Let me double-check the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which is a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. For example, maybe the photon's energy must account for both a change in vibrational and rotational states. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=0), which would involve only the vibrational transition. But in that case, the energy would be E_vib = h w = 2.65e-19 J, as before.

Wait, but the options don't have anything close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rigid rotor model where the rotational energy is E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in terms of energy. Wait, perhaps I should compute B differently.

Wait, another approach: the rotational constant B is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), where k is Boltzmann's constant?

Wait, no, I think that's for the energy in terms of temperature. No, I'm confusing different constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for B is B = ħ²/(2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So E_J = B J (J+1).

Yes, because E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I).

So let me compute B as B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ = h/(2 π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²).

So B = (h²/(4 π²)) / (2 I) ) = h²/(8 π² I).

Which is the same as what I used earlier. So E_J = B J (J+1) = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I).

So the earlier calculation of E_rot = 9.21e-23 J should be correct.

Thus, the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 N·s, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is to find the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=0), which is the first allowed vibrational transition. But that requires a much larger energy.

Wait, but the options don't have values near 8.8e-28 N·s. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the photon's momentum for the transition to (n=0, J=1), which is 9.2e-23 J, as before.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of I.

Wait, I is μ R². Let me recompute μ.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

R is 2e-10 m, so R² = 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

That's correct.

So perhaps the issue is in the approach. Maybe the problem expects the transition to the next state in the vibrational mode, not the rotational. Or perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor-vibrator model and the transition is to the first vibrationally excited state with the lowest possible rotational state, so J=0, n=1.

In that case, the photon's energy would be E = (1 + 1/2 - 0 -1/2) h w = h w.

So E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of this value. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 0.21 of 8.83e-28. Not matching exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute E_photon again.

E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 s^-1 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg·m/s → 8.8347e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question refers to the transition to the next state in terms of the total energy, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. For example, a transition from (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1), which is the lowest possible energy increment.

But that brings us back to E_rot =9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 N·s, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of both vibrational and rotational changes, but that complicates the model beyond the fundamental consideration here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h w. Let me recheck.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, which would require the photon's momentum to be E_rot/(c) = 9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula for rotational energy again. The energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in Joules.

Wait, but what is B? B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), as we've used.

So E_J = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I).

So for J=1, E_J = (h² *2)/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

Yes, correct.

So E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the photon's energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational changes, but that would require a larger energy, which isn't matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to refer to the next state after the fundamental state, which is the first vibrational state (n=1), regardless of rotation. So the photon's energy is E_vib = h w.

Then p = E_vib/c = 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) 1.4e-28, which is about 1/6th of this value. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in a calculation.

Wait, let me compute 2.65e-19 J in eV to see if that's the issue.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 2.65e-19 J is about 1.65 eV. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's wavelength to be considered, but I don't think that would change the momentum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state (n=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1), but keeping the rotational state the same (J=0). So the photon's energy would be E = h w.

Thus, E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would be a higher energy than J=1, so it's not the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be calculated using the reduced mass in a different way, but I can't see where I might have gone wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

B = h²/(8 π² I).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I =1.2068e-46 kg·m².

So, 8 π² I = 8*(9.8696) *1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = approx 95.15e-46 =9.515e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.515e-45 = approx 4.61e-23 J.

E_rot for J=1 is B *2 = 9.22e-23 J. Which matches the earlier calculation.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to have the photon's energy as the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes, but that would be much higher. However, none of the options match that scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me check again.

Wait, I = μ R².

μ= (20*2)/(20+2) amu =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg → μ=3.017e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m → R²=4e-20 m².

I=3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2068e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stumped. The calculated momentum p is 3.07e-31 N·s for the rotational transition, and 8.83e-28 N·s for the vibrational transition. Neither matches the options provided. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which is (n=1, J=0), requiring E = h w.

So, E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about a sixth of this value. So not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0, n=0 to J=1, n=0. So p=3.07e-31 N·s. Not matching options.

Another thought: Wait, perhaps the question refers to the transition to the next state in terms of the vibrational state only, but in such a way that the photon's momentum is calculated using the bond length and the angular frequency.

Wait, the energy of the photon is h w, so p = h w /c.

Wait, that's the same as earlier. So p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, no matching options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the photon's momentum using the reduced mass and bond length in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula p = 2 π I w, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the angular momentum, which is L = I ω, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is asking about the photon's momentum when it causes the molecule to transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the first excited state. But which one? If the next state is the combination of n=1 and J=0, then the photon's energy is h w.

But again, no matching options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which introduces centrifugal distortion, but that complicates matters further.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the energy differences. Let me think again.

If the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy could be (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0). We need to find which of these requires less energy.

We have E_rot for J=1 as 9.2e-23 J, and E_vib for n=1 as 2.65e-19 J. Since 9.2e-23 < 2.65e-19, the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon's energy should be E_rot =9.2e-23 J.

Thus, p_photon =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different model where the next state is a rotational change with a vibrational change. For example, a photon that causes a change in both J and n.

But this is getting too complicated for the given question, which seems to suggest a simpler approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, regardless of rotational, which would require E_photon = h w.

But then p_photon =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D (1.4e-28), which is an order of magnitude smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me recheck.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 Hz =2.65e-19 J.

Wait, yes, because 1 Hz = 1 s^-1, so the units work out.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s =8.83e-28 kg·m/s =8.83e-28 N·s.

Hmm.

An alternative possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when it causes a transition to the next rotational state, but in a way that the calculation uses the moment of inertia in a different form.

Wait, maybe the problem considers the photon's momentum in terms of angular momentum. But that's not directly relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the photon's wavelength, but that's not the question.

Hmm. Given that none of the options match my calculations, I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). It's in its fundamental state, and we need to find the photon's momentum when it switches to the next state with the lowest energy.

So perhaps the next state after the fundamental state is the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0), which requires E = h w.

So p_photon = h w /c =6.626e-34 *4e14 /3e8 = (2.65e-19) /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences, but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, which might be a change in both n and J. For example, the next state after (n=0, J=0) could be (n=1, J=0), which requires E = h w.

But again, that leads to p=8.83e-28 N·s.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of J, regardless of n, which would be (n=0, J=1), requiring E_rot =9.2e-23 J.

But again, no matching options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Planck's constant or other constants. Let me recheck the constants.

h =6.62607015e-34 J·s exactly.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

But using c=3e8 should be fine.

Wait, perhaps using c=3e10 cm/s instead of m/s. Let me recalculate E_rot using c in cm/s.

E_rot =9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 J / (3e10 cm/s) → but wait, J is kg·m²/s², and momentum is kg·m/s.

Wait, no, using c in m/s is correct. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. The correct approach leads to a photon momentum not listed in the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the question is referring to the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require E= 3 h²/(8 π² I), but that would be even higher in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in a different way, such as the first overtone, but that would require twice the vibrational energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition within the same vibrational state but a change in rotational state, which would be the rotational transition.

So based on the calculation, the correct answer isn't among the options. But this can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert R from angstroms to meters correctly. Let me recheck.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom = 1e-10 meters. So R=2e-10 m. Correct.

So I think all calculations are correct.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 N·s, but I'm not sure how to arrive at that.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, and the photon's energy is E_rot = (h²)/(4 π² I).

Wait, but I have E_rot as 9.2e-23 J.

p =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for h. Let me check using h =4.135667696e-15 eV·s.

Wait, but that's a conversion factor, not affecting the calculation in J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses w in terms of cm^-1, but that's not the case here.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct photon momentum isn't among the options provided. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 N·s.

Wait, let me compute 1.1e-27 N·s.

E_photon = p c =1.1e-27 kg·m/s *3e8 m/s =3.3e-19 J.

Which is close to E_vib =2.65e-19 J. Hmm, perhaps there's a factor of ~1.23 difference (3.3/2.65≈1.23).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute E_rot.

E_rot = h²/(4 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * π^2 *1.2068e-46).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34^2 =4.39e-67.

Denominator:4 * (9.8696) *1.2068e-46 = 4.765e-45.

E_rot =4.39e-67 /4.765e-45 =9.21e-23 J.

Hmm.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 N·s.

But how to get there.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different model, such as the rigid rotor, where the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) h c B̃ ), and B̃ is in cm^-1. But earlier, B̃ came out to 2.32 cm^-1.

So E_J = 2 * h c * B̃.

h c = 12400 eV·Å (approx).

But in J, h c = 1.986e-25 J·m.

B̃=2.32 cm^-1 = 232 m^-1.

So E_J = 2 * 1.986e-25 J·m *232 m^-1 = 2 *1.986e-25 *232 = 2*4.62e-23 =9.24e-23 J.

Again, p=3.08e-31 N·s.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of the vibrational energy plus the rotational energy. But that would be E_photon = E_vib + E_rot = 2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 ≈2.65e-19 J.

p=8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, no option matches.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that either I made a mistake somewhere, or the correct option isn't listed. But since the options are given, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the transition to the next state, but to the next higher energy state which is the first state after the fundamental state. So it could be either (n=1, J=0) or (n=0, J=1). And among these, the lower energy transition is the rotational one.

But since the rotational transition has a photon momentum of 3.07e-31 N·s, which isn't listed, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.83e-28 N·s, which is close to option A) 1.9e-28 or D)1.4e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, like a typo in the bond length or mass. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the mass values.

Wait, the problem states:

Mx: mass of X =20 amu

My: mass of Y=2 amu

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using a different formula for the moment of inertia. For example, I = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) * R^2.

Yes, which is what I did.

Hmm.

Given all this, I'm forced to conclude that the correct answer based on my calculations isn't among the options. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 N·s, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy for J=0 to J=2.

E_rot for J=2 is (2*3)*h²/(8 π² I) =6 *9.2e-23 =5.52e-22 J.

p=5.52e-22 /3e8 =1.84e-30 N·s. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the first vibrational overtone, which would be n=2. But that would require E=2 h w, leading to p=1.77e-27 N·s, which is close to option A)1.9e-28. But not exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require E_rot=6 B.

Wait, B =9.2e-23 J for J=1. So for J=2, E_rot=6 *9.2e-23=5.52e-22 J.

p=5.52e-22 /3e8 =1.84e-30 N·s.

But again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be the sum of both vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would be way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the photon's momentum to be calculated using the angular frequency in a different way, such as p = h bar * something.

But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 N·s, but I can't see how to arrive at it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps B is calculated differently. Let me try another approach.

B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), which we calculated as 9.2e-23 J for J=1.

But perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, where the moment of inertia increases with rotational speed, but that's beyond the scope of the question.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions from J=0 to J=1, but using the bond length in a different unit, such as picometers.

Wait, R=2 angstroms is 200 picometers. Doesn't change anything.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula p = sqrt(2 m E), but that would be incorrect for photons.

Wait, photons don't have mass, so that formula doesn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the product of its momentum and the speed of light, E = p c.

Yes, which is what I've been using.

In conclusion, I think the correct approach leads to a photon momentum of 3.07e-31 N·s, which isn't among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't identify where. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 N·s, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is in its fundamental state (n=0, J=0). The task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:  
   The total energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:  
   \[
   E = E_{\text{vibrational}} + E_{\text{rotational}}
   \]  
   - Vibrational energy: \( E_n = (n + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \)  
   - Rotational energy: \( E_J = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) and \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

2. **Reduced Mass and Moment of Inertia**:  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \cdot 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]  
   Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is then:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.017 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2068 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Transition**:  
   The rotational constant \( B \) is:  
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.2068 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):  
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.2068 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   For the transition \( J=0 \to J=1 \), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = B \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \approx 1.84 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy difference for \( n=0 \to n=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Comparison of Energy Transitions**:  
   The rotational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 1.84 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J} \)) requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is \( J=1, n=0 \).

6. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
   \]  
   This value is far smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting a potential discrepancy in the problem setup or interpretation.

7. **Revisiting the Options**:  
   The closest option to the calculated vibrational transition momentum (\( p = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)) is **option D** (\( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)), though it is an order of magnitude smaller. Given the mismatch, the intended answer may be **option C** (\( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)), though the reasoning to reach this value is unclear.

**Answer: C**
