Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's think through this.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh wait, but it's relativistic, so classical mechanics might not apply directly.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² gives v_max squared as (kA²)/(m), so v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C, but this is a relativistic scenario, so I probably can't use that directly.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc², and the rest energy is mc². So the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and in the non-relativistic case, that's what's converted into kinetic. But when velocities get close to c, relativistic effects become significant.

Wait, but this is a harmonic oscillator, so perhaps the potential energy is the same as the classical case, but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So, at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at that point is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

But wait, wait. At maximum displacement, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so the velocity is zero. But wait, but when it's moving through equilibrium, velocity is maximum. So maybe the kinetic energy at x=0 is maximum. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem is asking for the maximum speed. So that's when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point (x=0). At that point, all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore.

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma mc². But E is also equal to the maximum kinetic energy, which occurs when the oscillator is at x=0.

Wait, but in the classical case, E is (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². So in this case, E would equal the potential energy at maximum amplitude. But in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

So E = (gamma) mc². The maximum kinetic energy would be E - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

But wait, the potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)k A². So E = (1/2)k A². So setting this equal to gamma mc².

Wait, no, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass and kinetic energy. So in the oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is equal to gamma mc². But when x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero (since velocity is zero). So, E = (1/2) k A² = gamma mc².

Wait, but no, because E in the relativistic case is the sum of kinetic and potential, but wait, that's only if the potential is treated classically. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)k x². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A², regardless of relativity.

So, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So then, E = (1/2)k A² = gamma mc².

But wait, in relativity, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if I can express gamma in terms of k, m, A, then I can solve for v.

So, gamma = (1/2)k A²/(m c²).

Wait, wait. Let's think again. E is equal to (1/2)k A², but E is also gamma m c². So:

gamma m c² = (1/2) k A².

So, gamma = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but this seems a bit off. Let's double-check.

Wait, no. Because the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But at x=0, the potential is zero, so E is kinetic. So E_kinetic = gamma mc² - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

But E is also (1/2)k A².

So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the speed at x=0, which is v_max.

So, let me write this equation again:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c^2.

gamma = (1/2 k A²)/(m c²) + 1.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)^2). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)^2) = (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1.

Wait, let's denote k A²/(2 m c²) as something. Let me compute:

Let me let term = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So,

gamma = term + 1.

gamma = 1 + term.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + term.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1 + term is greater than 1, so 1/sqrt(...) is greater than 1, which makes sense because v is approaching c.

Wait, but solving for v:

sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/(1 + term).

So,

1 - (v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 ].

Hmm, but I'm not sure this is leading me anywhere productive. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, using energy conservation. The total energy E is (1/2)k A², as that's the potential energy when x = A.

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the kinetic energy is E, which is (gamma -1) m c².

So,

E = (gamma - 1) m c²,

gamma = (E/(m c²)) + 1.

But E is (1/2) k A²,

So,

gamma = ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + 1.

Now, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [ (k A²) + 2 m c² ] / (2 m c² )

Wait, let me compute that:

gamma = ( (k A²) / (2 m c²) ) + 1.

Which is the same as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, another approach is to manipulate the equation to find v.

Let me write gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But that seems the same as before.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^2.

So,

(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Hmm. Let me compute this expression.

Alternatively, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

v^2 = c^2 [1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ]

But I'm not sure if this simplifies to any of the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, but that would have (something) squared in denominator. Hmm, that seems different from our expression.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²), which could be problematic if (k A²)/(2 m c²) is greater than 1, leading to a negative denominator. That might not be physical.

Option C: sqrt( k A²/m ), which is the non-relativistic case. So that's probably not the correct answer here since the question is relativistic.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, let me see. Our expression is:

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) ]

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) )

Wait, but that's not exactly matching any of the options. Let me check option D.

Option D says: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2m c²))^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + term )^2 )

where term is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Which matches exactly what we have for v. So that would correspond to option D.

Wait, let me confirm.

Our expression for v is:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1 / (1 + term )^2 ] )

Which is written as sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + term )^2 ), multiplied by c. Which is exactly option D.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

At x=0, all energy is kinetic. So, E = (gamma -1 ) mc².

Therefore:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1 ) m c².

So,

gamma = ( (1/2 k A² ) / (m c² ) ) + 1.

Which gives gamma in terms of k, m, A, and c.

Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as S.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + S.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + S)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + S)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + S)^2.

Which is what I did earlier.

Then,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + S)^2 )

Which is option D.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the energy conservation and relativistic mechanics.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Total Energy**: The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \), which is \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \).

2. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**: At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. The total energy is also expressed as \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor and \( v \) is the speed of the mass.

3. **Equating Energies**: Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

4. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**: Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we square both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
   \]
   Rearranging, we find:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Solving for \( v^2 \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**: Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
