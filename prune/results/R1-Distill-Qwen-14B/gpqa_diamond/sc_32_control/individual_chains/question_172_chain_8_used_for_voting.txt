Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

The question states that iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Oh wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the population ratio equals the exponential of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same number as the energy difference. Interesting.

So the ratio of excitation (n1/n2) is 2, right? Because star_1 has twice the excitation. So the ratio is 2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but since it's the same element (iron), the statistical weights g1 and g2 would be the same. So the equation simplifies to 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the excitation energy is the energy level difference. So if higher energy level is excited, then the formula is about the ratio of populations in the upper to lower states.

Wait, let me think again. The Boltzmann distribution formula is:

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But here, both stars have the same g factors since it's the same element. So the ratio becomes n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but wait, n1 is the population in the upper state, and n2 is the lower. Or wait, perhaps the question says that in star_1, the excited state is twice as populated as in star_2. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me read the question again.

Oh, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that means n1 (excited state) is twice n2 (ground state) for star_1. Wait, but maybe it's the ratio of excited to ground states. So for star_1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2. For star_2, it's (n_upper')/(n_lower') = 2 as well? No, wait, the problem says that in star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the ratio of the excited atoms is twice. So for example, maybe n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

So the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. So let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 R2, where R2 is star_2's ratio.

But each R is given by R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Wait, no, actually, the Boltzmann factor is the exponential of ( -ΔE )/(k T ), but wait, ΔE is the energy difference between the upper and lower levels. So if the upper level is higher by ΔE, then the exponent is negative. So the ratio R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) for each star.

Wait, but wait, ΔE is positive because it's the energy difference. So if the upper state is higher than the lower state, then the exponent is negative, so the ratio would be less than 1. But in the problem, star_1 has a higher ratio (twice), so R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. For each star, R = n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star_1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

The question says that R1 is twice R2. So:

R1 = 2 * R2

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, wait. Let me think again. No. Because R1 is the ratio for star_1, and R2 for star_2. The question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited (so the excited level is twice as populated?), but wait, wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because the Boltzmann factor says that the higher the temperature, the more the population in the higher energy levels. So if star_1 has more excitation (i.e., more atoms in the higher energy level), that would imply higher temperature than star_2.

Wait, but the question says that the ratio of excited atoms is twice. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I think that's correct. Now, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify the left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which is: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Now, rearranging terms:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Wait, but I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, where T is... wait, no, wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is also 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * (1 K). Because 1 K multiplied by 1.38e-23 J/K gives 1.38e-23 J.

So ΔE = k * (1 K) => ΔE / k = 1 K.

So substituting back, (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K

Wait, but the units here are a bit confusing. Let's see:

Wait, K is just a unit of temperature, but in the equation, (T1 - T2) is in Kelvin, and T1 T2 is K², so (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is 1/K, which when multiplied by K (from ΔE/k=1 K) gives a unitless quantity, which is correct because ln(2) is unitless.

Wait, but in the equation, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1 K) / ( (ΔE/(k)) )

Wait, perhaps I made a substitution mistake. Let me re-express:

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * K ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the equation again:

[ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2) * (ΔE)/(k) * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed without substituting ΔE/k as 1 K.

Wait, so the equation after substitution was:

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k = 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/k = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) K = 1 K.

So substituting:

1 K * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K * K? Wait, no, the left side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which has units of 1/K.

Wait, but the equation is:

1 K * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

So rearranging:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K ) * something?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on units. Let's think about the equation without units. The equation is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/k)

Wait, but ΔE/k = 1 K, so it's 1 K.

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * (1 K )

Wait, no. Let me think without units.

We have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (ln 2) * (ΔE)/(k)

But ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k =1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) J/(J/K) ) = K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln 2) * (1 K) / (1 K ) )

Wait, no, wait, the left side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), and the right side is (ln 2) * (ΔE / k) ) ?

Wait, no, the equation we derived earlier was:

(ΔE/k) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE )

Ah, because we can divide both sides by (ΔE/k):

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) * (k/ΔE )

But since ΔE = k * 1 K, then k/ΔE = 1/(1 K) ) * K.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

We have:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/k)

But ΔE = k * (something). Let's compute (ΔE/k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, k=1.38e-23 J/K → ΔE/k = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) K = 1 K.

So, ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * 1 K.

Wait, but the right side would have units of K*(something in 1/K) ), which would be unitless. But ln(2) is unitless, so that's okay.

Wait, but K * (something in 1/K) would be unitless, right.

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Wait, that's not correct, because the equation is:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/k)

But since ΔE/k is 1 K, then ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * 1 K.

Wait, but that would imply that the left side is unitless, and the right side has units of (K * 1/K) ) = unitless. So that's okay.

Wait, no, wait: the equation is:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (1 K)

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) * 1 K.

But that can't be, because the left side is unitless, and the right side would have units (K) * (1/K) ) = unitless. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, no, the right side would be (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) has units of 1/K, multiplied by 1 K, gives 1.

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) * 1 K * (1 K)^-1 ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but the key point is that the equation ends up as ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

So, looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, but wait, let me check my steps again.

Starting from R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln of both sides,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Bring ΔE/(k T2) to the left,

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2 )

Factor out ΔE/(k),

ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Which is,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2 )

Since ΔE/(k) = 1 K,

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / K * K ?

Wait, no, because (1 K) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / K

But wait, that's not correct because K would be in the denominator, but the units don't add up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when substituting ΔE/k.

Wait, let me write the equation again:

ΔE/(k) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE/(k) is (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

So,

1 K * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / 1 K

But that would give units of (K * 1/K) ) = 1, which is correct.

So,

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, because when I have 1 K multiplied by (something in 1/K ), I get a unitless quantity on the right.

Wait, 1 K * (1/K) ) = 1, which matches the ln(2) being unitless.

So,

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Which is exactly option D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Boltzmann Distribution**: The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
   \]

   For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

   \[
   R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
   \]

   The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

   \[
   R_1 = 2 R_2
   \]

2. **Substituting Ratios**: Substituting the expressions for \(R_1\) and \(R_2\):

   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
   \]

   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

   \[
   -\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
   \]

3. **Rearranging Terms**: Rearranging to isolate terms involving \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2)
   \]

   Factor out \(\Delta E / k\):

   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
   \]

   Simplify the term in parentheses:

   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
   \]

4. **Simplifying Further**: The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 1 \, \text{K}
   \]

   Substituting this into the equation:

   \[
   \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
   \]

5. **Matching the Options**: This matches option D, which states:

   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
   \]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
