Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, wave functions usually should be normalizable, right? And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, but in the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't look like it's zero between 1 and 3. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the wave function is actually given in a specific form. Oh wait, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something else? Or is it (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i? The way it's written, it's two terms. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a complex wave function. The square root is for real numbers, and "i" is the imaginary unit. So the wave function is a complex function.

But I'm a bit confused. To find the value of 'a', we probably need to normalize the wave function. Because wave functions must satisfy the normalization condition, where the integral of |ψ|^2 dx over all space equals 1.

So the first step is to normalize the wave function. Let's write down ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i.

Wait, that doesn't look right. Normally, wave functions are given as real functions, or complex exponentials. But this seems to be a combination of a real term and an imaginary constant term. Hmm, maybe I misinterpret the expression. Perhaps ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-0.5i}, but that would be a phase factor. Alternatively, the expression is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i — perhaps that's a complex expression where the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5? But that would make the wave function a complex function with a real part that depends on x and an imaginary part that's constant.

Wait, but then ψ(x) would be a function where the real part varies with x, and the imaginary part is a constant. That's possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but that's just a hypothesis.

Wait, the way it's written is: ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i. So that's ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i.

So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

But that would mean that ψ(x) is a complex function where the real part depends on x, and the imaginary part is a constant. But that seems unusual. Typically, both real and imaginary parts vary with x. But okay, maybe that's the case here.

The next part of the problem says that when we measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, but the given wave function isn't zero outside x=1 to x=3. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because that's consistent with the measurements.

Wait, but the given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. How does this fit into that? Because if ψ(x) is zero outside x=1 to x=3, then maybe the expression is only valid in that interval. So the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3, and (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i inside. Wait, but that would mean that the wave function isn't continuous. Or perhaps it's a piecewise function: ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i for 1<=x<=3, and zero otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is only defined in this region, so when x is outside 1 to 3, the wave function is zero. But given that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in 1<=x<=3, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, that complicates the normalization because the wave function is not zero in that interval. Alternatively, perhaps the given expression is the real part, and the imaginary part is zero? Hmm, the problem statement says "the wave function... can be described as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i." So the wave function is a complex function.

But given that, the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the first step is to normalize ψ(x) between x=1 and x=3.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx equals 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|^2. Since ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i, the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

Because for a complex number A + Bi, |A + Bi|^2 = A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that's correct? Let me double-check. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), so square is (a²)/(1+x). The imaginary part is -0.5, so square is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So their sum is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

So let's write that as:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split the integral into two parts:

a² * ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 * ∫1 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let's compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral is ln(2).

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to 3 is (3 - 1) = 2.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify the terms:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute the numerical value.

We know that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Take the square root to find a:

a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to 0.8485. So option B is the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, in the wave function, is the imaginary part -0.5i, which contributes 0.25 to |ψ|², yes. The integral from 1 to 3, correct. So the setup seems right.

Another point: The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So it's a sum of a term varying with x and a constant imaginary term. That is, the wave function is a complex function where the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we square the modulus, it's the sum of squares of real and imaginary parts, which is correct.

So the calculation seems correct, and the value of a is approximately 0.8485, which rounds to 0.85. So the answer is B.

To solve the problem, we need to normalize the given wave function. The wave function is provided as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

This is a complex function where the real part is \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\) and the imaginary part is \(-0.5\). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over all space equals 1. Since the wave function is non-zero only between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), we integrate over this interval.

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

We split the integral into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx\)
2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

### First Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx = a^2 \ln|1 + x| \Big|_1^3 = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining the results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtract \(0.5\) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solve for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest value to \(0.8485\) among the options is \(0.85\). Therefore, the value of \(a\) is:

**Answer: B**
