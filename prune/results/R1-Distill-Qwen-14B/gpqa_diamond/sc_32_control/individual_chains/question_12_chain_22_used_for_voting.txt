Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino. Oh wait, the neutrino is a neutrino, which is a neutral lepton, so it doesn't carry charge. But importantly, the pion is at rest before the decay.

The rest masses are given: the pion (Pi+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon (mu+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's mass is usually considered negligible in these problems, so I can probably ignore it. That's probably a big hint because it simplifies the calculations.

So the question is about the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A to D, with two values each. I think the first value is the kinetic energy of the muon, and the second is the neutrino's KE, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe both are the muon's? Wait, no, because the neutrino is a different particle. So each option lists the KE of mu and the KE of neutrino.

Wait, but the problem statement says "Find KE of product particles in," which suggests that there are two particles produced: mu+ and neutrino. So each product has its own kinetic energy.

Now, let's think about energy and momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

Hmm, but since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c (but since we're working in MeV and MeV/c units, the c might be normalized). Wait, more accurately, for a massless particle like a neutrino, its energy E is equal to |p|c. But in particle physics, energies are often given in MeV, and masses in MeV/c², so when calculating, the units have to line up.

So let's set up the conservation equations.

First, conservation of energy: the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy.

The muon's energy is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

The neutrino's energy is just its momentum times c, since it's massless: E_nu = p_nu c.

So the energy conservation equation is:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (p_nu c)

But also, from momentum conservation, the momenta must cancel. So:

p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude, opposite direction)

But the muon's momentum can be found from its energy and mass. The energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). So:

E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² c² + m_mu² c^4 )

But since p_mu = p_nu, and E_nu = p_nu c, substituting p_nu into the equation.

So substituting p_mu = E_nu / c into the muon's energy equation:

E_mu = sqrt( (E_nu^2 / c²) * c² + m_mu² c^4 )
= sqrt( E_nu^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 )

So the energy conservation equation becomes:

m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
= sqrt( E_nu^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) + E_nu

Let me write this without the c's, because everything is in MeV units. Let me make the substitution where c = 1, so E is in MeV, m is in MeV/c² * c² → MeV. Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to not get confused here.

Wait, let me think again. Let me denote m_pi as the rest mass of the pion, m_mu as the muon's rest mass. Both are given in MeV.

The equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (m_mu)^2 ) + E_nu

So m_pi = sqrt( E_nu² + m_mu² ) + E_nu

Let me let x = E_nu. Then the equation is:

m_pi = sqrt( x² + m_mu² ) + x

I can rearrange this:

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = m_pi - x

Then square both sides:

x² + m_mu² = (m_pi - x)^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x + x²

The x² terms on both sides cancel out.

So we get:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x

Rearranging for x:

2 m_pi x = m_pi² - m_mu²

So x = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Once I compute x, which is E_nu, the neutrino's energy, then the muon's energy is E_mu = m_pi - x.

Wait no, because the original equation was m_pi = E_mu + E_nu, so E_mu = m_pi - E_nu.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. So the muon's KE is E_mu - m_mu = (m_pi - E_nu) - m_mu.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute E_mu first.

So let's plug in the numbers:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV

Compute x = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2 * 139.6 )

Wait, let me compute numerator first: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Hmm, that's a difference of squares: (a^2 - b^2) = (a -b)(a +b).

So (139.6 - 105.7) = 33.9, (139.6 + 105.7) = 245.3.

So numerator = 33.9 * 245.3 ≈ let's compute that.

33.9 * 245.3: Let's approximate.

33.9 * 200 = 6780

33.9 * 45 = approx 1525.5

33.9 * 0.3≈10.17

Adding up: 6780 + 1525.5 = 8305.5 + 10.17 → 8315.67?

Wait, but let me think, 245.3 is 245 and 0.3.

Wait, 33.9 * 245.3 = 33.9*(245 + 0.3) = 33.9*245 + 33.9*0.3.

Compute 33.9*245:

Well, 33 * 245 = 8115, 0.9 *245=220.5 → 8115 +220.5 =8335.5.

33.9 * 0.3 = 10.17.

So total is 8335.5 +10.17 = 8345.67.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2 individually.

But perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I'm doing this manually:

139.6^2:

139.6 * 139.6.

I can compute 140 *140 = 19600, but subtract 0.4 * (2*140 - 0.4), but perhaps that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*(140)(0.4) + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2.

105.7 is 100 +5.7.

So (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi squared is 19488.16 MeV², m_mu squared is 11172.49 MeV².

So numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 *139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

What's 279.2 * 29.8 = approx? Let me see:

279.2 *30 = 8376, which is higher than 8315. So maybe 29.8 is too high.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

Difference between 8315.67 -8096.8= 218.87.

Now, 279.2 *0.8 = approx 223.36.

So 29.8 *279.2= approx 29*279.2 + 0.8*279.2= 8096.8 + 223.36= 8320.16.

Which is very close to 8315.67. So our x is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait: 279.2 *29.8 = 8320.16, but our numerator is 8315.67.

So 29.8 would give us 8320.16, which is 4.49 more than the numerator. So perhaps x is about 29.8 - (4.49)/279.2.

Wait, 4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So x ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 = 29.784 MeV. Approximately 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because m_pi is 139.6, so 2 m_pi is 279.2. So x is 8315.67 /279.2 → let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 → minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

So 279.2 *29=8096.8.

Now, 8096.8 is less than 8315.67 by (8315.67 -8096.8) =218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 = approx 0.782.

So x = 29 + 0.782 =29.782 MeV.

So approximately 29.78 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is about 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but that's the neutrino's total energy, which equals its momentum times c. So p_nu = E_nu / c. But since in these units, perhaps c is 1, so p_nu = E_nu.

Now, the muon's energy E_mu is m_pi - E_nu =139.6 -29.78 ≈109.82 MeV.

The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu =109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV, which is nearly 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's option D.

Wait, but let's check the calculation again for any possible mistakes.

Wait, the neutrino's KE would be its total energy because it's massless. So yeah, the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

The muon's KE is 4.12 MeV.

So the correct option is D, which lists 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me just double-check the calculation steps.

Another way to compute x is:

x = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / (2 m_pi )

m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Compute m_pi squared: 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 =140^2 -2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 =19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16.

m_mu squared:105.7^2= (100 +5.7)^2=100^2 +2*100*5.7 +5.7^2=10000 +1140 +32.49=11172.49.

Difference:19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

Divide by (2 *139.6)=279.2.

8315.67 / 279.2 = let me compute this accurately.

279.2 *29=279.2 *30 =8376 → minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

So 279.2 *29=8096.8.

Subtract from 8315.67: 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

Now, 218.87 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So 29 + 0.782=29.782 → about 29.78 MeV.

So E_nu =29.78 MeV.

E_mu =139.6 -29.78=109.82 MeV.

Muon's KE:109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV.

Yes, that's correct.

So the KEs are 4.12 MeV (muon) and 29.78 MeV (neutrino), matching option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is assumed to be massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\(E_{\mu^+}\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_\nu\)):  
   \[
   m_{\pi^+} c^2 = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]  
   The muon's total energy is related to its rest energy and kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}.
   \]  
   Substituting, we get:  
   \[
   m_{\pi^+} c^2 = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. Thus, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]  
   For the muon, its momentum is related to its total energy and rest mass:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{E_{\mu^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}.
   \]  
   For the neutrino, since it is massless, its energy equals its momentum:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu.
   \]  
   Substituting \(p_{\mu^+} = E_\nu\) into the momentum equation:  
   \[
   E_\nu = \sqrt{E_{\mu^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}.
   \]

### Solving for \(E_\nu\) and \(K_{\mu^+}\)
From energy conservation:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 - E_\nu.
\]  
Substituting this into the momentum equation:  
\[
E_\nu = \sqrt{(m_{\pi^+} c^2 - E_\nu)^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}.
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
E_\nu^2 = (m_{\pi^+} c^2 - E_\nu)^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4.
\]  
Expanding and solving for \(E_\nu\):  
\[
E_\nu = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}{2 m_{\pi^+} c^2}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
E_\nu = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \times 139.6}.
\]  
Calculating:  
\[
E_\nu = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's total energy is:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 - E_\nu = 139.6 - 29.78 \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino's energy is \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
