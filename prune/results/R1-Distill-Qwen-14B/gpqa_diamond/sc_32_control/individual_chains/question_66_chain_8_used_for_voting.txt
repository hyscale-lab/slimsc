Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, first, I should remember what SMEFT is. SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they parameterize the effects of new physics beyond the Standard Model. But when it comes to symmetries, the SMEFT must respect certain ones.

I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is built as an extension. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So that would mean option 1 is correct.

Then there's Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time uniformly). Since the Standard Model and SMEFT are both relativistic, they should respect Poincare. So operators must respect that too. So option 2 is correct as well.

CP symmetry is next. Wait, I remember that CP symmetry isn't necessarily respected by all operators. Because the SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP. For example, in the Standard Model, certain processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix are present. So in SMEFT, operators can include terms that break CP. So not all operators respect CP symmetry, meaning option 3 might not be correct. So 3 is not a must.

Then CPT symmetry. I thought that CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially those that are Lorentz invariant. Because CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. If a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together, which symmetries must be respected by all operators? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait—Poincare symmetry is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So the operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So, the question is, are all operators required to respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or just Poincare?

Because Poincare includes Lorentz, I think the correct way is that they must respect Poincare, so they would automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is which of the four options must be respected. So if the question is about which must be respected, perhaps both 1 and 2 are correct because the operators must adhere to them. But wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's also Lorentz-invariant. So in the SMEFT, when you write operators, you must ensure that they're Poincare-invariant, which implies they're Lorentz-invariant.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2, and 4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2. So which is correct?

Wait, the SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Because operators are built from SM fields in a way that they form Lorentz scalars. So they must respect Lorentz symmetry. Similarly, Poincare includes translations, so operators must also be invariant under spacetime translations. So both 1 and 2 are correct. Then 3 (CP) isn't necessarily always respected, but 4 (CPT) is, because CPT is a theorem in quantum field theories that are Lorentz invariant.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but are all operators respecting Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes not only Lorentz but also translations. So for any operator in SMEFT, it must be invariant under both Lorentz transformations and translations. So yes, both 1 and 2 must be respected.

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators parameterizing the effects of new physics. These operators must respect certain symmetries. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic theory, and all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This ensures that the theory is consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a relativistic theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry, which implies it also respects Lorentz symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model already allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of quantum field theories that are Lorentz-invariant. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).
