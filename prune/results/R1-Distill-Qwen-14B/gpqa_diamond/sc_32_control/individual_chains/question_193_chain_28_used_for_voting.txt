Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, okay. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is in arcseconds, and distance in parsecs. The formula I remember is distance = 1 / parallax. So plx = 1/d where d is distance in parsecs. So if parallax increases, distance decreases, and vice versa.

So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So substituting, 1/( (1/d) )^5 is equal to d^5. So 1/(plx^5) = d^5. Therefore, N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I think they're asking for the number of stars as a function of distance, like how many stars you find between r and r+dr, maybe? Or perhaps the differential number of stars with distance.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential distance. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be something like N dr proportional to d^5 dr. But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the number increases rapidly with distance, which might not make sense because in reality, the number of stars doesn't just keep increasing with distance without limit. But this is a specific scenario, so perhaps the math is different.

Wait, perhaps I should model this step by step. Let's define N as the number of stars. The statement says N varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d, so N ∝ d^5.

Wait a second, that's a huge increase. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power. But that seems counterintuitive. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because the number of stars you can observe beyond a certain distance might be limited by other factors, but in this problem, it's just a specific region, so perhaps the relation is given as N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant.

Now, the question is about how N changes with distance. So, the question is asking about the dependence on distance r. Since N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then (1/plx) is d. So N ∝ d^5. That is, N is proportional to r^5, where r is the distance.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the options given. The options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2. So option B is r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases very rapidly with distance.

Wait, but that seems odd because when you go further away, the density of stars in that direction would decrease, right? Or wait, maybe this is a specific region where the star density actually increases with distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the math.

If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx=1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as the fifth power. So looking at the options, option B is r^5.

But wait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars per unit volume, which is the number density. Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of stars in a given volume as a function of distance. Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps that's the number of stars per unit distance. So, if you have a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr, then the number of stars in that shell would be N dr proportional to r^5 dr. So the number per unit distance is N dr / dr = N, which is r^5. So the number per unit distance would be proportional to r^5. That would make the answer option B.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number per unit volume. But wait, the volume of a thin shell is 4π r² dr. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number density (N per unit volume) would be proportional to r^5/(r²) ) = r^3. But the question isn't about number density; it's about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So per unit distance, but does that account for the volume? Wait, perhaps the region is a specific volume, but the question is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me rephrase the question: the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. So if you have a larger distance, you have more stars as per that relation.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, which would be the number density. The number density is N divided by the volume. Volume is 4π r² dr for a thin shell. So number density n = N/(4π r² dr). But since N ∝ r^5, then n ∝ r^5/(r² dr) )= r^3/(dr). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as a differential. So for a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr, the volume is 4π r² dr. The number of stars in that shell would be N(r) dr, where N(r) is the number per unit distance. But wait, no, N(r) is the number in the shell, but how does that relate to the number per unit distance?

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to find how N changes with r. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So N = k d^5, where k is a constant. Then, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. So the answer would be option B, r^5.

But wait, let's think about the units. Parallax plx is in arcseconds. Since 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So plx (in arcseconds) = 1/d (in parsecs). So plx has units of 1/parsecs.

So 1/plx has units of parsecs. So 1/(plx)^5 is (parsecs)^5. So N has units proportional to (parsecs)^5, which would mean that N increases rapidly with distance. But that's counterintuitive because, in reality, the number of stars you can observe in a region decreases with distance because stars are not infinitely dense. But in this question, it's given that N varies as 1/plx^5, so we have to go with that.

So the conclusion is that N is proportional to r^5, which is option B.

The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can substitute \( \text{plx} \) in terms of \( d \). This gives \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5 \). Therefore, the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( d^5 \), or equivalently \( r^5 \), where \( r \) is the distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. This matches option B, which states \( \sim r^5 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
