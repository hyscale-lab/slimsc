Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum, excluding any exchanging protons.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane structure.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base. I'm thinking elimination reaction here. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, with excess KOH, maybe it's more of an elimination to form a double bond. So, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons? Well, in adamantane, positions 1 and 3 are adjacent in a way that they are on adjacent rings, but I might need to recall the structure.

Wait, adamantane's structure: It's a diamond cubic structure, a series of connected cyclohexane rings. So, 1 and 3 positions are two carbons that are across from each other? Or are they on adjacent rings? I think that 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the Br atoms on the same face, perhaps leading to a cis diene when elimination occurs.

Wait, when KOH is used with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it can cause elimination to form alkenes. But in this case, are the Brs on adjacent carbons? Because 1 and 3 positions in adamantane aren't adjacent. Oh wait, no. The adamantane structure is such that each carbon is connected in a way that each is part of multiple rings. The positions 1 and 3 are actually on opposite faces. Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together, right? So, perhaps 1 and 3 are across each other.

But wait, for elimination, the Br atoms need to be on adjacent carbons. If they're not, maybe the reaction would proceed differently. Hmm. Maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons where the Br atoms were. But if they are not adjacent, that might not be possible. Wait, maybe the KOH is causing two elimination steps. Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH to form an epoxide? No, wait, that's more for dihalides on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation to form an allene or something else.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. So, product 1 is a ketone.

Looking at the 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me think about what this could be.

A ketone would have a carbonyl. The NMR peaks: 4.79 ppm is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe a carbonyl. 10H in the 2.4-2.2 region could be part of a ring structure, perhaps multiple CH groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another CH2.

Wait, could product 1 be a diketone? Or perhaps a mono-ketone with a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming a double bond. But wait, the IR peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone.

Wait, maybe each Br is on an adamantane carbon. When KOH is added, each Br undergoes elimination, perhaps via an E2 mechanism, removing H and Br. But since both Br are present, maybe two E2 reactions happen, forming a diene or maybe a carbonyl.

Wait, but having two eliminations would lead to a conjugated diene if adjacent, but given the structure, perhaps they form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Elimination would form a carbonyl group. Oh! Because in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are known to undergo certain reactions. When a bridgehead hydrogen is abstracted and the halogen leaves, the adjacent carbons could form a double bond or maybe a carbonyl.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a bridgehead. So, when KOH is added, each bridgehead Br could undergo elimination, leading to the formation of two carbonyl groups. But that would be 1,3-diketone. Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, forming a double bond between the two bridgeheads.

Wait, but how would that form a ketone? If elimination occurs, we might form a double bond, but if it's a bridgehead H elimination, perhaps a bridgehead double bond, but that's not very common because bridgehead double bonds are strained. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons, but that's not the case for 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. In a ketone, the carbonyl would not have protons, but the adjacent protons could be in a certain environment.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows 4.79 (2H): maybe that's an AB system, such as two equivalent protons adjacent to a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated, perhaps it forms a conjugated diene. But the IR peak is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone, perhaps a bicyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but the product is a single ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe each Br is on a different carbon, and upon elimination, they form a single carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it could deprotonate a beta hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and forming a double bond. But if the two Br atoms are on the same carbon, that's a dibromide, but 1,3 dibromide would have each Br on a different carbon.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a different carbon, but in a way that allows for elimination. So perhaps each Br is on a position that allows elimination when KOH is present.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. If each bridgehead has a Br, when KOH is added, each could eliminate HBr, perhaps forming a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not common because of the strain. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond. But with two Br, perhaps dielimination would form a conjugated diene.

But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, maybe each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, leading to the formation of two carbonyl groups. But that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to another Br, which they are in 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β hydrogen, and each Br leaves, forming a double bond. Wait, no, elimination of two X's would require adjacent H and X on each, but for two X's, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation where two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming a diene. But if the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C, which is usually around 1600 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more for a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I should think of another approach. Let's consider the structure of product 1. The 1H NMR has 4.79 (2H). That's a singlet perhaps, or a multiplet. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests multiple CH groups in a rigid structure. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone. So, two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 3 of adamantane. But wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure. If each bridgehead has a ketone group, that might be possible.

Wait, the NMR for 1,3-diketone would have the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls. Let me think: in cyclohexane derivatives, the protons adjacent to carbonyl groups are usually deshielded. So, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for two protons adjacent to a carbonyl group.

But wait, for a diketone, the adjacent protons would be on both sides. Maybe in the structure, like a diepoxy or something else.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and think about the next steps, then come back.

Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide in excess, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. Could it be undergoing some kind of acylation?

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that product 1 is a diol, but I don't think so because of the IR peak. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that would show an IR peak around 1250 cm-1.

Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(isopropoxide)3, it might undergo some kind of rearrangement or perhaps undergo an enol ether formation or something else.

Wait, another thought: KOH might have caused a ring-opening of adamantane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but again, the IR doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the product is a diene. Let me think about IR: a peak around 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so I think it's not a diene.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. It has four cyclohexane rings, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on adjacent bridgeheads. When KOH is added, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, causing each Br to leave, and form a double bond between the two bridgehead carbons. But bridgehead double bonds are not stable. So perhaps instead, each elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, but if each Br is on a bridgehead, maybe elimination would form a carbonyl. So, two bridgehead carbons each losing Br and H to form a carbonyl.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of enolate formation or Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but adamantane is fully hydrogenated, so if product 1 is a diketone, perhaps the next step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But adamantane itself is a polycyclic structure and might not have aromatic rings to undergo Friedel-Crafts. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diene. Let's say 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon heating with KOH undergoes two dehydrohalogenation steps to form a conjugated diene. The IR would then show C=C peaks, but the given IR is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with KOH, substitution would be unlikely unless in a polar aprotic solvent, but KOH is more about elimination in such cases.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would give a diol. The IR of a diol would have O-H stretches, but the given IR is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl.

So, perhaps I'm stuck on product 1. Let me think about what other data is given. The 1H NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a singlet or a doublet. The 10H between 2.41 and 2.23 ppm suggests that these are equivalent or in a symmetrical environment. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with substituents. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, could product 1 be a cyclohexane derivative with a ketone group and other substituents? Like a bridged ketone.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the overall process. The initial reaction forms a ketone, which then reacts with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolysed to form product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically cleaves it into carbonyl compounds. So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two or more carbonyl groups.

Wait, but let's think step by step.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1, which is a ketone).

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps a mono-ketone. Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. AlCl3 is a common Lewis acid for Friedel-Crafts, but Al isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is also used. Since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, it could undergo ring-opening or some addition. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and Al isopropoxide induces some ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bridged ketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, it could form an enolate, which could undergo some reaction, perhaps forming a more substituted double bond.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a carbonyl that reacts with Al isopropoxide in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But without an aromatic ring, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: product 1 could be an epoxide, but I thought the IR didn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but again, the IR doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH forms a conjugated diene. Then, the diene could react with Al isopropoxide, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms a cyclohexenone. Let's say product 1 is cyclohexenone. Then, product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide could undergo some reaction.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is a diene formed by some kind of dehydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some elimination, so product 2 is a diene. Then, when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, it would break into carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozone cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. The position and number of carbonyls would depend on the structure of product 2.

But I'm getting stuck on the initial steps. Let me try to think of product 3. The question is about the NMR of product 3. It asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, not including those exchanging with D2O.

So, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or has conjugated carbonyl groups. The most deshielded protons would be near electronegative groups, like carbonyls.

In ketones, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are typically deshielded and split into specific coupling patterns.

Wait, let me consider the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed to form product 3. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would give two carbonyls, perhaps ketones or aldehydes, depending on substitution.

But in this case, product 3's NMR is what's being asked. Let me consider the possible coupling patterns.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

In a di-substituted double bond, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. The protons next to carbonyl groups would be split based on their neighboring protons.

Wait, but product 3 comes from ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl compounds. So, perhaps product 3 has a structure like a diketone, or maybe two carbonyls with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling of the most deshielded hydrogen. If product 3 has a structure where a CH2 is next to a carbonyl, the protons on that CH2 would be deshielded and show coupling to adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a geminal diol, but that's unlikely because ozonolysis followed by workup with dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive workup) would form carbonyls, not diols.

Wait, when ozonolysis is done with dimethyl sulfide, it typically leads to the formation of carbonyl groups without over-oxidation. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

Wait, so product 2 must have a diene structure. Let me imagine product 2 as a diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls, but if it's a conjugated diene, the ozonolysis would likely form a single molecule with two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (ketone).

Second step: product 1 → product 2 (diene, perhaps) by reaction with Al isopropoxide.

Third step: ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3 (diketone or similar).

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, let's think about its structure. Suppose product 3 has two ketone groups and some CH2 groups. The most deshielded protons would be adjacent to the carbonyls.

In such a case, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have their protons split by neighboring groups.

In a structure like (CH2)n-CO, the CH2 protons would couple with any adjacent protons. For example, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, their protons would each be adjacent to two other sets of protons.

Wait, but in a molecule like O=C-R-CO, where R is a CH2 group, the protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Those protons would be deshielded and split by neighboring protons.

Wait, but the coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons and their splitting.

Suppose the CH2 is in between two carbonyls. Each CH2 proton would be adjacent to protons on either side, but if each side has one proton, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is adjacent to a CH group, leading to triplet splitting.

Wait, wait. Let's imagine product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each CH2 group's protons would be adjacent to the other CH2 group. Each proton on a CH2 would have two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet (n+1, where n=2). But that's a triplet if each side has two protons.

Wait, but each CH2 group has two protons. So, for the central CH2, each of its protons is next to two protons on the adjacent CH2 group. So each would split into a triplet. But given that the adjacent group is a CH2, each proton would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in reality, for two adjacent CH2 groups, each proton on the first CH2 would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, the splitting might be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to a CH group with two protons.

Hmm, perhaps the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So, each proton on the first CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group has more protons, the splitting could be more pronounced.

Wait, but let me think about the possible splitting. Suppose the CH2 is next to another CH2 group. Each proton on the first CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each would be a triplet.

But wait, if each proton on CH2-1 is coupled with two protons on CH2-2, then each would have a triplet. Because n = number of neighboring protons = 2, so splitting is triplet.

But wait, in reality, in such a scenario, each proton on CH2-1 is adjacent to two protons on CH2-2, leading to a triplet for each. However, the two protons on CH2-1 are equivalent, so their coupling might not be observed as separate peaks but as a singlet. Wait, no, because each proton on CH2-1 is next to two on CH2-2, but since all are equivalent, perhaps it's a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is between two CH groups. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each CH2's protons would be next to two others, leading to triplets.

But wait, in such a scenario, each CH2 group would have two protons. The splitting would be as follows: each proton on CH2-1 is split by the two on CH2-2, leading to a triplet. Similarly, each on CH2-2 is split by the two on CH2-1, but if they're in the middle, perhaps they are split by neighboring protons on either side.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is adjacent to a CH group that has two protons. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO. Then, each CH2 proton would be next to two on the adjacent CH(CH3). So, each would be a triplet.

But this is getting a bit too speculative.

Alternatively, maybe product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to a CH group with two protons. So, each of these protons would couple with the two on the CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, let's think about coupling constants. For a CH2 group next to a CH2 group, each proton on CH2-1 would couple with two on CH2-2. So, each would be a triplet. But if the CH2-2 is next to another group, say a CH with two protons, each proton on CH2-1 would also couple with those two, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but if a CH2 group is next to a CH group with two protons, each proton on the CH2 would couple with two on the CH, leading to a triplet for each. But since the CH2 and CH are adjacent, perhaps the splitting is more complicated.

Alternatively, the most deshielded protons could be on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a CH group next to a ketone. Then, each proton on the CH would couple with the two on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet for each.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH group next to a carbonyl, and that CH is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each proton on the CH would see the two protons on the CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but then each of the two protons on the CH would each couple with two on the CH2, leading to a triplet, but since the two are equivalent, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a conjugated diene, say between carbons 1 and 2, and 3 and 4. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls, but in a conjugated diene, the ozonolysis would likely form a single molecule with two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups.

Assuming product 3 is something like O=C-R-CO, where R is a small group. For example, if product 2 was 1,3-pentadiene, product 3 would be O=C-(CH2)2-CO, which is adipic dialdehyde, but that's not a ketone. Wait, if it's 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ozonolysis would give two ketones.

Wait, another example: if product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ozonolysis would give two ketone groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more complex diene, leading to a more complex product 3.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone like 1,4-diketone. So, the structure would be something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. The CH2 groups would each have two protons. The protons on the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded and would show coupling.

In this case, each CH2 group's protons would be adjacent to each other. Each proton on the central CH2 would be next to two protons (from the adjacent CH2). So, each would split into a triplet. But wait, the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons.

Wait, if the structure is O=C-(CH2)2-CO, then each CH2 group is next to another CH2 group. Each CH2's protons would couple with the two on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the two CH2 groups are equivalent, so their NMR would overlap. So, each of the two protons on each CH2 would be a triplet. So, the CH2 groups would appear as triplets.

But the question is about the most deshielded proton, which would be the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So, for each CH2, the protons would be split by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the splitting would be between neighboring groups. So, for a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, each proton on the first CH2 would be split by the two on the next CH2. So, each would be a triplet. So, the NMR would show a triplet for those protons.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, each proton would be next to two on each side. So, each proton would be adjacent to four protons (two on each side). But that's not possible unless the molecule is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO. Then, each CH2 proton would be next to two on the CH group. So, each would be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is next to another CH2, which is in turn next to another CH2, leading to each proton being split by two on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Imagine the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each of the middle CH2 groups would have neighboring CH2 groups on both sides. Each proton on the middle CH2 would be next to two on each side, but wait, that's four protons. So, each would be split into a quintet (n=4, so n+1=5). But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups. Each of its protons would be adjacent to two on each side. So, each would be split into a triplet from the left and a triplet from the right. But wait, that would result in a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but wait. Each proton on the central CH2 is next to two on the left CH2 and two on the right CH2. So, each would be split by four protons in total, leading to a quintet. But that's option D: pentet.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the central CH2 is next to two different groups.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the most deshielded protons are on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group. Each of these protons would see two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But looking back at the options, option A is triplet.

Wait, could the most deshielded protons be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a single proton? For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO. Then, each proton on the CH2 would be next to the CH, which has two protons. So, each would be a triplet.

In this case, the CH2's protons would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if product 3 has a structure where a CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, each of which has two protons, then each CH2's protons would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded protons would be on the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls, and their coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Thus, the answer would be option A: triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, followed by reactions with aluminum isopropoxide and ozonolysis. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the final product (product 3) based on its $^1$H NMR spectrum.

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, leading to the elimination of two equivalents of HBr. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm$^{-1}$, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This indicates that the product is a ketone. The $^1$H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a symmetrical structure with CH$_2$ groups adjacent to a carbonyl and other CH groups in a rigid framework.

### Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide
Product 1 (a ketone) reacts with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely induces further structural changes, potentially forming a diene (product 2). The exact mechanism is not explicitly detailed, but the formation of a diene is consistent with subsequent ozonolysis.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2
Ozonolysis of product 2 (a diene) cleaves the double bonds, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 is likely a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups. The most deshielded protons in product 3 would be adjacent to these carbonyl groups.

### Step 4: Coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3
The most deshielded protons in product 3 are adjacent to carbonyl groups. These protons are likely part of a CH$_2$ group flanked by other CH$_2$ groups. Each proton on the CH$_2$ group couples with the two protons on the adjacent CH$_2$ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

### Critical Analysis of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with the CH$_2$ group adjacent to a carbonyl, where each proton couples with two equivalent protons on the neighboring CH$_2$ group.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of protons, which is not supported by the structure.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would involve coupling with one proton and splitting by two equivalent protons, which is not consistent with the structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.

The most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

ANSWER: A
