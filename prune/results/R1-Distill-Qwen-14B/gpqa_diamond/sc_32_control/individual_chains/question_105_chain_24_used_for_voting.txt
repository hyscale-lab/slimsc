Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed, similar to an exoplanet. We need to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change as the spots.

First, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, I think, because it's a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spot temp is 5000 K? Or wait, no, the question says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. Oh, but wait, Teff of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The situation is that when we observe the star, because it's rotating, the spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations. But if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve?

So the key here is to find the relative change in brightness, or the signal amplitude, caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

I remember that the change in brightness (ΔF) when a planet transits a star is given by the area ratio. Since the planet blocks some light, the fractional decrease is (Rp / Rstar)^2. So that's the transit method for detecting exoplanets.

But in this case, the star's brightness is varying due to spots. So I need to calculate the variation caused by the spots and equate that to the variation caused by a planet transit.

Wait, but the spots are on the star's surface. When the star rotates, more or less of the spots are facing us. Since the spots are cooler, they contribute less light when they're facing us. So when a spot is on the hemisphere we're seeing, the total brightness decreases. But as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, leading to a periodic change in brightness.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. But the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, let me clarify. The star's surface is a sphere, so each hemisphere has a surface area of 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4 π R². Because the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR², so the spots cover 0.4 π R² over the entire star? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere that's spotty. So for the entire star, the spotty hemisphere has 20% spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4 π R². But the other hemisphere isn't spotty, so total spotty area is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots' lower brightness affects our observations. So the maximum effect (the minimum brightness) is when all the spots are facing us, and the brightness goes back to normal when the other hemisphere (non-spotty) faces us.

So the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) due to the spots would be the difference in flux when the spots are visible and when they're not.

First, the total flux from the star without any spots would be F0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4. Wait, no, the flux is the total power emitted, which is σ Teff^4 times surface area. So F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when spots are present, part of the surface is emitting less. The spots have a temperature of 5000 K, so each spot contributes σ (5000)^4 per unit area. The non-spotty areas are at 6000 K, so their contribution is σ (6000)^4 per unit area.

The fractional change in brightness can be calculated as the difference between the total flux when spots are visible and when they are not, divided by the original flux.

Let me compute the flux when the spots are visible. The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. The spotty hemisphere has 20% spots, so 80% is normal, and 20% is cooler.

So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

Flux_spotty = (0.8 * Area_spotty_hemisphere * σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * Area_spotty_hemisphere * σ (5000)^4 )

But wait, the spotty hemisphere has an area of 2π R². The filling factor is 0.2, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the non-spotty part of the spotty hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 )

The flux from the non-spotty hemisphere is:

F_non_spotty = 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4 )

So the total flux when the star is showing the spotty hemisphere is F_spotty + F_non_spotty.

Wait no, actually, when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the non-spotty hemisphere is on the other side, so we only see the spotty hemisphere. Wait, no, when a star is viewed from the side, we see one hemisphere. So in this scenario, the star is such that one hemisphere is spotty, the other is normal. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view and then the other.

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty_hemi = 0.2 * (2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + 0.8 * (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, wait, no. Because the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the spotty hemisphere is covered by spots. So 80% is normal. So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The other hemisphere isn't spotty, so when the spotty hemisphere is not facing us, the flux is (2π R² * σ (6000)^4 ) from the spotty hemisphere (but wait, if the other hemisphere is not spotty, when the spotty hemisphere is not visible, the flux is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 from the non-spotty hemisphere and the other 2π R² from the spotty hemisphere? No, that can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The star is a sphere. We're observing it from Earth, and as it rotates, we see different parts of its surface. The star has two hemispheres: one (let's say the front) is 20% spotted, the other (back) is completely normal.

When the front hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_front = (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4).

The back hemisphere, which isn't spotty, contributes F_back = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait no, but when the front is facing us, the back is on the other side and not visible. So the total flux we receive is just F_front when the front is facing us, and F_back when the front is not facing us.

Wait, no. Wait, when the front is facing us, the front hemisphere is the one we see, so the flux is F_front as I wrote. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the back hemisphere becomes the front, so the flux is F_back, which is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but that's only true if the back hemisphere is completely normal, which it is. So the flux variation is between F_front and F_back.

So the maximum flux is F_back = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

The minimum flux is F_front = 0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_back - F_front) / F_back.

Wait, no. Because F_back is the flux when the front is not spotty (so, when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher than when the spotty one is facing us).

Wait, no. Let me correct this. When the star is in a position where the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_front_spotty. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so the flux is F_back_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the maximum flux (F_max) is F_back_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

The minimum flux is F_front_spotty = [0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 ] + [0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4 ].

So the change in flux is (F_max - F_min) = F_back_non_spotty - F_front_spotty.

Which would be:

F_back_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_front_spotty = 2π R² [ 0.8 σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 σ (5000)^4 ].

So F_back - F_front = 2π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ) ].

Simplify that:

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

So the amplitude is the relative change, which is (F_back - F_front) / F_back.

Wait, but F_back is the maximum flux. The amplitude is the maximum dip, which is (F_back - F_front) / F_back.

Wait, no. The dip is F_back - F_front; but the relative dip is (F_back - F_front) / F_back. Because F_back is the maximum flux, and F_front is the minimum.

So the fractional change is ΔF = (F_back - F_front) / F_back.

Plugging in:

ΔF = [0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) * 2π R² σ ] / [2π R² σ (6000^4)]

Simplify:

ΔF = [0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (6000^4 )

Factor out 6000^4 from numerator and denominator:

= 0.2 [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So ΔF ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355% dip in brightness.

Wait, but wait, the question says the star's brightness variation is similar to that of an exoplanet. When a planet transits the star, the fractional dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

So the dip due to the planet is (Rp^2) / (Rstar^2).

We need to find Rp such that (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) equals the ΔF we just calculated, which is approximately 0.10355.

So (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So Rp ≈ 0.3218 Rstar.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → ~0.39

B) ~0.07 → about 7% of Rstar

C) ~0.11 → 11%

D) ~0.32 → 32%

So the closest option is D) ~0.32.

But wait, the problem states that the star's brightness variation is due to spots. But the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the exoplanet would cause. So the dip caused by the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.10355, which is approximately 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is close.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and equate it to the transit depth caused by the planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \)
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
   - One hemisphere is covered by dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The flux from the star without spots is \( F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The spotty hemisphere has 20% of its surface covered by spots, so:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4
     \]
   - The non-spotty hemisphere contributes:
     \[
     F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - The maximum flux (\( F_{\text{max}} \)) occurs when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum flux (\( F_{\text{min}} \)) occurs when the spotty hemisphere is visible:
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} = F_{\text{non-spotty}}, \quad F_{\text{min}} = F_{\text{spotty}}
     \]
   - The fractional change in brightness is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}}
     \]
     Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{max}} \) and \( F_{\text{min}} \):
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 - \left[ 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4 \right]}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \cdot \frac{(6000)^4 - (5000)^4}{(6000)^4}
     \]
     Compute \( (5000/6000)^4 \approx 0.48225 \), so:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 \approx 0.10355
     \]
     Thus, \( \Delta F \approx 0.10355 \) (or 10.355% dip in brightness).

3. **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:
   - The fractional brightness change caused by a planet transiting the star is given by:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, set \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
     Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The closest value to \( 0.3218 \) is \( 0.32 \), corresponding to option **D**.

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

**Answer: D**
