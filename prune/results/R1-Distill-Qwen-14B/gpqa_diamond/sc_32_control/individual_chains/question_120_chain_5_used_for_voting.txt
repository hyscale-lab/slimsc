Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to Earth's orbit, and it's inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. I think I need to model this. Let me visualize it. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their density is the same throughout space. So the number of stars depends on the volume of space.

Parallax (plx) is given by plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So d = 1/plx. Volume in three dimensions is proportional to d^3, right? So the volume between d and d+Δd would be about 4πd² Δd, if I'm using spherical shells. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. Let me think in terms of plx instead of distance. Let's express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then d^3 is (1/plx)^3, and d² would be (1/plx)^2.

So the number of stars per unit parallax would be the number per unit distance multiplied by the change in distance per change in parallax. Because plx = 1/d, so Δplx would be - (1/d²) Δd. So Δd = -d² Δplx. But wait, when plx increases (because d decreases), the number of stars per unit plx might depend on how the volume changes with plx.

Alternatively, since the number per unit distance is proportional to d² (because the volume element is 4πd² dd), but I'm not sure if that's right. Wait, when you have a volume element, it's 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to 4πd² dd. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d².

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I need to relate this to plx. Let's express it in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So d² is (1/plx)^2, and dd is the change in d. The change in plx, let's say Δplx, so Δd = - (1/plx²) Δplx. So the number of stars per unit plx would be (number per unit d) multiplied by the number of d units per plx unit.

Wait, so number per unit d is proportional to d². So number per unit plx would be number per unit d multiplied by (Δd per Δplx). So Δd is -(1/(plx)^2) Δplx. So the number of stars per unit plx (let's say N) would be N = (number per d) * (Δd / Δplx). But number per d is proportional to d².

Wait, number per unit d is proportional to d², so (number per d) = k * d², where k is some constant. But d = 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². So number per d is k/(plx)^2.

Now, the number per unit plx is (number per d) * (Δd/Δplx), because for a given Δplx, how many d's are we covering? Wait, no. Let me think. The number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + Δplx is the integral from d to d + Δd of (number per d) dd.

But since Δplx is small, I can approximate this. So ΔN = (number per d) * Δd.

But Δd = (Δplx) * (d^2). Because since plx = 1/d, d is 1/plx, so d^2 is 1/(plx)^2. So Δd = (d^2) * Δplx → (1/plx^2) Δplx.

So ΔN = (number per d) * (1/plx² Δplx).

But number per d is proportional to d² → which is (1/plx²). So number per d is k/(plx^2).

Putting it all together: ΔN = (k / plx^2) * (Δplx / plx²) → k * Δplx / plx^4.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. Wait: Number per unit d is n = k * d^2. So when plx increases by Δplx, the change in d is - (1/(d^2)) * Δplx. So Δd is - (plx²) Δplx because d = 1/plx; so 1/(d^2) is plx².

So the number of stars in that Δd is n * Δd = k d^2 * (-plx² Δplx) ) = k (1/plx²) * plx² * Δplx) → k * Δplx.

Wait, that can't be right because then the number per unit plx is constant, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully. Let's model the number of stars per unit distance. Let’s say the number of stars between distance d and d + dd is proportional to 4π d² dd. So the number per unit distance (number per dd) is proportional to d². 

Now, since parallax plx is 1/d, we can write d as 1/plx. So substituting, the number per unit distance is proportional to (1/plx)^2.

But we need the number per unit parallax, which is how many stars are in a slice of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. So, how does that translate?

The change in parallax dplx corresponds to a change in distance dd. Let's relate dd and dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dplx = - plx² dd.

The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is the same as the number of stars between d and d + dd, which is 4π d² dd. But dd is - (d²) dplx. So substituting, the number of stars is 4π d² * (-d² dplx) → which would be negative, but we can take absolute values.

So, the number of stars in a small range of dplx is 4π (d^2) * (d^2) dplx. But wait, that would be 4π d^4 dplx. Since d = 1/plx, d^4 = (1/plx)^4. So N = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but that would suggest the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the number per unit plx, N, is proportional to 1/(plx^4). Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the number per unit distance was proportional to d^2. So when you convert to plx, you have to account for how the width in plx relates to the width in d. So this seems to line up with option A. So the correct answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself. 

The volume element in spherical coordinates is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), meaning the number of stars per unit distance (\( dd \)) is proportional to \( d^2 \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the number of stars per unit distance becomes proportional to \( \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).

To find the number of stars per unit parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)), we relate \( dd \) to \( d\text{plx} \). From \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we have \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to:

\[
\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**.
