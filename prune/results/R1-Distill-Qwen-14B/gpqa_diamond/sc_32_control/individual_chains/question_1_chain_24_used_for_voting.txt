Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to determine which of the given options represents a suitable energy difference between E1 and E2 so that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its uncertainty in energy. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here, right? The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, if the states have different lifetimes, their uncertainties in energy will be different. But wait, the lifetimes given here are for each state. Does that mean each state's uncertainty in energy is inversely related to its lifetime?

So for E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 10^-9 seconds, the uncertainty in energy ΔE1 would be approximately ħ/(τ1). Similarly, for E2 with τ2 = 10^-8 seconds, ΔE2 is ħ/(τ2). But wait, are we talking about the same energy uncertainty here, or are we considering the difference between the two states?

Wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let's denote ΔE as |E2 - E1|. To clearly distinguish between the two states, this ΔE must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the uncertainty in their energy differences?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle tells us that the lifetime of a state is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in its energy. So a longer lifetime implies a smaller energy uncertainty. But when we're looking at the transition between two states, the energy difference's uncertainty might come into play.

Wait, maybe the energy difference's uncertainty is related to the lifetimes of both states. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, another approach. The energy difference must be such that when measured, it's possible to distinguish the two energy levels. The energy resolution required would depend on the time over which the energy is measured. But how does the lifetime of each state affect this?

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE between the two states is determined by the minimum of the two lifetimes, or maybe the sum. Hmm, I'm not too clear on that.

Wait, another thought: The uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE would be approximately ħ divided by the time it takes for the system to transition between the two states. But if the system has a certain lifetime for each state, perhaps the time resolution needed is related to the inverse of the energy difference. Because the energy difference would determine the transition frequency between the states.

Oh! The frequency (or energy) of a photon emitted during a transition between two states is given by E = ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The time it takes to observe the transition is related to the inverse of the frequency, Δt ≈ 1/ΔE. So, for the energy difference to be resolvable, the measurement time must be longer than the period of the transition frequency. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, more accurately, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time says ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty in energy when you have a time measurement of Δt is ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So, to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference must be at least on the order of the uncertainty. So, if the energy difference ΔE is small enough, it might not be distinguishable because the uncertainty is large.

Wait, but in this question, each state has its own lifetime. So maybe each state's energy has its own uncertainty. So ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The uncertainty in the energy of each state is inversely proportional to their own lifetimes. So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

So, to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference between them (ΔE = |E2 - E1|) must be significantly larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe larger than the individual uncertainties?

Alternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainties. So ΔE must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But wait, what's the exact condition for the energy difference to be resolvable? I think the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. So, what's the uncertainty in ΔE?

Hmm, not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is determined by the minimum of the two lifetimes? Or maybe the sum?

Wait, let's think more carefully. Each state has its own energy and uncertainty. The energy difference's uncertainty would be the sum of the uncertainties in each energy. So, ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, to have a clear distinction, the actual energy difference (ΔE) must be greater than ΔE_total.

So, let's compute the uncertainties. τ1 is 1e-9 s, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s ≈ 1.05e-25 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 6.56e-8 eV.

So ΔE_total is ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8) eV ≈ approx 7.216e-7 eV.

Wait but that's about 7e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 7e-7 eV to be clearly resolved?

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is smaller than 7e-7 → can't resolve.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller → no.

C) 1e-4 eV → larger than 7e-7 → yes.

D) 1e-8 → smaller than 7e-7 → no.

So the correct option would be C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So for τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J → converting to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 1.05e-25 J /1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J → 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

Summing them: 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = 7.216e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference must be larger than approximately 7e-7 eV for the two levels to be clearly distinguished. Looking at the options again, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, way larger than 7e-7 eV. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but another thought: Is the uncertainty in the energy difference the sum of the uncertainties? Or is there another way to model this? For instance, perhaps the energy difference is measured with a certain uncertainty, which depends on how the system is probed. If the system is in a superposition of the two states, maybe the lifetime is related to the time it takes for the state to decay, but I'm not entirely certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is influenced by the shorter of the two lifetimes, as the shorter lifetime (τ1) would give a larger uncertainty. Let me think. τ1 is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 is about 6.5e-7 eV. If τ2 is longer, its ΔE is smaller. So, the dominant uncertainty is the larger one, which is ΔE1. So, perhaps the minimum energy difference required is larger than ΔE1, which is 6.5e-7 eV. But option C is 1e-4, which is way larger.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the uncertainties in each energy. Because if E1 has an uncertainty of ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2, then the difference |E2 - E1| has an uncertainty of ΔE1 + ΔE2. That makes sense, because if E2 is uncertain by ΔE2 and E1 is uncertain by ΔE1, the difference is uncertain by their sum.

So, yes, the minimum required ΔE must be greater than that sum. So, the calculation I did earlier is correct, and option C is the only one that satisfies that.

So, the answer should be C) 10^-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, the lifetimes of the two states, \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), represent the uncertainties in time for each state. The uncertainties in energy for the two states are given by:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be significantly larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Examining the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it also cannot resolve the two states.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it can clearly resolve the two states.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**, as it satisfies the condition for clear resolution.
