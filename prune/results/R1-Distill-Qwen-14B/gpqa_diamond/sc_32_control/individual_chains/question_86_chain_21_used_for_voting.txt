Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The options give possible starting materials for A and B, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Hmm, I remember that the formation of a cyclic ketone like tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one usually comes from a ketone undergoing some kind of cyclization. Wait, perhaps these are examples of the pinacol rearrangement or maybe the Prins cyclization? Or could it be related to the Dieckmann condensation? Alternatively, maybe it's a case of ketone reduction involving borohydrides.

Wait, the products are both cyclic ketones. Let me think about their structures. The product is 4-ethyl... so there's an ethyl group at position 4. The ring is a six-membered ring, tetrahydropyran, so five carbons from the chain and one oxygen, but wait, no, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen (like a cyclic ether with five carbons and an oxygen). But the substituents are at position 2 and 4.

Wait, but the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The ring is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, so it's similar to a cyclic ether with a ketone.

I think this product comes from the reduction of some kind of carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, wait. The product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Or maybe it's a result of a reduction of a carbonyl group that's part of a larger structure.

Wait, the reducing agents used are LiBH4 and BH3. Both are borohydride reducing agents, but I think they have different selectivities. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters and ketones, while BH3 is typically used for ketones but not esters. Or wait, BH3 is used for ketones, and maybe in some cases for esters but under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe in this context, they're reacting with ketones.

Wait, but the products are cyclic ketones. So perhaps the starting materials were ketones that underwent some kind of cyclization upon reduction. Or maybe it's about the stereochemistry of the reduction.

Wait, another thought: The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the starting materials must have been such that when reduced, their configuration leads to the respective stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, so the reaction is a reduction. Let's think about the possible structures. Let's imagine that the starting material is a carbonyl group somewhere in a molecule, and when reduced, it forms an alcohol, and then perhaps undergoes cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. For example, an ester group which, when reduced, becomes an alcohol, then undergoes acid-catalyzed cyclization to form a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, the reduction could be of a ketone to form a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization.

Wait, looking at the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, perhaps it's formed through an acid-catalyzed cyclization of a diol or an alcohol. But the reducing agents are LiBH4 and BH3, which would typically reduce carbonyl groups (like ketones and aldehydes) to their respective alcohols.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the starting material could be an ester or a hemiacetal.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the structure of the product. The product is a six-membered ring, with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is like O connected to two carbons, making a five-membered ring? No, wait, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen. So positions 2 and 4 are adjacent in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various cyclizations. For example, under acidic conditions, they can undergo intramolecular aldol condensation. But in this case, the reduction is happening first.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester with a ketone in the same molecule. For example, something like a 5-oxo-pentanoate ester. Let me think: if you have a molecule with a ketone and an ester group separated by a certain number of carbons, perhaps upon reduction, the ester group is converted into an alcohol, which then can form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters of a ketone which, upon reduction, form diols or something that can cyclize.

Wait, wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. Oh, wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via an acid-catalyzed cyclization from a diol or another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the aldol reaction. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reagents.

In the first reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and then H+. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In the second reaction, B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The products are both the same ketone, but with different configurations. So both starting materials A and B are being reduced to form the same ketone, but in different enantiomeric forms.

Wait, that can't be right because the same product would have the same configuration if the starting material and reaction are the same. So perhaps the starting materials are different and when reduced, produce different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epimers. Hmm. No, perhaps the starting materials are ketones with different configurations. But after reduction, which would form alcohols, but then how does that lead to a different configuration in the product?

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters of a ketone. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone. The stereochemistry during the reduction would influence the configuration of the alcohol, which in turn affects the configuration of the ring when it cyclizes.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. Let's say the starting material is an ester with a structure like R-CO-O-R', where R is a chain that allows for cyclization upon reduction. When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester to an alcohol. The LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters. Alternatively, BH3 is typically used for ketones but not esters. Wait, but if the starting material is a ketone, then both LiBH4 and BH3 would reduce it to an alcohol.

Wait, maybe in reaction A, the starting material is a ketone, and in reaction B, it's another ketone with different stereochemistry, or perhaps it's an ester, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are hemiacetals or acetals. No, that doesn't fit with the reagents.

Let me think about the product structure again. The product is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The substituents are at positions 2 (ketone) and 4 (ethyl). So perhaps the starting material is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the reagents being reducing agents.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product is formed via the reduction of a cyclic ketone. But that doesn't make sense because the product is a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketones that, upon reduction, form alcohols, which then cyclize to form the ring.

Wait, let's imagine that the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like something with a structure like CH2CH2CO-O-R, and when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, leading to a structure that can cyclize into a ring.

Wait, let me think about the product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The ring is six-membered: O connected to C2 and C5 perhaps. So positions 2 (O), 3, 4, 5, 6, and back to O.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a pentanoate ester with a ketone group. Let's think: for example, a molecule like (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, the options are given as A and B, so looking at the options, all the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with R or S configuration.

So let's see: the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents at position 5. So position 5 has an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group. So the structure would be something like:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy) and a COOH group as well? Or wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, so perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me look at the options again. The starting materials are A and B, which are either (S) or (R) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2 ? No, wait, let me draw it.

The IUPAC name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the pentanoic acid has 5 carbons. The substituents are at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me number the chain:

1   2   3   4   5
COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CO-O-iBu ?

Wait, no. The structure would be:

Positions 1 to 5: 1 is the COOH group, then 2 is CH2, 3 is CH(Et), 4 is CO, and 5 is O-isobutoxy.

Wait, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

O
|| 
C(OH)-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy group) at position 5, and an ethyl group at position 3.

So when you have a 5-oxo group (ketone) and a 5-isobutoxy in the same position? That would make the structure:

The molecule is pentanoic acid with substituents at 3 and 5.

So structure: CH2CH2-C(O)-O-iBu at position 5, and an ethyl at position 3.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CO-O-iBu.

Wait, but that would be four carbons, not five. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu.

Wait, that's five carbons. So positions 1: COOH, 2: CH2, 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) (that's an ethyl group?), wait, no. Wait, the substituent at 3 is ethyl, so it's CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu.

So the carbon chain is:

1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH with ethyl group), 4 (CO), 5 (O-iBu).

So that's a pentanoic acid with a ketone at position 4 (since carbonyl is at 4) and an isobutoxy group at position 5.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at 3, 5. The substituents are ethyl at 3 and isobutoxy and oxo at 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

At position 3: an ethyl group, and at position 5: a ketone (oxo) and an isobutoxy group. But wait, that would require the same carbon to have two substituents, which isn't possible unless it's a geminal di-substitution, which isn't feasible for a ketone and an ether. Hmm, maybe I've got the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the pentanoic acid chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CO-O-iBu.

Wait, that's four carbons, but pentanoic acid has five. So I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

But perhaps I don't need to get too bogged down in the structure. Let's think about the reaction.

The starting material is treated with a reducing agent. For reaction A, LiBH4 and H+ are used, giving (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction B uses BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

So the starting materials are both esters or ketones that get reduced to form alcohols, which then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but wait: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. LiBH4 can reduce esters, while BH3 typically doesn't. So if reaction A uses LiBH4, maybe the starting material is an ester, which LiBH4 reduces to an alcohol. Then, under acidic conditions, the alcohol could cyclize to form the cyclic ketone. Similarly, reaction B uses BH3, which is a weaker reducing agent. If the starting material for B is a ketone, then BH3 would reduce it to an alcohol, which then cyclizes.

Hmm, but if the starting materials are different (one is an ester, the other is a ketone), then their reductions would produce different structures. But the options suggest that A and B are both 3-ethyl...oxopentanoic acids, which are likely to be esters or perhaps the acid itself.

Wait, wait, the starting materials are listed as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, etc. So the starting materials are carboxylic acids with substituents.

Wait, but LiBH4 can't reduce carboxylic acids. They need to be converted to their salts first, but in general, LiBH4 doesn't reduce carboxylic acids. So perhaps the starting materials are esters, not acids. Wait, the options say they are pentanoic acids, but perhaps in the reaction, they are in an ester form.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters.

Wait, a gamma-keto ester would have the structure RCOCH2COOR', which upon reduction would form RCH2CH2COOR'. Wait, but no, LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, giving RCH2CHOHCOOR'?

Hmm, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ketone with an ester group, which upon reduction forms an alcohol that can cyclize into a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a ketone group that's in the same molecule. For example, the ester is at one end, and the ketone is a few carbons away. When the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, it can attack the ester to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. So, for example, the structure would be CH2-CO-O-R, and when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, leading to a structure that can form a ring.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When LiBH4 reduces it, the ketone becomes an alcohol. Then, under acidic conditions, the ester could undergo intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution, where the alcohol attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to ring formation.

So the gamma-keto ester would have four carbons between the ester and the ketone. Wait, perhaps in this case, the starting material is 5-oxo-pentanoate ester (if the chain is longer).

Wait, but let's think about the product. The product is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. So the ring would require the starting material to have the appropriate chain length for cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a 5-oxo-pentanoate ester: CH2CH2COO-R, but that might not cyclize properly.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has the ester and the ketone separated by two carbons, allowing a five-membered ring formation. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction forms the product, but that doesn't fit with the reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the reaction. The product has R and S configurations, which suggests that the reduction step leads to the formation of a stereocenter.

Wait, when a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's approach. But wait, ketones are planar, so the reduction would proceed with some stereochemistry.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both used for ketone reductions. However, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters as well, but BH3 typically doesn't. So if reaction A uses LiBH4, the starting material might be an ester, or a ketone. Reaction B uses BH3, which suggests a ketone.

Wait, but the starting materials are given as pentanoic acid derivatives, which are likely esters or acids. Since LiBH4 can reduce esters, and BH3 can't, perhaps A is an ester and B is a ketone.

But the starting materials are given as pentanoic acids with substituents. So perhaps they're in ester form in the reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the product's configuration.

The product is (R) or (S). When the starting material is reduced, the configuration at the new stereocenter is determined by the starting material and the reduction.

In ketone reductions, the borohydride approaches from the less hindered side. The stereochemistry is determined by the hydride attack. Wait, no, in ketone reductions, the hydride can attack from either side because the carbonyl is planar. So the reduction of a prochiral ketone would form a racemic mixture, but if the starting material is chiral, the product would have a certain configuration. Or perhaps the starting material's configuration influences the product's.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a single enantiomer, so perhaps the starting material is chiral and the reduction is stereoselective.

Wait, another possibility: The starting material has a stereocenter that is retained or inverted during the reduction and cyclization steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a chiral center, which upon reduction forms an alcohol with a certain configuration, leading to the specific configuration in the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester with a chiral center. Let me imagine that:

The structure is RCOCH2COOR', where R and R' are substituents. Suppose R is such that the gamma-keto ester has a chiral center. When reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter.

Wait, but gamma-keto esters are symmetrical, so maybe the starting material isn't symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, but then the product is a cyclic ketone, so that wouldn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different configurations for A and B.

The products are (R) and (S) configurations of the same compound.

So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R). When B is treated with BH3, it gives (S).

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reducing abilities. LiBH4 is stronger and can reduce esters, while BH3 usually doesn't. So the starting materials must be different such that with LiBH4, you get R, and with BH3, you get S.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are different enantiomers. But let's see.

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S).

Option C says A is (S) and B is (R).

So, when A is (R), using LiBH4 gives (R) product. When B is (S), using BH3 gives (S) product.

Wait, but why would the same starting material with different configurations give different products?

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents cause the formation of different diastereomers.

Wait, but the product is a single enantiomer, so perhaps the reaction's stereochemistry is influenced by the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone. When reduced with LiBH4, it forms an alcohol with a certain configuration, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, another thought: The ketone reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 could lead to different stereoselectivity. But I'm not sure about that. Typically, BH3 is used for ketone reductions with anti addition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters of a chiral center. When LiBH4 reduces the ester to an alcohol, the configuration is set, which then leads to the specific configuration in the product.

Wait, let me think of the mechanism for the product formation.

Assuming the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example, the structure is CH2CH2CO-O-R, but with substituents.

When LiBH4 reduces the ketone group, the carbonyl becomes an alcohol. So, the structure becomes CH2CH2CH(OH)-O-R.

Then, under acidic conditions, this alcohol could undergo cyclization. The OH attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester, leading to the formation of a ring. The ester is at one end, so the ring would be five or six-membered.

Wait, if the ester is at the end, and the alcohol is three carbons away, the ring would be five-membered. But the product is a six-membered ring, so perhaps the starting material is longer.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has five carbons between the ketone and the ester. So, when reduced, the alcohol is four carbons away, allowing a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction forms a different structure, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. But that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the stereoselectivity.

When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material is chiral, it can influence the approach.

Wait, but ketones are planar, so the hydride can attack from either side. So unless the starting material is chiral and the reduction leads to a new chiral center with a certain configuration based on the starting material's configuration, the product would be racemic.

But in this case, the product is a single enantiomer, which suggests that the starting material is chiral and the reduction is stereoselective.

Wait, so perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that affects the reduction's outcome.

For example, if the starting material is (R), the reduction leads to (R) product, and if it's (S), it leads to (S).

But that depends on the mechanism. If the reduction proceeds with retention or inversion, which for ketone reductions, it's typically a planar attack, so the product's configuration would be random unless directed by the existing chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration causes the hydride to attack from a particular face, leading to a specific configuration in the alcohol, which then leads to the ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration is such that after reduction and cyclization, the product has the opposite or same configuration.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's a bit tricky.

Another approach: Look at the options and see which pair makes sense.

Option D says A is (R), B is (S). So, when A is (R) and treated with LiBH4, it gives (R) product. When B is (S) and treated with BH3, it gives (S) product.

Wait, but why would the same starting material with opposite configurations give opposite products? Maybe because the reducing agents cause the opposite configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 could have different selectivities. For example, LiBH4 might give the R configuration, and BH3 might give the S configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the product's configuration, and the choice of reducing agent doesn't affect that.

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration is the same as the starting material's. But in this case, the products are R and S, so the starting materials must be R and S.

Looking at the options, option D says A is R and B is S.

So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, product is R. When B (S) is treated with BH3, product is S.

So, the configurations of the starting materials directly influence the product's configuration.

Thus, the correct starting materials are A = R and B = S, which is option D.

So, the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric cyclic ketones, (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key lies in understanding the relationship between the starting materials, the reducing agents, and the stereochemistry of the products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with an ethyl group at position 4 and a ketone at position 2. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reduction mechanism.

2. **Reducing Agents**:
   - **LiBH4** is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters and ketones to alcohols.
   - **BH3** is typically used for ketone reductions and is weaker than LiBH4.

3. **Starting Materials**: The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. These are chiral molecules with a ketone group at position 5 and an isobutoxy group at the same position.

4. **Reaction Mechanism**:
   - The starting materials undergo reduction followed by cyclization to form the cyclic ketone. The stereochemistry of the starting material influences the stereochemistry of the product because the reduction step introduces a new stereocenter, and the configuration of the starting material directs the hydride attack.

5. **Stereochemical Outcome**:
   - When the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the reduction and cyclization yield the (R)-enantiomer of the product.
   - Conversely, when the starting material is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the reduction and cyclization yield the (S)-enantiomer of the product.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would produce only the (S)-enantiomer of the product, which is inconsistent with the given products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This would produce only the (R)-enantiomer of the product, which is also inconsistent with the given products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would produce the (S)-enantiomer from A and the (R)-enantiomer from B, which matches the given products.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This would produce the (R)-enantiomer from A and the (S)-enantiomer from B, which also matches the given products.

7. **Conclusion**: Both options C and D are consistent with the stereochemical outcome of the reactions. However, based on the standard stereochemical conventions and the relationship between the starting materials and products, **Option D** (A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) is the most logical choice.

ANSWER: D
