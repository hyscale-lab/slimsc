Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, so there's an ester functional group somewhere in the molecule. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals: two for aromatic hydrogens, two for vinyl hydrogens (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for -CH3 groups. And importantly, there are no -CH2 signals. The possible formulas are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So first, let's think about the structure. It's a di-substituted benzene ring. The substituents must account for the ester group and whatever else is present.

Ester groups are usually in the form R-O-CO-R'. So the compound might be something like an aromatic ester, maybe a substituted phenyl ester.

Now, the NMR tells us about the structure. Let's go through each part.

First, the aromatic protons. There are two signals, meaning there are two sets of equivalent aromatic hydrogens. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents determine the symmetry. For example, if the two substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: those adjacent to substituents and those opposite. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, the aromatic Hs would be in a different arrangement.

Wait, but the question says it's di-substituted. So, the substituents are in positions that lead to two types of aromatic protons. Let's think about the possibilities. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, then the ring would be symmetric, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs. If they're in meta positions, that might lead to more Hs? Or maybe the substituents are in such a way that two types of Hs are present. Wait, but in a di-substituted benzene, depending on the positions, the number of H signals can vary.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs. So, perhaps the ring is such that there are two equivalent sets of Hs. Maybe it's a para-disubstituted ring where the substituents are para, leading to two sets of Hs. Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where the substituents are meta, but that would give more signals, right? Or maybe the substituents are in positions that cause two equivalent Hs each, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I'll come back to this.

Next, the vinyl protons. There are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are adjacent to double bonds, so maybe we have an alkene group somewhere, perhaps adjacent to the ester.

Wait, the ester group is likely part of the substituent on the benzene ring. So perhaps the ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester group, and the other might be another group, maybe a vinyl group or something else.

The vinyl signals: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet could mean coupling with one neighboring proton, while a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two sets of protons or maybe two neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans coupling in a double bond, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl protons are adjacent to an oxygen, like an ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group connected to a vinyl group. For example, maybe it's a structure like benzene with an ester substituent where the ester is connected to a CH2CH2 group. Wait, but that would have more Hs, but let's see.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring might be an ester group and another group, perhaps an alkoxy group or a vinyl group. But the presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond adjacent to the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group attached to a vinyl group. So, it's something like benzene-O-CO-O-R, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, ester is R-O-CO-R', so perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester group (like O-CO-R) and another group, say a vinyl group (like CH2CH2 or something else).

But let's think about the NMR signals:

- Two aromatic Hs: so two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Let's say the substituents are in positions that create two sets of equivalent Hs. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring may have two types of Hs, perhaps in meta positions relative to substituents.

- The vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, which could be a trans coupling, like in a double bond where each H is coupled to one other H. The other is a doublet of quartets, which might be more complex coupling, perhaps if there are two neighboring groups or maybe coupling with adjacent Hs.

- The two CH3 signals: so two sets of methyl groups. They could be from the ester group, perhaps as R and R' in R-O-CO-R'. For example, if the ester is something like O-CO-O-R, but more likely, the ester is an aryl ester, but perhaps with an alkyl group attached to the oxygen.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the ester structure. An ester is R-O-CO-R', so if R is an alkyl group, like methyl, then the ester would have a CH3 group. But in that case, the -O-CO-O- would be part of the substituent on the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (like O-CO-R) and another group that has a vinyl group. So the other substituent could be, say, CH2CH2-O- attached to the ring, but that's getting a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2-something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2CH2-O-CO-R. Hmm, but then the vinyl Hs would be on the CH2CH2 part.

Wait, but let's think about the number of signals. So, the aromatic Hs have two signals, the vinyl Hs have two signals, and the CH3 groups have two signals. So, perhaps the substituent has a structure that leads to two CH3 groups. For example, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that has two methyl groups, like maybe an ester group connected to another group that has a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent includes an ethyl group, which would have a CH2 and a CH3. But the problem states there are no CH2 groups in the NMR. Wait, the NMR has no signals corresponding to CH2. So that suggests that any CH2 groups are either not present or perhaps are in a symmetrical position, leading to no signal. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 groups are split into other signals, but I don't think so. So, the molecule doesn't have any CH2 groups. So, the substituents must not include any CH2.

Wait, that's an important point. So the compound has no CH2 groups. So any substituents on the benzene ring that include CH2 would be excluded. So perhaps the substituents are such that any chains are either single bonds or have no methylene groups.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. If R is a methyl group, then the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. That would contribute a CH3 group. Alternatively, if R is an ethyl group, that would have CH2 groups, which would produce signals, but the problem states there are no CH2 signals. So perhaps R can't be an ethyl or larger. So maybe R is a methyl group.

Wait, but the ester is O-CO-O-R. If R is a methyl, then the ester substituent would be O-CO-OCH3. So that would give a methyl group.

But then, maybe there's another substituent on the ring, which is a vinyl group, like a CH2CH2 group. But that would have CH2 groups, which aren't present. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected directly, like a CH2=CH-O- group, but that would have CH2 groups. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, but in a way that doesn't introduce any CH2 groups. For example, maybe it's a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O- attached, but that would have CH2 groups, which we can't have. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a styryl group (like a vinyl connected to the ring), but then where is the ester?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like (CH2=CH)COOR, but that would have CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring. So, for example, the benzene is di-substituted with an ester group and a vinyl group.

Wait, but the vinyl group would be attached as a substituent, like a -CH2CH2COOR, but that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH2O- group attached, but again, that brings in CH2.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent that doesn't have CH2 groups. For example, maybe the substituent is a phenyl group ester, but that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a cyclo structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to think about the NMR signals again. The six signals are:

- 2 aromatic H signals
- 2 vinyl H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)
- 2 CH3 signals

And no CH2 signals.

So, maybe the substituents on the benzene are an ester group and another group that has a vinyl structure without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to a benzyl group, but that seems unlikely. Or maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-O-R, but again, that would have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is a vinyl group that's part of a ring, so there are no CH2 groups. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group (O-CO-OCH3) and another group that is a vinyl group. So, the benzene has two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3 and the other is CH2=CH-something.

Wait, but then the CH2 in the vinyl would give a CH2 signal, which we don't have. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group connected to the ester. For example, maybe it's a structure like O-CO-CH2CH2-O- attached, but that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the molecular formula for each option to see which makes sense.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The molecular formula of benzene is C6H6. So the substituents would add to this.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so the benzene ring has two substituents. Each substituent would contribute to the molecular formula.

An ester group is usually O-CO-O-R. Wait, no: ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, for example, if one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), then the formula would include that.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the benzene has two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH2 attached as a substituent). Wait, but that would require more carbons.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are such. Let's think about the total number of carbons.

Option C is C12H12O2. Benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents would have 6 + 6 = 12. So the substituents contribute 6 carbons. But if each substituent is, say, an ester group, that's more.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an ester group. No, that would be more than two substituents. Wait, no, the compound is di-substituted, so only two substituents on the benzene.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group.

Wait, let's think about the ester. Let's say one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), which contributes 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH3 is O=C(OCH3)-O- attached to benzene). So that would add 3 carbons.

Then the other substituent is a group that contributes 3 more carbons, bringing the total to 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. So the formula would be C12H14O2 or similar, depending on hydrogen counts.

Wait, but let me calculate the molecular formula.

Benzene (C6H6) plus two substituents.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester group). This adds O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 carbons in the ester group (the methyl part). So substituent 1 contributes 3 carbons.

Substituent 2: Let's say it's a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2. But that's 2 carbons, but it's a vinyl substituent attached as a single bond, so maybe it's CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. Wait, but that would be a styrene substituent, which has a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, no, a vinyl group is CH2=CH-. So if the substituent is CH2=CH-, that's two carbons. But then, that substituent would add 2 carbons.

Wait, but adding O-CO-OCH3 (3C) and CH2=CH- (2C) would give 6 +3+2=11C. So the molecular formula would be C11H? O2.

Wait, let's calculate the hydrogens. Benzene has 6 H. Each substituent may replace one H each.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3. The ester group has O-CO-OCH3, which is attached as an electron-withdrawing group. The OCH3 is a methoxy group, but wait, no, in ester it's R-O-CO-O-R'?

Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, if the benzene ring has an ester group, perhaps it's O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl. For example, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). But that would have more carbons.

Wait, in any case, perhaps I should approach this by considering the degrees of unsaturation.

Each ring or double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. So, for a benzene ring (3 rings/double bonds), plus any other rings or double bonds.

Let's take the formula C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation calculation:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=14/2=7. So 7 degrees: 3 from benzene, 1 from ester carbonyl, 1 from ester oxygen (but wait, no, ester is O-CO-O, which has a double bond in the carbonyl. So that's one more double bond. Then, if there's a vinyl group (another double bond), that's two more. So 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. So to reach 7, there must be more rings or double bonds.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, taking option C: C12H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 12*2 +2=26; 26-12=14; 14/2=7.

So 7 degrees: benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), vinyl (1), and two more. Maybe another ring or another double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps another substituent with a ring or double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and a vinyl group that's part of a ring, like a cyclopropyl group, but that may complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl ester, but that would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ester group and another substituent that's a vinyl group connected to a benzyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes an ester and a vinyl group as part of a larger structure, like a styrene ester.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester where the R' group is a vinyl group. For example, the ester is O-CO-CH2CH2-O- something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, perhaps the ester has two methyl groups. For example, the ester could be O-CO-OCH2CH3, but that would have a CH2, which we don't have. Alternatively, maybe the ester is O-CO-OCH3 and another group has a CH3. But wait, where else would a CH3 come from? Maybe the other substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring, but that would be a simple substituent, but then the vinyl group would need to be part of another structure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like methyl salicylate, but that's a mono-substituted compound. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that has a vinyl and a methyl.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals more carefully.

The aromatic Hs: two signals. Let's think about di-substituted benzene with two groups para to each other. So, substituents at para positions. In that case, the aromatic Hs would be two sets: the Hs ortho to substituents and the Hs meta to substituents. Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, the Hs would be symmetrical.

Wait, no. If the substituents are para, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. So, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets: those adjacent to substituents (ortho) and those opposite (para). But wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite, so the ortho Hs would be equivalent, and the meta Hs (if any) would be equivalent as well. Wait, no. Let me correct: for a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is opposite. So, the ortho positions are adjacent to each substituent, but in that case, the H's in the ortho positions would be two sets: because each substituent has its own ortho Hs. Wait, no, if substituents are at para positions, then the H's in the ortho positions would be equivalent. Because, for example, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B is at position 3 (assuming positions 1 and 3 are not para, wait, no, para would be positions 1 and 4). Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are para. So if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to substituent 1, and the Hs at 3 and 5 are ortho to substituent 4. But if substituents are identical, then Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and Hs at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So, in that case, the aromatic Hs would be two signals: one for the Hs adjacent to substituent 1 (positions 2 and 6) and another for the Hs adjacent to substituent 4 (positions 3 and 5). Wait, no, that would be two sets. So that would match the NMR data: two aromatic signals.

So, the substituents are para to each other, each contributing to their own set of adjacent Hs. So, that's good. Now, what about the substituents themselves.

One substituent is an ester group, the other is another group. Let's say substituent A is an ester, and substituent B is a vinyl group.

Wait, but the vinyl group would have Hs. The NMR shows two vinyl signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Let's think about the vinyl group structure.

A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring would have two Hs, but in the case of a substituent like -CH2CH2- attached to the ring, but that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is part of the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like, the ester is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that would have CH2 groups which we don't have.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but again, CH2 groups would appear, which we don't have.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group connected to the ester in a way that doesn't have CH2. For example, perhaps it's a group like O-CO-CH=CH2. That would be an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So, the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2. Let's see if that would fit.

In this case, the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH2 attached to the benzene ring. Then, the vinyl Hs would be on the CH=CH2 part.

So, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH=CH2. But wait, that would have a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) but attached as CH=CH2. So the Hs on the CH2 would be on the end.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2, but that would have CH2 groups. Hmm, no.

Wait, no, it's O-CO-CH=CH2. So, the structure is O-CO-CH2-CH2? No, wait, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2-CH2, but that's an ethyl group, which would have CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH=CH-O-R, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group. So, R-O-CO-R' where R' is a vinyl group.

Wait, so the substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-X, but that brings in CH2 again.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR signals again.

The vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests each H is coupling with one other H, perhaps a trans coupling across a double bond.

The doublet of quartets suggests each H is coupling with two different sets of Hs. Maybe each H is next to two different Hs, such as in a coupling with two different neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but again, that introduces CH2 groups which we don't have.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R but that's a glyceryl group, but again, that's more CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's a longer chain. No, I think I'm stuck here.

Let me think about the CH3 groups. There are two sets of CH3 in the NMR. So perhaps the ester has two different methyl groups. For example, the ester could be O-CO-OCH3 and another CH3 elsewhere.

Wait, but where else would another CH3 come from? Maybe the other substituent is a methyl group.

Wait, but the substituents are para. So, one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and the other substituent is a methyl group.

Wait, but the substituent cannot be a methyl group because that would make it a mono-substituted then di-substituted, but the other substituent would be O-CO-OCH3 and a methyl group.

Wait, but how would that affect the NMR?

In that case, the aromatic Hs would be two signals (as we have para substituents), the ester's OCH3 would be a singlet in the NMR, but wait, the problem states that the CH3 signals are two, so perhaps there's another CH3 group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a larger group. For example, the substituent is O-CO-(CH2)0CH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2, but that would have a CH(CH3)2 group, leading to more complex signals.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is an ester where R' is a methyl group. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, but that would have a CH3. Then, maybe the other substituent is a vinyl group which is connected to a CH3, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH3 (ethyl ester), but that would have CH2 groups, which we can't have. So, that's out.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-Ph (phenyl ester), but that wouldn't contribute any CH3 groups. So that's not matching the NMR.

Another approach: the NMR has two CH3 signals, so perhaps each CH3 is attached to a different environment. For example, one CH3 is part of an ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is part of a vinyl group attached to another substituent.

Wait, but a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) wouldn't have a CH3. So maybe the other substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring, but then the aromatic Hs would be in a different arrangement.

Wait, if one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 and the other is a methyl group, then the aromatic Hs would be in two sets (as para substituents). The CH3 from the OCH3 would be a singlet, and the CH3 from the methyl group would be another singlet. But the problem states that the CH3 signals are two, which would fit. But wait, the methyl group attached to the ring would be a single CH3, so that would result in two CH3 signals: one from the ester's OCH3 and another from the ring's CH3. So that would explain the two CH3 signals.

But wait, the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (ester) and CH3 (methyl). Then, the aromatic Hs would be two signals (para positions). The ester's OCH3 would have a singlet in the NMR (around δ 3.8 or so), and the methyl group attached to the ring would have a singlet as well (around δ 2.6 perhaps). So that would give two CH3 signals.

But what about the vinyl Hs? If the substituent is a methyl group, where are the vinyl Hs? That doesn't add up. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. What if the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Let's say the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O- something. But again, that introduces CH2.

Wait, another idea: the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that would have CH2 groups, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's again with CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-X, but that brings back the CH2 issue.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the overall molecular formula.

The possible options are C11H12O2 (D), C11H14O2 (A), C12H12O2 (C), and C12H14O2 (B).

Assuming the benzene ring is C6H6.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), that's 3 carbons (COOCH3), and substituent 2 is a vinyl group (say, CH2=CH2), but that's 2 carbons. So total would be 6 +3 +2=11C. So the molecular formula would be C11H?O2.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 adds 3 carbons and contributes O2. Substituent 2: CH2=CH2 adds 2 carbons but as a substituent, how many H?

Wait, attaching CH2=CH2 as a substituent would add 4 H (since each CH2 has 2 H). But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, that would add two C and two H (since the CH2=CH- has two C and two H? Wait, no. CH2=CH- has two C and two H attached to the CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group that adds more Hs.

Wait, let's calculate the molecular formula for substituent 1 as O-CO-OCH3 (COOCH3 group). That's 3 C and 3 O, but wait, no. The formula for the substituent would be COOCH3, which is (COOCH3) group: 3 C (COO has two O, but the formula is O-CO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the entire structure.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH2, attached to the benzene ring, then the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-OCH3 and C6H5-CH2=CH2. But wait, that's not correct because the substituents are on the same benzene ring.

Wait, no. The benzene is di-substituted, so each substituent is attached to the ring. So, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (COOCH3 group), which is 3 C. Substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, which is 2 C. So total C is 6 +3 +2=11 C. So the formula would be C11H?O2.

But the benzene ring has 6 C, and each substituent adds more. The O-CO-OCH3 substituent is -O-CO-OCH3, which adds 3 C. The other substituent is CH2=CH2, which adds 2 C. So total C is 6 +3 +2=11. So the formula is C11H?O2.

Now, let's count the H. Benzene has 6 H, but two substituents replace two H, so 6 -2 =4 H from the ring. The substituent O-CO-OCH3 adds 3 H (from OCH3) and maybe other H from the ester group. Wait, no, the OCH3 is just a methyl group attached to oxygen in the ester, so it contributes 3 H. The substituent CH2=CH2 would contribute 2 H from the CH2 groups. Wait, but the CH2=CH2 group attached to the ring would have two H on the CH2 and two H on the CH2 group, but that's four H. Hmm, but I'm probably not counting this correctly.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring. So, substituent 2 is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, substituent 2 is CH2=CH- which has two C and two H (but not sure about the exact count).

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group that doesn't contribute any H, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula for the options.

Take option D: C11H12O2.

C:11, H:12, O:2.

The benzene ring (C6H6) plus substituents contributing 5 H. Because 6 H (benzene) - 2 H (replaced by substituents) =4 H. So substituents contribute 8 H. That seems high, but perhaps.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck on this approach. Maybe I should think about the degrees of unsaturation.

For each option:

Option C: C12H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7.

So, 7 degrees. Benzene has 3 (one ring and three double bonds from the ring). The ester group contributes one double bond (the carbonyl). So that's 4. Then, the vinyl group is another double bond, making 5. So that leaves two more degrees. That could be from two rings or two double bonds. But perhaps the substituent has another ring or another double bond.

Hmm, but maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (ester) and substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring in such a way that creates another double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyl group, but that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a group that includes a carbonyl and a double bond, contributing two more degrees of unsaturation. For example, an acetylenic group, but that's not indicated in the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps the formula with 12 C and 12 H (option C: C12H12O2) has the right number of degrees of unsaturation.

So, benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), vinyl (1), and two more degrees perhaps from another ring or double bond. But without knowing more, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group, each contributing a double bond, and the benzene ring contributing three, making a total of five. Then, two more degrees could be from another double bond or ring elsewhere.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the structure that would give the NMR signals described.

The NMR has two aromatic signals, which suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. Then, the substituents are para.

One substituent is the ester group (O-CO-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to the ring). Wait, but that would require the substituent to be CH2=CH-, which would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a group that includes a vinyl without any CH2. For example, the substituent could be a CH2=CH-O- group, but that would have an ether linkage, but that's part of the ester? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm. Perhaps I should think of the structure as a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and an allyl group. But that might include CH2 groups.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, the molecule has two different methyl groups. One of them is in the ester (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is perhaps in another group.

Wait, but where else would another CH3 come from? Maybe the substituent is a group that includes a methyl group, like a -CH2CH3 group, but that introduces CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH3 attached to the ring, but that would have CH2 groups. Which again, we can't have.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring attached to the ester, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes a methyl group without any CH2, like a gem-dimethyl group. But that's possible only in specific contexts.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the number of protons.

The 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic (integrate to 2H each?), two vinyl (maybe 2H each), and two CH3 (each integrating to 3H). Wait, but the aromatic might integrate to more than 2H. Wait, no, the question says two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, which could mean each signal represents a set of equivalent Hs. So, perhaps the ring has two sets, each with 2 Hs each.

Wait, let me think. If the benzene is di-substituted para, then the two substituents are opposite each other. Each substituent would have two Hs adjacent to it (ortho positions). So, the aromatic Hs would be two sets: each with 2 Hs. So, that would account for the two signals.

Then, the substituents themselves would contribute the rest of the Hs.

If one substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (which has a CH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group that has two Hs, perhaps arranged in a way that gives two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3. That contributes 3 H (from OCH3).

Substituent 2: a vinyl group, perhaps something like CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But that would bring in CH2 groups, which aren't allowed. So, unless the substituent is a group without CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected without CH2, like a phenyl group attached via a double bond. But that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aromatic group, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, but that includes CH2 groups.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the answer choices and see which makes sense.

The options are:

D) C11H12O2: 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

B) C12H14O2: 12 C, 14 H, 2 O.

A) C11H14O2.

C) C12H12O2.

The benzene is 6 C. The substituents add 5 or 6 C, depending on the option.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (3 C) and another substituent that's 3 C, like a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-), but that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that doesn't include CH2, like a cyclopropane or something else.

Wait, another approach: the number of H in the formula.

Option D: C11H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), vinyl (1), and two more. Maybe another ring or another double bond.

Option C: C12H12O2. Degrees: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7. So 7 degrees, as before.

But without knowing more, perhaps looking for a formula that fits the number of substituents and the H count.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 and another substituent that is a vinyl group without any CH2, which is challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, but that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is C11H14O2 (option A), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the ester group in the substituent would contribute to the molecular formula as O-CO-O-R. So, if R is a methyl group, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 C and 3 O (but the overall formula would have O2, as the ester has two O).

Wait, but the formula in the options already includes O2, so that's okay.

So, for substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 is 3 C and contributes O2.

Substituent 2: perhaps a CH2=CH2 group, but that's 2 C and 4 H.

Wait, but that would mean the formula is C6 (benzene) +3 (substituent 1) +2 (substituent 2) =11 C. So option D or A.

But the H count: benzene has 6 H, substituent 1 (O-CO-OCH3) doesn't add any H beyond the OCH3 (3 H). Substituent 2 (CH2=CH2) adds 4 H. So total H: 6 (benzene) -2 (replaced by substituents) +3 (OCH3) +4 (CH2=CH2) = 6-2=4 +3=7 +4=11. So total H would be 11.

But looking at the options, option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group that adds more H. For example, if substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O- (something), but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that doesn't add as much H.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group that's part of a larger group without CH2. For example, perhaps it's a CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3 group, but that brings CH2 groups again.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option C) C12H12O2.

Wait, but why? Because the substituents would add 6 C, making a total of 12.

Wait, how?

If substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C) and substituent 2 is a group with 3 C (like a propenyl group), but without CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-OCH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group connected to another group that adds 3 C without any CH2 groups, which is difficult.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, but that would add more C.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the NMR data, the two CH3 groups, the two aromatic signals, and the presence of a vinyl group, I think the correct formula is C11H14O2 (option A), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option C is C12H12O2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the degrees of unsaturation again. Let's take option C: C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 7.

Benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1), and two more. Perhaps a ring or another double bond. So maybe the substituent includes a ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane, contributing another degree.

Hmm, I think I'll have to go with option C) C12H12O2, but I'm not fully confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR data. The compound shows an ester group (from the IR spectrum) and six distinct signals in the NMR spectrum: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. There are no signals corresponding to CH2 groups.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Functional Group and Substituents**:
   - The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which has the general structure $R-O-CO-R'$. This suggests one substituent on the benzene ring is an ester group.
   - The NMR data shows two signals for aromatic protons, indicating a para-disubstituted benzene ring, where the two substituents are opposite each other. This symmetry results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

2. **Vinyl Protons**:
   - The NMR shows two vinyl proton signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This suggests the presence of a vinyl group ($CH=CH$) attached to the ring, with specific coupling patterns due to its electronic environment.

3. **Methyl Groups**:
   - The NMR shows two distinct methyl group signals, indicating two different methyl environments. One methyl group likely belongs to the ester ($OCH_3$), and the other may be part of another substituent.

4. **Absence of CH2 Groups**:
   - The NMR spectrum lacks signals for CH2 groups, meaning the molecule does not contain any methylene groups.

5. **Molecular Formula Analysis**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons. The two substituents must account for the remaining carbons in the molecular formula.
   - The ester group contributes 3 carbons ($COOCH_3$). The second substituent must contribute the remaining carbons, likely a vinyl group or another structure consistent with the NMR data.
   - The molecular formula must match the degrees of unsaturation:
     - Benzene contributes 3 degrees of unsaturation.
     - The ester carbonyl contributes 1 degree.
     - The vinyl group contributes 1 degree.
     - Additional degrees of unsaturation may come from another double bond or ring.

6. **Option Evaluation**:
   - **Option A (C11H14O2)**:
     - Degrees of unsaturation: $(2(11) + 2 - 14)/2 = 6$.
     - This accounts for the benzene ring (3), ester carbonyl (1), and vinyl group (1), leaving 2 additional degrees of unsaturation. This could be consistent with the structure.
   - **Option B (C12H14O2)**:
     - Degrees of unsaturation: $(2(12) + 2 - 14)/2 = 7$.
     - This suggests an additional degree of unsaturation, which is not supported by the NMR data.
   - **Option C (C12H12O2)**:
     - Degrees of unsaturation: $(2(12) + 2 - 12)/2 = 7$.
     - This accounts for the benzene ring (3), ester carbonyl (1), and vinyl group (1), leaving 3 additional degrees of unsaturation. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.
   - **Option D (C11H12O2)**:
     - Degrees of unsaturation: $(2(11) + 2 - 12)/2 = 6$.
     - This matches the benzene ring (3), ester carbonyl (1), and vinyl group (1), with no additional degrees of unsaturation. This is consistent with the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the NMR data and molecular formula analysis, the compound is most consistent with **C11H12O2**.
