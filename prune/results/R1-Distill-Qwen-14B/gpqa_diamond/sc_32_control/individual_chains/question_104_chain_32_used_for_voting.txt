Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The problem says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have planets detected using RV. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The key here is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period. Oh, wait, no, more specifically, the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

The formula I recall is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) )^(1/3) ) ) ), but wait, since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ).

Wait, let me think. Another version I remember is K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet / M_star) )^(1/3) ) ), but since M_planet is much smaller, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) ) * (M_planet) / ( (c) * (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about how the RV semi-amplitude K relates to the other variables. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, let's see. Alternatively, another form I remember is K = ( (v) ) = ( (27 * π) / (2 c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a relationship between the RV shifts and the orbital periods. Since both stars have the same mass (same M_star) and the planets have the same mass (same M_planet), because both are Neptune-like. So M_planet and M_star are the same for both planets.

In that case, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, let me think again. So K is proportional to (M_planet / (M_star^(2/3))) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ). So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3)

Because all other factors (M_planet, M_star) are the same.

But in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7 milliangstrom. So K1 =5, K2=7.

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We need to find P2/P1. Let me rearrange.

Let’s take (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Compute (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. That would mean P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Hmm, wait, it's 0.36 times, which is shorter. So the period of Planet #2 is shorter than that of Planet #1. So the ratio is about 0.36.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, meaning P2 is shorter, not longer. So that would be option A, ~0.36.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula. The semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases. So if planet #2 has a larger K (7 >5), its period is smaller. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343=approx 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's 0.36 times longer, which is actually shorter. So the answer is option A, ~0.36.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), and depends on the masses of the planet and star. Since both stars in this problem have the same mass, and both planets have similar masses, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the RV shifts for Planet #1 and Planet #2 are 5 milliangstrom and 7 milliangstrom, respectively, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

From the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), we can relate the periods as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is shorter than Planet #1's by a factor of approximately 0.36.
