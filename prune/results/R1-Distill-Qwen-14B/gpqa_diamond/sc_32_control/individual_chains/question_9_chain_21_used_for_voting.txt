Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me about molecular symmetry. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... Wait, what's that again?

I remember that symmetry elements in molecules are important for understanding their structure and properties. C3h, I think, is a type of symmetry. Let me think about the different symmetry groups. Oh right, the C3h point group has a threefold rotation axis (C3), a mirror plane (σ), and maybe some other elements. Or wait, C3h is actually a combination of a C3 rotation and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, the h in C3h stands for horizontal, so the mirror plane is horizontal. So the molecule would have a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So the molecule must have a threefold symmetry, meaning it looks the same after a 120-degree rotation, and also has a horizontal mirror plane. Let me look at the options.

The options are four molecules:

A) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) Triisopropyl borate

D) Quinuclidine

I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Let me start by recalling each molecule's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: Structure-wise, boron is in the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Wait, is that right? Triisopropyl borate would have a boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. So the molecule would have three identical substituents. So maybe it has some symmetry. Since all three substituents are the same, perhaps it has a threefold rotational axis. But what about the mirror planes?

Wait, triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3B. I remember that triisopropyl borane (or borate) has a trigonal planar structure because boron is in the center with three identical substituents. That would imply that it has a C3 axis, but what about a mirror plane?

I think trigonal planar molecules like BF3 don't have a center of inversion, but do they have a mirror plane? Wait, in trigonal planar, there are three mirror planes, each passing through a bond and the opposite vertex. So for triisopropyl borate, each of the isopropyl groups is the same, so the molecule has C3v symmetry, not C3h. Or wait, maybe it's C3. Because in C3v, the vertical mirror planes are present. Alternatively, perhaps it has C3h symmetry if it has a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, no. If the molecule is trigonal planar, like in the case of BH3, the symmetry is D3h, which has a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, D3h has a principal axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (h), and several other elements. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

For triisopropyl borate, the structure is trigonal planar, so each isopropyl is in a plane around the boron. So, the molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and three mirror planes that are vertical (each passes through B and a substituent). So that would be C3v symmetry, which is a subgroup under D3h.

Wait, but wait. For C3h, the horizontal mirror plane is present. So, if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (like in a planar structure), then perhaps it's D3h. Wait, D3h has higher symmetry than C3h. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, the molecule with C3h symmetry would have a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think of each option.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Its structure is like a bridge with three bridges of two carbons each. So, it's a norbornane-like structure. Quinuclidine has a high degree of symmetry. Let me think about its symmetry elements.

Quinuclidine has a C3 axis. If you rotate it 120 degrees around the axis that goes through the central nitrogen, the molecule should look the same. Also, are there any mirror planes? I think it has three mirror planes that pass through the central nitrogen and each pair of opposite hydrogen atoms. So, it has a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes. So, the symmetry would be D3h? Or maybe C3v?

Wait, no, perhaps quinuclidine has a threefold axis and mirror planes, making it D3h symmetry. Hmm, but D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h. Or am I getting this wrong?

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. As I thought earlier, it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So it should have a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes, making it C3v symmetry. So, that's not C3h, which has a horizontal mirror plane.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's parse the name. Triphenyleno indicates three phenyl groups attached. Trifuran means three furan rings? The numbering is a bit complex, but I think the molecule has a central structure with three substituents, each being a furan ring with some substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's a tricyclic compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule where three phenyl groups are attached to a central structure with three furan rings. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a derivative of something like a trioxane with substituents. Wait, maybe it's a tricyclic compound with three six-membered rings attached to a central structure.

But regardless, the key is to look for a threefold symmetry. So if the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, it could have a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Let me think of another approach. If a molecule has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then perhaps looking for a structure that is symmetric in that way.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's another complex name. Benzo indicates a benzene ring substituent. Trifuran would imply three furan rings. The way the substituents are attached might create a symmetric structure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a central structure where three furan rings are attached at 120-degree angles. If that's the case, then perhaps it has a threefold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar, which would allow a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structures of each and their symmetry.

Let me try to visualize each molecule.

Triisopropyl borate: three isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. So, the structure is trigonal planar. So, the molecule has a C3 axis and vertical mirror planes. So, C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Quinuclidine: as I thought earlier, a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. It has a threefold rotation axis and three mirror planes, but not a horizontal one? Or does it?

Wait, maybe quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think: the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees, but does it have any mirror planes? Yes, I think it has a center of inversion, but wait, no, that's for molecules like methane. Quinuclidine has a structure where there are three equivalent positions. If it's symmetric across a plane, then perhaps it has a horizontal mirror plane. Oh, wait, the molecule is non-planar. So maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror plane. So its symmetry would be C3, not C3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about each molecule.

C3h symmetry means that the molecule has a threefold rotation (so C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a horizontal plane.

Looking for such a molecule.

Triphenyleno... (Option A). If this molecule has three substituents (like three benzene rings) attached symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal planar arrangement, then there's a threefold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is flat, making a horizontal mirror plane possible.

Option B: Benzo...trifuran. Maybe it's a molecule with three benzene rings attached to a central structure, but with furan rings. Wait, perhaps the attachment points are arranged symmetrically.

But without knowing the exact structure, this is tough.

Wait, I've heard that triphenylene has C3h symmetry. Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way. Oh wait, Triphenylene is a [2.2.2]paracyclophane, where three benzene rings are connected by bridgehead positions. So it has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So if option A is triphenylene with trifuran substituents, would it have the same symmetry?

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about the actual options.

Wait, the options are:

A) Triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) Benzo[...]trifuran...

So perhaps option A has three benzene rings attached in a symmetric way, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again about each option.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has a trigonal planar structure, which is C3v. So no C3h.

Quinuclidine (option D) has a C3 axis and three mirror planes, but I'm not sure if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Because if the molecule is non-planar, the horizontal plane might not be a symmetry element.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure has a central trifuran, which is three furan rings connected. The benzo substituents are attached in a way that could create a symmetric arrangement. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this creates a C3h symmetry.

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, an alternative approach: C3h symmetry implies that the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and reflection across a horizontal plane. So, if you spin it 120 degrees and then flip it over a horizontal plane, it looks the same.

Which of these molecules would fit that?

Triphenylene is a flat molecule (like a [2.2.2]paracyclophane), which is known to have C3h symmetry. But option A is Triphenyleno[...], which adds trifuran substituents. Wait, if the substituents are added symmetrically, then the molecule would retain its C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all the same and arranged symmetrically, then yes.

But I'm not totally sure. Another angle: which of these are known to have C3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm trying to recall. Triphenylene has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so it's in the C3h point group. If option A is a derivative of triphenylene, perhaps it retains that symmetry.

Alternatively, sometimes substituents can lower the symmetry. But if the substituents are added in a symmetric way, the molecule would retain the point group.

So if option A's substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Let me think about the structure of triphenylene. It's a molecule with three benzene rings connected by bridge positions, making it look like a hexagon with three benzene rings attached at each opposite side. So yes, it's a symmetric structure with C3h symmetry.

So, if option A is a triphenylene derivative with three identical groups attached symmetrically, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the other options might not have that.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option A.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each option. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σᵦ). The molecule must look identical after a 120° rotation and reflection across a horizontal plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule is based on a triphenylene structure, which is a [2.2.2]paracyclophane with three benzene rings arranged symmetrically. The addition of trifuran substituents, if done symmetrically, would retain the **C₃h** symmetry. The molecule has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it consistent with **C₃h** symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule has a central trifuran structure with benzo substituents. While it may have a threefold rotation axis due to the symmetric arrangement of substituents, it does not appear to have a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. It has a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and three vertical mirror planes, giving it **C₃v** symmetry, not **C₃h** symmetry.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen atom. It has a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and three vertical mirror planes, but it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it has **C₃v** symmetry, not **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The only molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry is **Option A**, as it retains the threefold rotation axis and horizontal mirror plane characteristic of the triphenylene structure, even with the trifuran substituents added symmetrically.

**Answer: A**
