Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

Alright, the question is about wave functions and normalization, I think. So, the setup is that there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but why is there an imaginary component here? Because i is the square root of -1, right?

The problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but in our case, the wave function is given as that expression in a part where it can exist. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the regions. Wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But if measurements show that all particles are between x=1 and x=3, then the wave function must be non-zero only in that region. Otherwise, the probability of finding a particle elsewhere would be zero.

Wait, but the wave function given isn't zero outside x=1 to x=3. Or is that assumption incorrect? Because if the wave function is non-zero elsewhere, but the measurements don't find any particles there, that suggests that the wave function's probability is zero outside. Hmm, maybe the wave function given is only valid between x=1 and x=3, not outside. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, the question says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero? Because the problem states that none were found outside that interval. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Or maybe the wave function is given as that expression, but it's zero outside. 

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So, that part of space where it can exist is between x=1 and x=3. So elsewhere (x<1, x>3), the wave function is zero. So the wave function is non-zero only in [1,3], and zero outside.

So, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. But wait, that would mean ψ is a complex function. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

But wait, if the wave function has an imaginary part, then the probability density would involve the square of the modulus. Let me think. The given ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ = A - i B, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), and B=0.5. So, |ψ|^2 = (A)^2 + (B)^2. Because (A - i B)(A + i B) = A² + B².

So the probability density is [ (a²)/(1+x) ) ] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but considering that when x is not between 1 and 3, ψ is zero. So the integral of the probability density over all x should equal 1, because it's a normalized wave function.

So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must be 1.

So, let's compute that integral.

|ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: Integral [ a²/(1+x) ] dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So,

a² * [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ) ] = a² * ln(4/2) ) = a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 -1 ) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding both parts: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So, a = sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So close. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the second integral: from 1 to3, the length is 2, so 0.25 * 2 = 0.5. Correct.

First integral: a² ( ln(4) - ln(2) ) = a² ln(2). Because ln(4)=2 ln(2). So, yes, 4 is 2^2, so ln(4) = 2 ln(2). So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² ln(2).

So equation: a² ln(2) = 0.5. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7202.

So a is sqrt(0.7202) = approx 0.8485, which is about 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but the options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So the correct answer should be B)0.85.

Wait, but looking back, did I compute the integral correctly? Let me confirm.

Yes, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) from 1 to3 is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). Then the other term is 0.5. So the sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Yes, that's correct.

So, a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7202.

sqrt(0.7202) is approx 0.8485, which rounds to 0.85, so answer B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]
and \( \psi(x) = 0 \) elsewhere. The wave function is normalized, meaning the total probability must integrate to 1 over the region where the particle exists (\( x \in [1, 3] \)).

The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which for a complex wave function \( \psi(x) = A - iB \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = A^2 + B^2.
\]

Here, \( A = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and \( B = 0.5 \), so:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we split the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals gives:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( a \approx 0.85 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) 0.85.**
