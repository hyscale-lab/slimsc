Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector for a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about a muon, which I think is just another fermion, similar to an electron, so the quantum mechanical principles should apply similarly. The operator in question is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector when it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, but the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. I remember that for spin operators, the total operator P is the vector sum of its components, so P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z, where n is the direction vector. But wait, the question says that n lies in the x-z plane. So, n_x and n_z are non-zero, and n_y is zero? Or wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction is given by angles θ and φ, but since it's in x-z, the y-component of n is zero. So the direction vector n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), assuming the usual spherical coordinates. But since it's in x-z, phi is either 0 or 180 or something, so maybe n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, I think in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. So, in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, because x-z is the plane where y=0. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is measured from the z-axis. 

The eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator P·n, right? Because the operator is along direction n, so the operator is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Wait, the eigenvalue for this operator is +ħ/2. So the equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Our task is to find the normalized eigenvector of P·n corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

The options given are all in terms of hbar and angles. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but I'm not sure. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and 1/3 factors, multiplied by hbar and theta/2. Hmm.

Wait, but the given components of P_x, P_y, and P_z are each 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component is already (ħ/2) times a matrix.

So P_x is [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, P_y is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

And P_z is [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the operator P·n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, no, because each component P_x, etc., is already scaled by ħ/2. So the operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by ħ/2? Or wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, no. Each component P_x, etc., is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix. So the actual operator for P_x is (ħ/2) * [ [0,1],[1,0] ], similarly for others.

So when n is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and the operator P·n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). But each P component is already ħ/2 times a matrix. So P·n would be (n_x (ħ/2) P_x_matrix) + (n_z (ħ/2) P_z_matrix).

But wait, the direction vector n is a unit vector. So n_x² + n_z² = 1. So, the operator can be written as (ħ/2)(n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

But since the eigenvalue is ħ/2, the equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, the eigenvalue equation is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, no. Because P·n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by ħ/2. So, (ħ/2) (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the operator is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), and we're looking for its eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) with eigenvalue 1.

Given that P_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, n_x is a coefficient, and n_z is another. But since n is a direction, and in the x-z plane, n_x and n_z are related by n_x² + n_z² =1. So, let me write n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, since in the x-z plane, polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, wait. Let me think about the direction. If theta is the angle from the z-axis, then in the x-z plane, the x-component is sinθ, and z is cosθ. So yes, n_x= sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

So the operator becomes (sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z).

So substituting the P_x and P_z matrices:

P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator matrix is:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, let me calculate each element:

Top-left: 0 * sinθ + 1 * cosθ = cosθ.

Top-right: 1 * sinθ + 0 * cosθ = sinθ.

Bottom-left: 1 * sinθ + 0 * cosθ = sinθ.

Bottom-right: 0 * sinθ + (-1) * cosθ = -cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We're looking for the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue 1.

So the equation is:

[ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] |v> = 0.

Let me write the system of equations from this matrix equation.

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0.

We can solve for v1 and v2.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) v1 = - sinθ v2.

So v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] v2.

Hmm, but cosθ -1 is the same as -(1 - cosθ), so:

v1 = [ - sinθ / (- (1 - cosθ) ) ] v2

Which simplifies to v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2.

Now, 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

sin theta / (1 - cos theta) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] = [cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2).

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

So, we can write v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Let me choose v2 as a parameter, say v2 = sin(theta/2), then v1 would be cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

Wait, because cot is cos/sin, so cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So, v1 = [cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So v1 = cos(theta/2), v2 = sin(theta/2).

Wait, but wait, that would give the vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is what option C is: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, let me check with equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0.

Substituting v1 = cos(theta/2), v2 = sin(theta/2):

sinθ cos(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) sin(theta/2) = 0?

Let me compute each term.

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So first term: [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2).

Second term: (- (cos theta) -1 ) * sin(theta/2) = [ - (cos theta +1) ] * sin(theta/2).

But cos theta = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1. So,

cos theta + 1 = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So the second term becomes [ - 2 cos²(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2).

So the equation becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = 0.

Which is 0. So the substitution is correct.

Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, the question says to find the normalized eigenvector. Let's check the normalization.

The vector's squared magnitude is cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1. So it's already normalized.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me read the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but in the problem statement, the options are in terms of hbar multiplied by these factors. Wait, no, looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar )

Option B: (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta )

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) )

So, our conclusion is that the normalized eigenvector is option C, which is just (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait another thing: the given options are written as vectors with components, but in quantum mechanics, these are usually written as column vectors. So, for instance, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is a row vector. But the actual eigenvector is a column vector. But since the options are written as tuples, perhaps it's in the same form.

Wait, but another thought: The operator P·n corresponds to the spin-1/2 operator in the direction n, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

In the standard basis, the spin-up state along n is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which matches what we found.

So, yes, the correct answer should be option C. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ for a muon, where $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and has components $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The eigenvalue is given as $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$ and using $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we find:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1) v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0 \implies v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
v_1 = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} v_2 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2.
\]

Choosing $v_2 = \sin(\theta/2)$ (to normalize the eigenvector), we find $v_1 = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing with the options, this matches option C:

\[
\text{Option C: } \left( \cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2) \right).
\]

The other options are incorrect because they either include unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ or do not match the derived eigenvector.
