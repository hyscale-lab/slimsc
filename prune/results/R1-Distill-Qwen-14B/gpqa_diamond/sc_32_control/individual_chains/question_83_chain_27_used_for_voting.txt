Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, so first, I think I should figure out the concentrations after the initial dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution factor.

So, the initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution would be (volume1/total volume) * initial concentration. Oh wait, because dilution follows M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The neutralization reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH initially.

Wait, but wait, I should calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Let me see. Before dilution, moles = M * V = 0.05 M * 0.02 L (because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.025 M as I found. But when titrating, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are same as before, because adding water doesn't change moles, just the concentration.

Wait, no, the initial moles are same as before dilution, because dilution doesn't add or remove moles. So the moles of CH3COOH after dilution are still 0.001 moles.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach equivalence point can be found. Because at equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH3COOH. So moles NaOH = 0.001 moles. Volume NaOH = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added when it's 25% titrated.

So at 25% titration, how much of the acetic acid has reacted? Let's think.

The reaction is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH. So, moles of NaOH added at 25% is 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.25 mL *0.1 = 0.025 L *0.1 = 0.0025 mol. Wait, no, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L, so 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, wait, maybe I should redo that calculation. 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So since the reaction is 1:1, this means 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So after neutralizing 0.00025 mol, we have 0.00075 mol of acetic acid left, and 0.00025 mol of acetate.

But wait, when you add NaOH to the solution, the total volume increases. So the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate will be based on the new total volume. So the total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L. Let me calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Similarly, concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since we're dealing with a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ log(5.405e4) → wait, wait, no. pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa ≈ 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So the 25% titration pH is around 4.256, which is close to 4.26. So the first part is 4.26.

Wait, but I thought that when you're 25% into titration, the pH would be lower, but this calculation gives pH around 4.26, which is higher than the initial pH before titration. Wait, was the initial pH of the diluted acetic acid lower than this?

Wait, let's check the initial pH before adding any NaOH. The diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. The pH can be found using Ka.

Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] → assuming x is [H+], so x²/(0.025 - x) ≈ 1.85e-5.

Since Ka is small, x is much smaller than 0.025, so 0.025 - x ≈ 0.025. So x² ≈ 1.85e-5 * 0.025 → 4.625e-7.

x = sqrt(4.625e-7) ≈ 6.80e-4 → pH = -log(6.8e-4) ≈ 3.17. So initial pH is about 3.17.

When we add NaOH, we're neutralizing some of the acid, so the pH should go up. So 4.26 makes sense for 25% titration.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.26 as the first value except option A. Let me check other options. Option A's first value is 4.26, which matches our 25% titration. But I need to check the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions comes from the moles of acetate divided by total volume.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ =0.05 L.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since all acetic acid has been neutralized).

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH- can be found using Kb. Since Kb is very small, we can approximate.

Let x be [OH-]. Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 *5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485 → pH = 14 -5.485 = 8.515.

Looking at the options, option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which matches. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let's recalculate the Kb part.

Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

So x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.288e-6 → pOH ≈ 5.485, pH ≈ 8.515. So option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which is correct.

So the second value is 8.52.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00
D) 4.57; 6.92  

So our calculated values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. I have to make sure that the calculations for the equivalence point are correct. Because sometimes, when dealing with strong base and weak acid, the equivalence point is considered as the point where all the acid is neutralized, and the solution is of the conjugate base. So the calculations should be correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you have a strong base titrating a weak acid, the equivalence point is in the basic region, so pH>7. So option A's second value of 8.52 makes sense.

So the correct option should be A.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid remain constant at \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \) (calculated as \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} \)).

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) \approx 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \).

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion (a weak base) is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.08 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \). Comparing with the options:

- **A)** 4.26; 8.52  
- **B)** 3.17; 6.73  
- **C)** 4.73; 7.00  
- **D)** 4.57; 6.92  

The correct answer is **A**.
