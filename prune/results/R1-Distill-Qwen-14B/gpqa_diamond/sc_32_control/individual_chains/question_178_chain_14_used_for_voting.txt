Okay, so I have this Lagrangian to analyze. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants is important for determining renormalizability.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. So the σ tensor is antisymmetric because it's a commutator. 

I think the first step is to figure out the mass dimensions of each field and the coupling κ. Let me recall the standard mass dimensions. In 4 dimensions (since the question probably assumes 4D spacetime), the fields have specific dimensions. Spinor fields like ψ have mass dimension 3/2 each. Because, in 4D, the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian (which has dimensions of [mass]^4) must be dimensionless when multiplied by the integration measure d^4x (which has [mass]^-4). So the Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait. The Lagrangian density has dimensions of [mass]^4, because when you integrate it over d^4x ([mass]^-4), the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have [mass]^4 dimensions.

So for L = terms, each term must have dimension 4.

In the term given, L_int is a term with the fields and κ. Let's write each part out.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

So let's find the dimensions of each factor.

First, ψ̄ψ is a scalar, and each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ has dimension 3.

But wait, σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor. Since it's made from [γ matrices], which are dimensionless (I think), because γ matrices are just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Wait, but F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, like electromagnetism. For electromagnetism, A_mu has dimension 1, because F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For the field strength tensor F^{μν}, in QED, it's built from the gauge field A, which has dimension 1. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So F_{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each term is [∂][A], which is 1 +1 =2. So F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, but σ_{μν} is a tensor, so when you contract it with F^{μν}, you get a scalar. So the whole term is (κ) * (ψ̄ ψ) * (F^{μν} σ_{μν}) ?

Wait, no, the structure is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{μν}. Let me think about the indices. σ_{μν} is antisymmetric, and F^{μν} is also antisymmetric. So when you contract them, you get a scalar. The contraction would look like σ_{μν} F^{μν}.

So the term is κ multiplied by [ψ̄ ψ] multiplied by [σ_{μν} F^{μν}] ?

Wait no, ψ̄ is a spinor, so ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be a spinor bilinear, which transforms as a tensor under Lorentz transformations. So the term is a Lorentz scalar because it's ψ̄ σ F, which should be a scalar.

So each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3.

But wait, σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, so when you have ψ̄ σ ψ, that would be a tensor of rank 2, but in the term, it's multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which is a rank 2 antisymmetric tensor. So the product σ_{μν} F^{μν} would be a scalar.

So the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F^{μν} ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is a tensor, but then multiplied by F^{μν}, so the contraction makes it a scalar.

But to find the dimension, I think I should compute the dimensions of each component.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the mass dimension of each part of the term. Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, each term in it must as well.

So the term is L = κ * [ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ] * [F^{mu nu}] ?

Wait, no. Wait, the term is written as κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So each part's dimension: 

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ same. σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless (since it's made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, and derivatives are dimension 1, but wait, no—gamma matrices are just matrices, so σ is a product of gammas and their commutators. So σ is dimensionless.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2, as discussed earlier.

So the term inside: ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) =3. Then F^{mu nu} is dimension 2.

So ψ̄ σ ψ F^{mu nu} would have dimension 3 + 2 =5?

Wait, but that can't be right, because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the product would be κ * [something of dimension 5], which would require κ to have dimension -1, so that (-1 +5) =4, making the term dimension 4.

Wait, because the Lagrangian term is κ (something with dim5), so [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1.

So [κ]_M = -1.

But wait, let me double-check. The term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * (F^{mu nu}).

Wait, no, perhaps I should count all the fields in the term. Let me write the term as:

κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Each field's dimension:

ψ̄: 3/2

σ_{μν}: dimensionless, because it's a commutator of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ is dimensionless.

ψ: 3/2

F^{mu nu}: dimension 2.

So the product is:

(3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =5.

So the term is κ multiplied by a quantity with dimension 5. So to make the term have dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1.

So [κ]_M = -1. That points towards options A or C.

Now, is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling. For a theory to be renormalizable in 4 dimensions, the coupling constant must have a mass dimension ≤ 0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the general rule is that the coupling constant must have a dimension ≤ 4 - the sum of the fields' dimensions in each term. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, for renormalizability in 4 dimensions, the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0. Or wait, another approach: The interaction term has to have dimension ≤4, because the action is dimensionless.

But more accurately, in a renormalizable theory, all interaction terms in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension ≤4. Because, if a term has a higher dimension, it would require an infinite number of terms for a cutoff, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, the mass dimension of the coupling tells us about renormalizability. For a term in the Lagrangian, the dimension is [mass]^d, and for renormalizability, d must be ≥0. Or wait, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0.

Wait, let me think again. The general condition is that a coupling with a negative mass dimension makes the term in the Lagrangian non-renormalizable because higher order terms (with higher powers of the coupling) would introduce higher powers of the energy scale, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling κ is [κ]_M = -1. Since this is negative, the theory would have non-renormalizable interactions. Because each time you have a term with κ, it's like having a higher power when you have higher loops or higher orders, leading to terms that require infinite renormalization.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: For a term like g φ^3 in the Lagrangian, in 4D, φ has dimension 1, so the term is g φ^3 which would have dimensions [g] + 3*(1) = 4. So [g]_M =1. Since it's positive, the term has a positive dimension, which is okay for renormalizability. Wait, no, wait. Another approach: The term g φ^n has the dimension [g] + n*(dimension of φ) =4. So for the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0, because [g] =4 -n*(dim φ). Since dim φ = (d), which in 4D for a scalar is 1. So [g] =4 -n*1. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] ≥0 → n ≤4.

So, in our problem, the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is [κ]_M = -1. So the interaction term is non-renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension. Because each time you have an interaction, it's multiplied by higher powers of the energy, leading to more divergences that can't be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4. The coupling κ has a dimension of -1, and the rest (ψ̄ σ ψ F) is dimension 5, so 4 = [κ] +5 → [κ]=-1.

But for renormalizability, the coupling must have a non-negative mass dimension. Because in the loop expansions, higher loops would involve higher powers of the coupling. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, each loop would bring in an extra factor of some scale (like Λ), leading to worse divergences that can't be handled by a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory becomes non-renormalizable.

So in our case, κ has dimension -1 <0, so the theory is not renormalizable. Thus, the options are C or A.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable.

So according to this, the correct choice is C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, what's the interaction term here? The term is dimension 4, and the coupling has dimension -1. So each vertex would contribute a factor of κ, which is dimension -1. But when you have loops, each loop brings in a momentum integral, which in 4D would typically contribute a logarithmic divergence, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated.

The superficial degree of divergence D for a diagram is given by D =4 - (1/2) (sum of the fields' dimensions). Wait, each propagator contributes a certain dimension. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula D = 4 - (number of vertices) * (coupling dimension) - (sum over internal lines) * (something).

Alternatively, for a Feynman diagram with V vertices, each vertex contributes a factor of κ. Each vertex has certain fields attached. In our term, each vertex has two ψ lines and two F lines (since L_int is κ ψ̄ σ F). Wait, wait, in the term, it's ψ̄ σ F, which would imply that each vertex connects two ψ lines and two F lines. Hmm, but F is a field strength tensor, which in the case of electromagnetism would correspond to photons. But in this case, perhaps F is a field of some other gauge theory. Wait, in any case, each vertex in the Feynman diagram would have two ψ lines and two F lines.

Each ψ propagator has dimension 3/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence can be computed as D=4L - (I think it's more involved. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula from the renormalization conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach: if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. Because each vertex brings in a negative dimension, and as you go to higher orders (more vertices), the overall dimension becomes even more negative, leading to nonrenormalizable terms.

So with [κ]=-1, each vertex contributes a factor of κ which is [mass]^(-1). So each vertex makes the term go as [mass]^(-1). Therefore, the theory's interaction terms would have higher powers of 1/Λ, leading to effective theories that only make sense below a certain cutoff Λ.

So the theory is non-renormalizable.

So the mass dimension is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option is C: [κ]_M=-1, theory not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
In 4-dimensional spacetime:
- The spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$ (as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has dimension $1$).
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is dimensionless because it is constructed from the dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices.

### Step 2: Mass Dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension $4$ to match the dimensions of the Lagrangian density. Breaking it down:
- $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has dimension $3$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $2$.
- The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ therefore has dimension $3 + 2 = 5$.
- To ensure the entire term has dimension $4$, $\kappa$ must have dimension $4 - 5 = -1$. Thus, $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable in 4 dimensions if the mass dimension of the coupling constant is non-negative ($[\kappa]_M \geq 0$). This ensures that the interaction terms do not introduce divergences that require an infinite number of counterterms. In this case, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This indicates that the theory is **not renormalizable**, as the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
