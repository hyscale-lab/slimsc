Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through what I remember.

So the setup is a light beam going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving. How does that affect things?

I think this has something to do with special relativity. Because when the medium is moving, you can't just add velocities linearly like in classical mechanics. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play here.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light inside the glass has a speed of c/n relative to the glass.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no. No, wait. The speed of light in the medium is indeed c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. So when the medium is moving, we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

So, let's think about the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion, so from the lab's perspective, the light's speed isn't just c/n plus v, because that would be the case in classical mechanics, but relativity says that's not correct.

Einstein's velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, no, because in this case, the light's speed in the medium's frame is u = c/n. But wait, in the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n, but in the lab frame, the medium is moving at velocity v. Hmm, but wait, from the medium's frame, the lab is moving at -v.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the medium's frame, the lab is moving at -v. But in the medium's frame, the speed of light is c/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the medium, we need to apply the velocity transformation.

Wait, according to the velocity addition formula, if an object has velocity u' in the medium's frame, then in the lab frame it's (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

But wait, wait. Oh right, actually, if the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, then the velocity of the light in the lab frame is given by (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)), but u' is the velocity of the light in the medium's frame. So u' is c/n, but wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, in the medium's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. So u' is c/n, but in which direction? Hmm.

Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion. So the medium is moving at velocity v toward the observer, so in the lab frame, the light is moving in the positive direction, same as v. In the medium's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the medium's motion.

So applying the transformation, the lab's speed is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

Plugging in u' = c/n:

Speed = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c)

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v)/n

Denominator: (n c + v)/ (n c) )? Wait, let me see. Wait, denominator is 1 + (v/(n c)) = (n c + v)/(n c)

So the overall speed is [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify:

= (c + n v) * n c / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

Wait, wait, that's (c + n v) * n c / [n (n c + v) ) ]

The n in numerator and denominator cancels:

= (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, but that seems a bit messy. Let me think about this again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Let me double-check. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v) / c² )

Wait, no, no. Wait, the formula is when you have a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to frame S. If an object has velocity u' in S', then in S, it's u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

So in this case, the medium is S', moving at velocity v in S (the lab). The light in the medium's frame has u' = c/n (since it's the speed of light in the medium, moving in the same direction as v).

Wait, but wait. Wait, in the medium's frame, the light is moving at c/n. But wait, when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is not simply additive. So applying the formula, the lab frame speed u is [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v c) / (n c² ) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which equals [ (c + n v ) /n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in numerator and denominator cancels, so:

= (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, but the options don't seem to match that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but in the calculation, the numerator is (c + n v) * c, and denominator is (n c + v). So perhaps I can factor c out.

Wait, let's write it as:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ n c + v ]

Hmm. Let me factor c from the denominator:

Denominator: c (n) + v = c n + v. So, we can factor c as c (n + v/(c) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the terms.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about possible simplifications.

Wait, perhaps if n is 1 (vacuum), but that's not the case here because the medium is glass. Wait, but let me try substituting n=1 and see what happens. If the glass is just moving at v, what's the speed of light?

Wait, if n=1, the speed in the medium is c. So according to the formula I derived, u = [ c + v ] / [1 + ( v c )/(c^2 ) ] = (c + v) / (1 + v/c )

Multiplying numerator and denominator by c:

= (c(c + v)) / (c + v ) ) = c. 

Which makes sense, because in vacuum, light's speed should be c regardless of the medium's motion. So my formula gives u = c when n=1, which is correct.

But looking back at the options, none of them have a factor c. Because in the problem, c is taken as 1. Oh wait, wait, the problem says c=1. So all the terms are in units where c=1, so I don't have to worry about the actual value of c, just treat it as 1.

So let me re-do the calculation with c=1.

So, u' (speed in medium) = 1/n.

The velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v ) / (1 + u' v )

Because when c=1, the denominator becomes 1 + (u' v)

So substituting u' = 1/n:

u = ( (1/n ) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n ) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate fractions:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second, in the problem statement, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is in the same direction as the glass. So the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer. So the light is catching up with the medium. Hmm, but in any case, the analysis holds.

Wait, but wait another thing. The formula I used is correct when the velocity u' is in the same direction as v. Because the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity. So the velocities are additive in the same direction.

But let's consider the case where the medium is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction. So when we apply the transformation, we get u = (u' + v )/(1 + (u' v )/c² )

Wait, but with c=1, that's (u' + v )/(1 + u' v )

Which gives exactly (1 + n v )/(n + v ), which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the moving glass medium relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in the medium (glass) is given as \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \) in this problem). The medium itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:

- **Option B (\( 1 \))**: Incorrect, as this would imply the speed of light is always \( 1 \), regardless of the medium or its motion.
- **Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \))**: Incorrect, as the denominator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- **Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \))**: Incorrect, as the numerator does not match the derived expression.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\text{Answer: A}
\]
