Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving different substances. I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. 

First, I'll try to break down each reaction and identify the possible compounds involved. Let's list out what each reaction says.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let's start with reaction 4 because it might help identify what D and B are. D and B form H in a 1:1 ratio, and H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc., but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Strong acids like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak acids like CH3COOH, H2CO3. So when C reacts with water, maybe it's undergoing hydrolysis. 

Wait, if C is reacting with water to form A and two acids, perhaps C is a salt. Because when a salt reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into its constituent ions. For example, a nitrate salt might not hydrolyze much, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a complex compound. 

Let me think about the possible reactions. Suppose A is a metal. Let's say A is a metal like Fe, Cu, or something else. If A reacts with a gas, B, perhaps B is Cl2, O2, or another diatomic gas. 

The first reaction: A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (gas) to form C. 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe B is Cl2 because 8 equivalents could mean 8 moles per mole of A. For example, if A is Fe, Fe + Cl2 might form FeCl4 (but wait, iron usually forms FeCl2 or FeCl3, not FeCl4). Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a higher oxidation state. 

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium (Na). If B is Cl2, 8 equivalents would be Na + 4 Cl2 → NaCl. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na. That seems unlikely because Na typically has a +1 charge, so 4 Cl2 would give 8 Cl- (since each Cl2 gives 2). So Na would react with Cl2 to form NaCl. But Na has a valency of 1, so maybe 4 Cl2 would give 8 Cl- ions, which would pair with 8 Na+ ions. So 8 Na + Cl2 → 4 NaCl? Wait, no: 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would produce 8 moles of Cl2, which would react with Na in a 2:1 ratio. So 8 moles Cl2 would require 4 moles Na to produce 8 moles NaCl. Wait, but the reaction says 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) per mole A. So if A is Na, and B is Cl2, then 1 mole Na reacts with 4 moles Cl2? That would give NaCl, but that's 1:1 ratio. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with chlorine gas. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So 3 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of Al. But the first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B, which would mean 8 moles of B per mole of A. So if B is Cl2, then 8 moles Cl2 per mole A. Let me see: 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. If I have 8 Cl2, perhaps it's for more than one product or a different reaction, like forming a different chloride.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is oxygen gas (O2). If A is a metal, like Fe, reacting with O2 to form FeO or Fe3O4. But Fe3O4 would require (3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4). So 2 equivalents of O2 per mole of Fe3O4. Not sure if that fits 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with oxygen to form SO3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red solids are not so common. Maybe it's a compound with a lot of unpaired electrons, like a transition metal complex. Or maybe it's a compound with a particular color. For instance, CuO is black, Fe2O3 is reddish, but maybe C is a different compound.

Alternatively, think about the first reaction. A solid (A) + 8 equivalents of gas B → C (bright red). Let me think of some reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio.

Wait, another approach: The second reaction involves C reacting with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. Let me think of some dangerous compounds. For example, HCN is very toxic, but I don't know if that's relevant. Another possibility is phosgene, but that's a gas.

Wait, let's think about C reacting with D to form E. If E is a highly hazardous product, perhaps it's a cyanide or something like that. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive gas like NO or something else.

Wait, but another approach: look at reaction 3, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. Since F is strong acid and G is weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that contains both strong and weak acid anions. For example, if C is NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- (which is a weak acid, so HSO4^- can act as an acid, releasing H+ and SO4^2-). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, when it reacts with water, it would form Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But NO3^- isn't an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. Let me think. If C is NaHSO4, then it's sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^-. HSO4^- can act as an acid (strong) because H2SO4 is a strong acid. Then, when HSO4^- is in water, it might dissociate further into H+ and SO4^2-? But that's more for strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of anions. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't do much, but if it's a more reactive salt, it might hydrolyze. But I'm not seeing how that would produce two acids.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, reacting a metal with sulfur to form a sulfide. But when sulfides react with water, they typically produce H2S and metal hydroxide. But H2S is a weak acid, but perhaps in this case, F is H2S (weak acid) and G is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's think about when C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So, perhaps C is a salt that contains both nitrate (NO3^-) and chloride (Cl^-) ions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider the fourth reaction. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D + B → H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include H2O, ethanol, acetone, etc. If D and B are both gases, maybe they combine to form something like HCl (which is a gas but not exactly a solvent). Wait, no, HCl is a gas but not a solvent.

Wait, another thought: D and B form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H could be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, B could be O2 and D is H2, forming H2O. Oh, wait! H2O is a solvent. So B is O2, D is H2, and they form H2O as H. That makes sense.

So, in reaction 4: D (H2) + B (O2) → H2O (H). So H is H2O.

If that's the case, then B is O2, D is H2.

Let me check if this makes sense elsewhere. Reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 (B) to form C (bright red). What could that be?

A is solid, reacting with O2 to form C. Let's think of metals reacting with O2 to form metal oxides. But the product is bright red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but maybe a different compound.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur is a solid. Reacting with O2 would form SO3? But SO3 is a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, when sulfur is burned in excess O2, it forms SO2 (a gas), but that's colorless. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: Maybe A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Chromium(III) oxide is green, iron(III) oxide is reddish. But is it bright red? Maybe copper(II) oxide is black, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like CuO, but that's black. Alternatively, maybe C is a complex. Wait, another possibility: if A is sodium (Na) and B is O2, then 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of Na. That would be a lot. The reaction would be 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. So sodium peroxide. Then C would be Na2O2, which is a bright orange-yellow solid, I think. But the question says bright red. Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. But Al2O3 is white. So maybe not.

Wait, another angle. If B is O2, then in reaction 1, A plus 8 O2 gives C. Maybe A is a metal that forms a higher oxide. For example, perhaps A is Fe, and C is FeO4^2- or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is phosphorus. White phosphorus reacts with O2 to form P4O10, which is a white solid. Doesn't fit the bright red description.

Wait, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a bright red oxide. For example, manganese(IV) oxide is dark brown, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is copper. Reacting with O2 forms CuO, which is black. Not red.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C must be a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids. So perhaps C is a sulfite or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixed salt.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into 2 NaOH (strong base, but not an acid) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But the question says F and G are acids, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: if C is sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7), which is orange-red in color. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and Cr2O7^2- (which is a strong oxidizing agent, but perhaps in solution, it can hydrolyze. But I'm not sure if that would produce two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and sulfate salt, but that's unclear.

Wait, let's think about the fourth reaction more. If H is H2O, then D is H2 and B is O2. So reaction 4: H2 + O2 → H2O (with catalyst, perhaps). So D is H2, B is O2.

Now, reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with O2 (8 eq) to form C (bright red). Let me think of a reaction where a solid metal reacts with O2 in a high molar ratio. For example, sodium reacting with O2 to form NaO2? Wait, sodium superoxide is NaO2, which is a bright yellow solid. Not red.

Wait, another possibility: A is sulfur. Sulfur (solid) + O2 → SO3 (but that's a gas, not solid). Or perhaps, when sulfur is burned in excess oxygen, it forms SO2, which is a gas. But C is a product, so it should be a solid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a peroxide. For example, calcium peroxide is CaO2, which is white. Not red.

Alternatively, perhaps the product C is a mixed oxide. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the product C contains a transition metal in a high oxidation state. For example, potassium dichromate is orange-red. So if C is K2Cr2O7, which is orange-red, perhaps that fits the bright red description. Then, in reaction 1, A could be Cr metal reacting with O2 to form Cr2O7^2-.

Wait, but how would that happen? Chromium metal typically forms Cr2O3 when oxidized, which is dark green. To get K2Cr2O7, perhaps it's made from a reaction where chromium is oxidized in a basic solution. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 1 is the formation of a chromate. Let me think: if A is Na and B is O2, then reaction 1 could form Na2O2, which is a bright yellow solid. But that's not red. So this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound. KMnO4 is purple, not red. Maybe another compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. But earlier thoughts didn't fit.

Wait, perhaps reaction 3 can give more clues. C gives A, F, and G upon hydrolysis. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives a strong acid (like HCl) and a weak acid (like H2SO3 or H3PO4).

Wait, another idea: if C is ammonium nitrate. NH4NO3 is a white solid. When it reacts with water, it dissolves and might hydrolyze, but I'm not sure if it produces two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate and sulfate salt. But I'm not certain.

Wait, going back. Let me summarize what I have so far:

- Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), which is H2O. So D is H2, B is O2.

Thus, in reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red).

I need to find a reaction where a solid reacts with O2 in 8 equivalents to form a bright red solid.

Wait, 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of A. For a metal, each mole of metal typically reacts with a certain number of O2 molecules. Let's think about the formula.

Assume the formula of C is MO_x. The number of O2 depends on the valency of the metal and the oxidation state.

If A is a metal M, and the reaction is M + O2 → MO_x.

The number of O2 molecules per mole of M is (x/2), since each O2 provides two O atoms.

In reaction 1, 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of A. So, (x/2) = 8 → x = 16. So each M would have 16 O atoms. That seems like a lot. What compound has 16 O atoms per metal atom?

Wait, that's not likely. Perhaps the formula is MO4^something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M2O16, but that's less common.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, in the case of manganese, MnO4^− is a common ion. But that's part of a salt, not a pure metal oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex oxide. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: What is a bright red solid that's a product of a metal reacting with oxygen? One possibility is lead dioxide, PbO2, which is dark brown. Another is mercury(II,II) oxide, HgO, which is red. Oh! HgO is a bright red solid. So if A is mercury metal (Hg), and it reacts with O2 to form HgO.

So, Hg (solid) + O2 → HgO (bright red). But what's the stoichiometry?

The reaction for the formation of mercuric oxide is 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of Hg. So per mole of Hg, 0.5 moles of O2 are used. But reaction 1 says 8 equivalents of B (O2) per mole of A (Hg). So that's 8 moles O2 per mole Hg. But the actual reaction uses 0.5 moles O2 per mole Hg. So this doesn't fit. So maybe A isn't Hg.

Wait, another bright red solid: maybe it's a sulfide. But that doesn't involve O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a permanganate ion. KMnO4 is purple, but maybe a different compound. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(VI) compounds are often orange or yellow. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange-red. So if C is K2Cr2O7, which is a bright red solid, perhaps that's the case.

Then, reaction 1 would be A (a chromium compound?) reacting with O2 to form K2Cr2O7. But that's not making much sense because K2Cr2O7 is a salt, not a product of a metal and O2.

Wait, perhaps A is a chromium ore, like Cr2O3. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium chromate, Na2CrO4. But that's a solid, and reacting with O2 doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck on this part. Let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces two different acids.

If C is a sulfite, say Na2SO3, it would hydrolyze into NaOH and H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid. Then F would be NaOH (strong base, not acid) so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate in the same salt. For example, maybe (NH4)2SO4·... No, not sure.

Wait, another thought: C could be a mixed salt like NaHSO4·... Wait, NaHSO4 is sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^-.

HSO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to form H+ and SO4^2-.

But in water, does HSO4^- fully dissociate? For strong acids, yes, but HSO4^- is a weak acid (since the first dissociation of H2SO4 is strong, but the second is weak). So when NaHSO4 reacts with water, it would produce H+ (from HSO4^-) and SO4^2-.

Wait, but the reaction says C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So perhaps C is NaHSO4, which in water forms Na+ (A?), H+ (F?), and SO4^2- (G?), but that doesn't fit the two acids part. Alternatively, maybe C is a combination of two salts.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate, but that's getting too speculative.

Wait, perhaps C is ammonium sulfate. (NH4)2SO4 is a white solid. Upon hydrolysis, it would produce NH4OH (a weak acid, ammonium hydroxide, which is basic, not acidic) and H2SO4 (strong acid). So F would be H2SO4 and G would be NH4OH, but NH4OH is a weak base, not an acid. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe C is a mixture of salts that, upon hydrolysis, produce two acids. Like a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, sodium salt of a diprotic acid. Let's say H2A is a diprotic acid, where the first dissociation is strong (so HA^- is a weak acid). So if C is NaHA, which upon hydrolysis would produce NaOH (strong base, but not an acid) and HA^- (weak acid). Not matching F and G as acids.

Alternatively, if C is a salt of two different acids. For example, a salt like NaHSO3·NaHCO3? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. Like CaCO3. But when it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much. Unless it's a more reactive carbonate. Wait, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). So in this case, F would be H2CO3 (weak acid), G would be NaOH (strong base, not acid). Doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is calcium bisulfate, Ca(HSO4)2. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can act as an acid, so it would produce H+ and SO4^2-.

So perhaps F is H+ (from HSO4^-) which is a strong acid, and G is something else. Wait, but H+ comes from the dissociation of HSO4^-, which is a weak acid. So maybe F is H2SO4 (strong acid) if the HSO4^- further dissociates. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. For example, if C is NaCl and NaHSO4, but that doesn't make sense in terms of the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But NO3^- is a weak acid (it's a conjugate base of HNO3, which is strong). So NO3^- in water can hydrolyze to form HNO3 (strong acid) and OH^- (from the hydrolysis reaction: NO3^- + H2O ↔ HNO3 + OH^-). So in this case, F would be HNO3 (strong acid) and G would be OH^- (which is basic, but perhaps not an acid). So that's not matching the two acids F and G.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me think of another angle. If C is a sulfonamide or something else, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, but when FeS reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze. It would react with water and oxygen to form Fe(OH)3 and H2S, but H2S is a weak acid. But that's a more involved reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH reacts with water to form NaOH and H2. But again, that's a base and a gas, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. But H2O2 is a liquid, and it's not a solid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate of a transition metal. For example, CuSO4·5H2O is blue, but when it reacts with water, it might not produce acids.

Another approach: Let's think about reaction 2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (which we've deduced is H2) to form E, a highly hazardous product.

Wait, C reacts with H2 (D) to form E. If C is a metal oxide, like FeO, reacting with H2 would be a reduction. For example, FeO + H2 → Fe + H2O. But that's a simple reduction, and E would be metallic iron, which isn't extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Si3N4, reacting with H2 would produce NH3 and SiH4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: If C is a chromium compound, like K2Cr2O7 (which is orange-red), and it reacts with H2. Hmm, but H2 is a reducing agent. So perhaps in reaction 2, C is being reduced. For example, K2Cr2O7 (strong oxidizing agent) reacting with H2 could produce Cr metal or another chromium compound. But I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, like CuSO4, and reacting with H2 could produce Cu and H2SO4. But that's a simple displacement reaction, and H2SO4 is a strong acid. But in reaction 2, E is the product, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a dichromate, like K2Cr2O7, and D is H2, the reaction might produce Cr metal and other products. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 2 is a hydrogenolysis reaction. For example, if C is a nitro compound, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonic acid, but that's probably not relevant here.

I'm getting stuck on identifying C. Maybe I should try to think about reaction 3 again.

C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

If F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), then C must be a sulfate and carbonate salt? Or perhaps a bisulfate and bicarbonate? This is getting too vague.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, NaHSO4 (bisulfate) and NaHCO3 (bicarbonate). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. For example, if C is NaHSO4·NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it would form NaOH (strong base, not acid), H2SO4 (strong acid), and H2CO3 (weak acid). But that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid, like NaHSO4. Then, when it hydrolyzes, it would produce NaOH (strong base) and H2SO4 (strong acid). But that would give one acid and one base, not two acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the overall picture. Reaction 3 is producing two acids, F and G, when C reacts with water. So C must be a salt that contains two different anions, each of which can hydrolyze to form an acid. For example, if C is a mixture of sulfate and bicarbonate, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, which upon hydrolysis can produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and another acid. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: C could be a hydrate. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex salt. For example, if C is a double salt like Na2S2O3 (sodium sulfite?), but I'm not certain.

Another thought: Maybe F is HNO3 (strong acid) and G is H2CO3 (weak acid), so C must be a nitrate and carbonate salt. For example, NaNO3·Na2CO3. But when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into NaNO3 and Na2CO3, which would hydrolyze into HNO3 and H2CO3. But that's speculative.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the possible structure of E, which is the product of reaction 2. C reacts with H2 (D) to form E, a dangerous product.

If E is a highly dangerous gas, perhaps it's HCN (hydrogen cyanide), but that would require C to be a cyanide source. Alternatively, if E is CO (carbon monoxide), but that's a possibility if C is a metal oxide like CuO reacting with H2 to form Cu and H2O. But that's not dangerous enough. Alternatively, E could be phosgene, but that would require C to be a chlorinated compound.

Wait, another idea: If C is a nitride, like Si3N4, and D is H2, the reaction could produce NH3 and SiH4. NH3 is toxic, but I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, like Fe3O4, reacting with H2 might produce Fe and H2O. Not dangerous.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. Reacting with H2 would produce something, but H2O2 is already a peroxide. Maybe it's a decomposition reaction, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

We have to find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are symmetry groups. So E must have a certain molecular geometry that corresponds to one of these groups.

I think D∞h is the symmetry group for a linear molecule with multiple atoms, like CO2 (which is linear, but CO2 has D∞h symmetry). Wait, but CO2 has D∞h symmetry, yes. O3 (ozone) has C2v symmetry, I think. H2O has C2v symmetry. HCN is linear, so D∞h. CH4 is Td symmetry.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule with a center of symmetry, it would have D∞h. For example, HCN, CO, NO, etc.

If E is a trigonal planar molecule, maybe it's C2v. Ozone is trigonal planar and has C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like H2O, it has C2v symmetry.

So, the question is, what is the structure of E that would give it one of these symmetry groups.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group would likely be D∞h or C2 (if it's linear but without a center of inversion). Wait, no, C2 is a rotation axis. D∞h includes a rotation axis and other elements.

But without knowing what E is, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should try to figure out what E is.

Let me try to recap. From reaction 4, H is H2O, so B is O2 and D is H2.

Reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C (bright red). Let's think of a reaction where a metal reacts with O2 in a high ratio to form a red solid.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps A is a metal that forms a dioxide. For example, lead forms PbO2, lead dioxide, which is dark brown. Not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is manganese, and C is manganese(IV) oxide, MnO2, which is black. Not red.

Wait, wait. Maybe C is a sulfide. Let me think. If C is CuS, which is black, but if it's a different sulfide. Alternatively, perhaps C is As2S3, which is red. But As2S3 is a solid, and it's red. But how would that form from a metal reacting with O2? Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a chromate or dichromate. K2Cr2O7 is orange-red. So if C is K2Cr2O7, which is a bright red/orange solid.

Then, reaction 1 would be A (solid) + 8 O2 → K2Cr2O7 (C).

But how does that happen? K2Cr2O7 is a salt, so perhaps A is K2Cr2O7 itself, but that can't be since it's being formed.

Wait, perhaps A is chromium metal. Let's think: Chromium metal (Cr) reacting with O2 to form Cr2O7^2- (dichromate). But chromium metal reacts with oxygen to form CrO3, which is dark brown, I think. Not red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a chromium compound that when oxidized forms K2Cr2O7. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a sodium chromate solution. No, A is a solid.

Wait, perhaps reaction 1 is the oxidation of a metal to form a dichromate. For example, sodium chromate (Na2CrO4) can be oxidized to sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7). But that would require strong acidic conditions and a strong oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a chromium ore, and the reaction forms K2Cr2O7. But that's speculative.

Ok, perhaps I should focus on reaction 3. C (which is K2Cr2O7) reacts with water to form A, F, and G.

So, K2Cr2O7 + H2O → ?

Hydrolysis of K2Cr2O7 in water is known to produce H2SO4 and K2CrO4. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Or perhaps it produces different products.

Wait, the reaction of K2Cr2O7 with water is:

K2Cr2O7 → 2 K+ + Cr2O7^2-.

In acidic solution, Cr2O7^2- can act as a strong oxidizing agent, but in neutral or basic conditions, it might hydrolyze further.

Alternatively, perhaps when K2Cr2O7 is heated in water, it can decompose. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis of K2Cr2O7 in water produces H2Cr2O7 (which is a strong acid, H2SO4-like) and K2CrO4 (a weak acid, since HCrO4 is a weak acid). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about this.

Wait, if C is K2Cr2O7, then reaction 3 would produce K2CrO4 (A?), H2SO4 (F, strong acid), and something else? Not sure. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Another approach: Perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. When it hydrolyzes, it gives a strong acid (like H2SO4) and a weak acid (like a carboxylic acid). But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like NaHSO4·NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into NaHSO4 and NaHCO3, which would further hydrolyze into H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2CO3 (weak acid). So F is H2SO4 and G is H2CO3. Then, A would be Na2SO4 and Na2CO3? Or perhaps A is NaCl or another salt.

Hmm. But I'm not sure if such a mixed salt exists.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a carbonate, like NaNO3·Na2CO3. When reacted with water, it would produce HNO3 and H2CO3. But again, I'm not sure about the practicality of such a salt.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonic acid. For example, benzene sulfonic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid, like NH4NO3. When NH4NO3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NH4OH (weak base) and HNO3 (strong acid). So F would be HNO3 (strong acid) and G would be NH4OH (which is a base, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Let me try to think of what E could be.

If E is a product of C reacting with H2, and it's extremely hazardous, perhaps E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide). So how would that form?

HCN is formed from the reaction of CN^- with H+. But if C contains cyanide ions, and D is H2, perhaps the reaction is:

C (with CN^-) + H2 → HCN + ... ?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile, which upon reaction with H2 could produce an amine, but that's also unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but that would require C to have Cl and O groups.

Wait, another idea: If C is a nitro compound, like KNO3. Then, reaction with H2 could produce NO and H2O, but I'm not sure if that's dangerous enough.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl is a toxic liquid. But I'm not sure if that's formed from C reacting with H2.

Wait, perhaps E is a carbonyl compound, like CO. But CO is a gas, and it's toxic. So if C is a metal oxide and D is H2, the reaction could produce CO.

For example, reaction of CuO with H2:

CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O.

But that doesn't produce CO. Alternatively, perhaps C is a higher oxide, like Fe3O4.

Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe + H2O. Again, no CO.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about what E is, and then work backward.

If E has C2v symmetry, it's likely a bent molecule with a certain structure. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry. So if E is O3, what would the reactions look like?

But how would O3 form? It's formed by the reaction of O2 with something. Alternatively, O3 is formed from the decomposition of certain compounds.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like H2O2, which is bent, it has C2v symmetry. Wait, H2O2 has a structure where the two O-H groups are on one side, making it a bent molecule with a central O-O bond. So its symmetry group is C2v.

But how would H2O2 form from C and D (H2)?

If C is an oxide and D is H2, perhaps the reaction is:

C (oxide) + H2 → E (H2O2) + ... ?

But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is O3, but that's not likely.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCN, which is linear, so D∞h symmetry. HCN has a triple bond between C and N, and it's a linear molecule. Its symmetry group is D∞h.

So if E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → HCN + ... ?

But I'm not sure what C would be in that case. Maybe C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN. Then, reaction with H2 would produce HCN and NaOH. But NaCN is a cyanide salt, and reacting with H2 would require acidic conditions. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonyl, like Ni(CO)4, which upon reaction with H2 would produce CO gas. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure with a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. Its symmetry group is D∞h because it's linear with a center of inversion. So D∞h would be the symmetry group.

So if E is phosgene, its symmetry is D∞h (option C). But how would that form from C and H2?

Phosgene is produced from the reaction of COCl2 with something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with C2 symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: What if E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or H2O. No, O2 is diatomic with D∞h symmetry, and H2O has C2v.

But E is a product of reaction 2, which involves C and D (H2).

Let me try to think differently. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the answer based on the options and the reactions.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule like CO or HCN, it's D∞h. If E is a bent molecule like O3 or H2O, it's C2v.

If E is a square planar molecule, it would be D4h, but I don't think E is square planar.

So, considering E is a highly hazardous product, perhaps it's a gas like CO or HCN, which are linear, so D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which is a bent molecule, it's C2v.

But without knowing E's identity, it's challenging.

Wait, considering reaction 3 again: C reacts with water to produce F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). If F is H2SO4 and G is H2CO3, then C might be a sulfate and carbonate salt. But I'm not making progress.

Another angle: Let's consider the possible symmetry groups for E.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule with a center of inversion. Examples include HCN, CO, NO, etc.

If E has C2v symmetry, it's a bent molecule, like O3, H2O, etc.

If E is a linear molecule, the symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's bent, C2v.

So, the question is, which of these is E.

Let me think about the reactions again.

Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry. How would that happen? C would have to be something that reacts with H2 to form H2O. For example, if C is O2, but O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But in reaction 1, O2 is B, and it's a gas reacting with A to form C. So C wouldn't be O2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like HOOH. But that's not a solid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is an oxide of a metal that, when reduced with H2, produces the metal and water. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But E would be H2O, which is a product, but that's not extremely hazardous. So probably not.

Wait, but the question states that E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is a gas like HCN or phosgene.

If E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry, then C would have to be a cyanide salt, and D is H2. So reaction 2 would be:

Cyanide salt + H2 → HCN + something.

But I'm not sure about the details.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide, like NaCN. Reaction with H2 might not produce HCN unless under acidic conditions. But the reaction uses H2 as D, which is a gas. So perhaps it's a reduction reaction. For example, NaCN + H2 → HCN + Na (but that's speculative).

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrile, like CH3CN. CH3CN is a liquid, not a solid. So that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the information I have.

Given that reaction 3 produces two acids, F and G, when C reacts with water. If F is strong and G is weak, perhaps C is a bisulfate (HSO4^-) and another anion. But I'm not sure.

If E is HCN with D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C: D∞h.

But without knowing for sure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be D: C2v.

But given the options and the reactions, I'm more inclined to think E is a linear molecule, giving D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Since H is a solvent, it is deduced to be H₂O. Therefore, D is H₂ (hydrogen gas) and B is O₂ (oxygen gas).

2. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O₂ to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like sodium dichromate (Na₂Cr₂O₇), which is orange-red, or another red solid. However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to form A, F (a strong acid), and G (a weak acid). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes into two acids. For example, if C were NaHSO₄ (sodium bisulfate), it would hydrolyze into H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and HSO₄⁻ (weak acid). However, the exact nature of C is speculative.

4. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of H₂ to form E, an extremely hazardous product. If E is a linear molecule like HCN (hydrogen cyanide) or CO (carbon monoxide), it would have **D∞h symmetry**. If E is a bent molecule like O₃ (ozone) or H₂O, it would have **C₂v symmetry**. Given the description of E as extremely hazardous, linear molecules like HCN are more likely, as they align with the **D∞h symmetry group**.

5. **Symmetry Groups**: 
   - **C₂**: A simple rotation axis, unlikely for E.
   - **D₄h**: Symmetry of square planar molecules, not applicable here.
   - **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules like HCN or CO, consistent with the hazardous nature of E.
   - **C₂v**: Symmetry of bent molecules like O₃ or H₂O, less likely given the hazardous context.

Based on the analysis, E is most likely a linear molecule with **D∞h symmetry**. 

Answer: C
