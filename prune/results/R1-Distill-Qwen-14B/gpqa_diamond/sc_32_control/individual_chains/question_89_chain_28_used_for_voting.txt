Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's go through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece it together.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. So, each Br would be removed, and a double bond would form between the two carbons where the Brs were attached. Wait, but wait—1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh, wait, no, wait. Actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four bridgehead carbons. The numbering is such that 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgeheads? Wait, no. Wait, in adamantane, each bridge is between two carbons. So, 1 and 3 would be on opposite bridgeheads. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps when KOH is used in excess and heat, it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, that's two bromines on non-adjacent carbons. Wait, no, in adamantane, each bridgehead is a carbon connected to two other bridgeheads. So, 1,3 might not be adjacent. So, if we have two bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane, when KOH is applied, perhaps each Br is removed, and maybe it's a di-elimination? Oh wait, but each elimination would form a double bond. Wait, but two bromines on non-adjacent carbons—so maybe the product would be a diene? Or perhaps the molecule can't form a double bond in that position because of the structure. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think I should look up what 1,3-dibromoadamantane does when treated with KOH. Oh, right, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, but since the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads, the elimination would form a single double bond between those two carbons, resulting in 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination would form a double bond, but since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating each would form a double bond between those two bridgeheads. So the product would be a molecule with a double bond between C1 and C3, making it 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps it's 1,3-dialkene.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an -OCH2CH3 group or something similar. Wait, no, but wait. Alternatively, when dihalides are treated with KOH, another possibility is that it's a substitution reaction. Wait, no, with excess KOH and heat, elimination is more likely. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, and the product is a diene. But the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Another possibility is that the product is a diol, but that would require a substitution reaction. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination rather than substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination. Wait, another thought: maybe the base deprotonates something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a solvolysis, but more likely elimination. So, if the product has a peak at 4.79, maybe it's an ether or an ester? Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, but the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So product 1 has a carbonyl group.

Wait, but if the initial reaction is elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene, but then what's with the carbonyl? Maybe I'm getting the first reaction wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, could it be a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, because there's no aromatic ring involved. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Perhaps the first reaction is an example of the Hofmann elimination, but that's typically for amides and such. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening. Wait, but adamantane is a very stable structure, so I don't think that's likely. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data. The peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or part of an ether or ester. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably the bridgehead protons in adamantane. So putting this together, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide? No, because the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, the IR of an epoxide has a peak around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretch, which isn't mentioned here. So probably not an epoxide.

Wait, another thought: When dihalides react with KOH, sometimes they form geminal diols if it's a substitution, but that would require two substitutions, which is less likely under such conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl via oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation. But I don't see how in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which would require the loss of two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond, and then some rearrangement. Wait, but how would that form a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The reaction is 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1, which has IR at 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl) and an NMR peak at 4.79 (2H). Maybe the product is 1,3-diketone. But how?

Wait, I think I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form a carbene or some intermediate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think of the first step differently. What's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? It's a molecule where two bridgehead carbons (1 and 3) each have a Br substituent. So, when KOH is added and heated, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but since the two Brs are on non-adjacent bridgeheads, the elimination leads to a ring-opening or formation of a new structure. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, which allows for double elimination to form two double bonds? No, that might not fit with the data.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, but with two OH groups? But then the IR would show an OH stretch, which isn't mentioned. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that would require the two Brs being on the same carbon, which they aren't in 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from an -OCH2- group. How about if product 1 is a ketone with adjacent oxygen atoms? Wait, could it be a cyclic ketone? Or perhaps an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but is a substitution leading to a diol, but that would produce two -OH groups. However, the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3300 cm-1, which is typical for O-H. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide. But then the IR would have the C-O-C peak. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Let me think about the structure. If the two Br atoms are eliminated, perhaps as HBr, and a double bond forms between C1 and C3. But how does that form a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced with an O- group, but that would require more than just KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's an oxidation of a double bond to a ketone, but that would require an oxidizing agent, which KOH isn't providing.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong and the first reaction is a substitution, but under what conditions? KOH is a strong base, but for substitution, maybe it's SN2, but given the structure of adamantane, which is quite rigid, the SN2 is unlikely for bridgehead positions. So substitution is probably not the main pathway.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to proceed assuming that product 1 is a ketone. Suppose product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, the next step is heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. I remember that aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but if product 1 is a diketone, which is a good acylating agent, perhaps the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction would occur. But wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure without aromatic rings. So perhaps it's not Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement or some other pericyclic reaction.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the next step is an alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a Lewis acid catalyst for some kind of alkylation or acylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, but that didn't fit with the IR data. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but that didn't fit either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl chloride, but that would require a reaction with something like PCl5, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first reaction again. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane plus KOH (excess) at 240°C. Another possibility is that it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a double bond, but given that the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps two double bonds are formed, but that might not be feasible due to the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that's substitution, which would be unlikely under these conditions.

Wait, I'm really stuck on the first step. Let me look for another approach. The IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is likely a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or ester. So, maybe product 1 is a diketone, but that doesn't explain the singlet at 4.79 ppm.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the initial reaction is a coupling reaction, but I can't think of any that would fit that scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a substitution with KOH to form a geminal diol, but that's only possible if both Brs are on the same carbon, which they're not.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. But then the NMR wouldn't have a singlet for an oxygen-containing group.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2CH3 group, but why would that form from the reaction? Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetal or something similar.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent methyl group. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is more like the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that doesn't fit with KOH.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the first reaction is a dehydration, but dehydrohalogenation. So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation, perhaps it forms a double bond between the two bridgeheads. But then, how would that lead to a carbonyl group?

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. If I can't figure out the first step, perhaps I should proceed to the second step and see if that helps.

So, product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, but let's think: Product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is facilitating some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but without knowing product 1's structure, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can figure out product 3's structure and work backward.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis tends to break double bonds into carbonyls. So if product 3's NMR has certain coupling patterns, that might indicate the structure.

The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Deshielded protons are usually near electronegative atoms or in a strained environment. For example, in a carbonyl group, the alpha protons are deshielded.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, if the starting material (product 2) had a double bond, the cleavage would produce carbonyl groups. Let's say product 2 had a double bond between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, perhaps ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substituents.

Suppose product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would cleave the diene into fragments. Alternatively, if product 2 has a single double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Now, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, leading to a certain coupling pattern.

In ozonolysis, each end of the double bond is cleaved. For example, if the double bond was in a chain like R1-CH2-CH2-R2, ozonolysis would break it into R1-CHO and R2-CHO (if each R is a single substituent). But in more complex structures, like rings or bridged systems, the products can be more varied.

Wait, but going back to product 2: if product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound, and product 2 is formed by a reaction with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an acylated product.

Alternatively, another thought: Product 1 is a ketone. When treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acetylation or alkylation. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible structures.

Let me try to approach this systematically.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with excess KOH.

If it's a dehydrohalogenation (elimination), each Br would be removed, forming a double bond between C1 and C3. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But then, how does that fit with the IR and NMR data?

But wait, 1,3-adamantadiene would have a structure with two double bonds? Or a single double bond? No, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form a single double bond between C1 and C3, making it 1,3-adamantadiene, which is actually an allene (conjugated diene?) but in a bridged system.

But if that's the case, the product 1 would be an alkene, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong and the product isn't an alkene. Let me think again.

Another possibility: The reaction could be a substitution, but with two Br atoms, perhaps leading to a diol. However, as I thought earlier, the NMR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a diketone. How? Maybe via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination leads to a double bond. But how does that lead to a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone via a rearrangement. Wait, if the dihalide eliminates to form a double bond, and then some rearrangement forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diene, and then some further reaction occurs. No, because the first step is only treated with KOH.

Hmm. I'm stuck, so maybe I should proceed assuming that product 1 is a ketone.

Product 1 is a ketone. Then, when heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, it forms product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts acylation, but since product 1 is a ketone, which is a good acylating agent, perhaps product 2 is the acylated product. But wait, where is the aromatic ring? There isn't one, so perhaps it's being used in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Wait, another possibility: Product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, the Al(OiPr)3 could facilitate a ring-opening. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Then, Al(OiPr)3 could act as a catalyst for some kind of reaction.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the third step: Ozonolysis of product 2, followed by workup with dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive workup, I think). Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 2 is an alkene. So, the second step must form an alkene from product 1.

Product 1 is a carbonyl compound (from IR). So, how does a carbonyl compound become an alkene when treated with Al(OiPr)3.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the reaction forms an alkene via some kind of elimination.

Wait, but Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, perhaps facilitating the formation of a carbocation, which could lose a leaving group to form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and the Al(OiPr)3 is used in a transesterification, but that doesn't form an alkene.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a carbonyl with an adjacent leaving group, Al(OiPr)3 could facilitate an elimination to form a double bond. For example, if product 1 is a vicinal dihalide next to a carbonyl, elimination would form an alkene. But wait, product 1 came from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH, which I thought was elimination, but perhaps not.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

Assuming that product 1 is a di-ketone, perhaps 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps a Friedel-Crafts type reaction occurs, but without an aromatic ring, this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the diketone loses a molecule of water to form a double bond, facilitated by the Lewis acid. So, the diketone might undergo dehydration to form a conjugated diene or an isolated double bond.

Wait, that makes sense. If the diketone (product 1) has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination of water would form a double bond between those carbons, creating an alkene. So, product 2 would be an enedione (a conjugated dienone) or a simple alkene.

But wait, product 1 would have two ketone groups on non-adjacent bridgeheads. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is not a diketone but a single ketone. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could induce an elimination reaction, forming an alkene.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone with a good leaving group adjacent to the carbonyl, then the Lewis acid could facilitate an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a β-hydroxy ketone, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-dihalide, but that would require the two Brs being on the same carbon, which they aren't.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps I should proceed to the ozonolysis step and see what product 3 would look like.

If product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the NMR of product 3 has a certain coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen. Deshielded protons are likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In ozonolysis, the workup (with dimethyl sulfide) usually leads to cleavage into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents on the double bond. So, if product 2's double bond was between two CH2 groups, product 3 would have two aldehyde groups. But that's just one possibility.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH2 next to an oxygen. Alternatively, that could be an acetal or an ether group. But in the ozonolysis product, perhaps that's not present.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diketone, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 forms an enol ether, which then upon ozonolysis would cleave in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let's try to think of the possible product 3.

Suppose product 3 has a structure with two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded protons would be adjacent to these groups. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring protons.

If a CH2 is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, the protons would couple with each other. For example, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the central CH2 groups would have two neighboring Hs each. Wait, but in that case, each CH2 would have coupling with the neighboring CH2. So, each H would be a quartet (if each CH2 is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent carbon). But that's a pentet, which is one of the options.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the structure more carefully.

Suppose product 3 is a dialdehyde: OHC-R-CHO. Then, the protons adjacent to the aldehyde would be deshielded. Each aldehyde proton is deshielded, but they are usually split due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. In such a case, the protons on the CH2 groups adjacent to the ketones would be next to each other. Each H on the first CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2, so each would be a quartet. But wait, if each CH2 is connected to another CH2, the coupling would be between each set. Each proton on the first CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a triplet, depending on the J values.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs in the adjacent CH2. That would make each H a triplet (each split into a triplet by the adjacent two Hs). But if the first CH2 is also next to another group with Hs, perhaps it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with adjacent carbonyl groups, but that's another possibility.

Wait, another approach. The coupling pattern is determined by the number of neighboring non-equivalent protons. So, a triplet would mean two neighboring Hs. A triplet of triplets would mean coupling with two sets of two Hs each, or another scenario. A pentet would be four neighboring Hs, but that's less likely in this case.

Wait, in the ozonolysis product, if the cleavage produces two carbonyl groups with CH2 groups between them, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group's protons would be adjacent to another CH2. So each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H on the first CH2 is also adjacent to the same two Hs on the second CH2, so each would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is next to another group with Hs, maybe the coupling is more complex.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. So, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be next to two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2's Hs would be next to each other. So, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the second CH2, making them a triplet. Similarly, the second CH2's Hs would also be triplets.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be more deshielded. So, those Hs would be in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group.

So, for those Hs, each is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each would be a triplet.

Therefore, the most deshielded H would be a triplet. So the answer would be option A) triplet.

But wait, let me think again. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 is next to another CH2. The coupling would be between the two CH2 groups. Each CH2's protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if there's another group adjacent, perhaps it's more complex.

Another possibility: if the ozonolysis product has a CH2 group with adjacent Hs on both sides, like O=C-CH2-CH2-O-. Wait, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a single carbonyl with a CH2-CH2 chain, leading to each CH2's Hs being split by the adjacent CH2.

In any case, based on my reasoning, the most deshielded H would be a triplet, so the answer is A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH**  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, possibly oxygen.  
   - Based on the reaction conditions and data, product 1 is likely a diketone, such as 1,3-diketone adamantane.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃) is a Lewis acid often used to catalyze eliminations or rearrangements.  
   - Given that product 1 is a diketone, it is plausible that product 2 is an alkene formed via dehydration of the diketone, resulting in a conjugated or isolated double bond.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2 followed by workup with dimethyl sulfide**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is an alkene, product 3 will contain carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, if product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded.  
   - Each proton in the CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl would couple with the two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group and coupled to the two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group. This results in a triplet coupling pattern.

**Conclusion:** The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet. 

Answer: A
