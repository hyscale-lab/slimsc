Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light because they have non-superimposable mirror images, right? Those are chiral centers, I think. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, this is a biphenyl compound with substituents. Wait, biphenyls can have different substituents on each ring. But does this compound have a chiral center? Let me visualize it. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. At positions 6 and 2 on each ring are substituents. The substituents are nitro groups and the methyl esters. So the central single bond allows rotation, but in this case, the substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring... Wait, but wait. The compound is symmetrical? Let me think. If the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring, might the molecule be symmetric? Because if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, like each ring has the same groups in equivalent positions, then the molecule might not be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a chiral center in the biphenyl system. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, the biphenyl group itself can have axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent free rotation. So if the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Let me think: 6 is the para position relative to the connecting bond, and 2 is the meta. So maybe the substituents are arranged such that the two rings have different groups. But wait, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a ester group at 2. So each ring has substituents in the same positions. So perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because of symmetry. Wait, but the substituents are in positions that might make it asymmetrical. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. I'm not so sure about this one. I'll come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, and the ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OMe. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbon in the middle, the one with the OH group. Let's see, what's attached to it? The groups would be: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2. Wait no, wait, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate has three carbons. 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Hmm, the carbon with OH is the second carbon. So the groups attached are: a methyl (CH3), a hydroxyl (OH), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a CH2 group? Or wait, if it's CH2-CHOH-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to CH2, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; with the OH on the second carbon:

The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2OHCH2COOH. But when it's an ester, it's the acid with the -OH replaced by OMe. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2OHCH2COOCH3? No, wait, wait: Let me count the carbons. Propanoate is three carbons: COOCH2CH2-? No, wait, propanoate is the conjugate base of propanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, or CH3CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central CH2 group. Wait, no, the central carbon is the one with OH. Wait, no: the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the OH is on the first carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is:

COOCH3 connected to CH2, which is connected to CH2OH. So the central CH2 group is symmetric? No, wait, perhaps the molecule is:

The carbons are arranged as:

- The first carbon is CH2OH.
- The second carbon is CH2 connected to the first and the third.
- The third carbon is COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to number them. Let's say:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2OH.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would replace the CH2 with CH(OH)CH3, perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But that would make the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? Wait, maybe that's not correct. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps it's better to think that in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-O-CH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule has three carbons: the first is CH2(OH), the second is CH2, and the third is COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon (the CH2) is connected to the first and the third. So the carbons are:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central CH2 is attached to two CH2 groups? No, wait, the central carbon (the middle CH2) is attached to:

- One CH2(OH)
- One CH2 (which connects to COOCH3)
- And two H's? No, wait, no: each carbon must have four bonds. So maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. That would be 3-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a chiral center, the carbon must be attached to four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, let's say the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the middle CH2 is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2-COOCH3
- Two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be because each carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would mean the central CH2 is connected to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2 (from the other side)
- COOCH3
- And two H's.

Wait, that would make it a CH2 group, not a CH. So the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to two identical groups (the CH2(OH) and CH2-COOCH3). Wait, no, because each CH2 is connected to different groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think of the molecule as:

COOCH3 is on the first carbon, then a CH2, then a CH2OH. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: CH2 (connected to COOCH3 and Carbon 3)
Carbon 3: CH2OH (connected to Carbon 2 and the OH)

So, Carbon 2 is the central carbon. What's attached to it?

- COOCH3 (on Carbon 1)
- CH2OH (on Carbon 3)
- Two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be. Each carbon must have four bonds. So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (COOCH3)
- Carbon 3 (CH2OH)
- Two H's.

Wait, but that's only three bonds. I must be getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's better to think that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)COOCH2CH3. Wait, no, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH2(OH)COOCH2CH3, but that's four carbons, so not propanoate.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me step back. The correct way to approach this is to determine if the molecule has a chiral center. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, propanoate has three carbons. So it's CH2-CHOH-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central CH2 is between the OH-bearing CH2 and the COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2 (the other side)
- COOCH3
- And since it's CH2, two H's.

Wait, but that's not possible. Each carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that's three carbons. So the central carbon is the middle CH2, which is connected to:

- CH2(OH) (left)
- CH2 (right connected to COOCH3)
- Two H's.

Wait, but that would only have three substituents. Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, perhaps I should think about it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, that's three carbons: CH3, then CHOH, then COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In that case, the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (middle)
- COOCH3 (right)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so this would make the middle carbon a chiral center because it has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that would mean this compound has a chiral center, hence it can show optical isomerism. So moiety 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two phenyl groups and another O. Wait, no, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is an aryl group. So the central carbon is C, connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (O double-bonded), and another O as part of the carbonyl. Wait, no, the carbonyl is O double-bonded. So the central carbon is C=O, so the actual structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon is the one in the ketone. Is this carbon a chiral center? No, because it's double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups and another O (from the carbonyl). Wait, no, in the ketone, the central carbon has a double bond to O, so it can't be a chiral center because it's trigonal (double bond), so only three substituents. Therefore, benzophenone cannot have a chiral center and thus does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis or trans diastereomer of maleate. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so dimethyl fumarate is the diethyl ester of fumaric acid. Wait, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure: O
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumaric acid is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So the dimethyl ester would be MeOOCCH=CHCOOme. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, that's maleic acid. Wait, no, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me correct: maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH (cis di-carboxylic acid), and fumaric acid is the trans isomer, HO2C-CH=CH-COOH but with the two COOH groups on opposite sides. Wait, no, in structure, maleic acid is cis, fumaric acid is trans. But regardless, the ester dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups, OMe, on each end of a double bond. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme? No, wait, no. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans diasteromer. So, the structure would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=CH
|
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as OMeOOC-CH2-CH2-COO-OMe, but that's not accurate. No, wait, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme. No, wait, no, because butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, but butenedioic acid would have a double bond. Let me clarify: maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH (cis), fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH (trans). So the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, but wait, in any case, the molecule has a double bond. Now, can this molecule show optical isomerism? For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a different kind of stereoisomerism like axial chirality (as in biphenyl compounds) or geometric isomerism. But geometric isomerism (cis-trans) doesn't lead to optical isomerism, as geometric isomers are mirror images but not necessarily chiral.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is a trans diastereomer. Wait, wait, no: actually, dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester. But regardless, the question is whether it can exhibit optical isomerism. So, the molecule has a double bond. If the double bond is between two identical groups, can it lead to E/Z isomerism? Wait, no, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same, then E/Z isomerism isn't possible. Wait, in this case, each end of the double bond has two ester groups (OCH3) and two methyl groups from the ester carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't be chiral. So dimethyl fumarate has the structure MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme? No, wait, no, because fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure would be MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme, but wait, that's a single bond. No, wait, no, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer, so the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but if the molecule has a double bond and the substituents on each end are the same (two OMe groups on each carbon), then it's not a chiral molecule. Because for a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical, hence not chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each end of the double bond has two ester groups. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O-C-OCH3
O ?

No, wait, no. Let me think again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So each end has a MeOOC group attached to the double bond. Wait, but each carbon of the double bond has two OMe groups attached? No, each carbon of the double bond in fumarate would have two carbonyl groups from the esters.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that would make each end of the double bond identical, meaning that the molecule is symmetrical. So if each end is the same, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate is a trans-diesters, but since each end is the same, it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but another angle: dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond. If the substituents on each end are identical, then it's a meso compound, which is achiral. So in this case, the molecule is not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. If so, it's achiral.

So, considering all this, let's go back to each moiety.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Let's see, biphenyl compounds can have axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical. So if the substituents on each ring are in such positions that they are not mirror images, then the molecule can be chiral. In this case, the substituents are 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate on each ring. Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. So if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if each ring has a nitro at the 6 position (which is para to the connecting bond) and a carboxylate at the 2 position (which is meta), and the arrangement is such that the substituents on each ring are mirror images, then the molecule might be symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is such that the substituents are on opposite sides. Let me think: on ring 1, the nitro is at 6 (para) and the ester at 2 (meta), and ring 2 has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, but in such a way that the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged so that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. So for example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, then the molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it's chiral.

But I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule is symmetrical. The molecule has two rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Wait, position 6 on each ring is the same relative to the connecting bond. So the substituents on each ring are in the same positions. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Or perhaps it's not, because the way the substituents are arranged on each ring could cause asymmetry. For example, if one ring has nitro and ester in a certain configuration that the other doesn't mirror.

Hmm, maybe this is a case of a biphenyl with substituents in such a way that it's not symmetrical, leading to axial chirality. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule is chiral because the substituents prevent free rotation, making the molecule have a chiral axis. Wait, in biphenyls, axial chirality arises when the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical around the central bond.

So, if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in positions that are not mirror images, the biphenyl could be chiral. But in this case, each ring has the same substituents, but perhaps arranged in a way that's asymmetrical. For example, if one ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, and the other ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, but the positions on each ring are such that the molecule as a whole isn't symmetrical. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because each ring has the same substituents, the molecule could have a mirror plane through the central bond, making it achiral. So if the substituents are symmetrically placed, then the molecule isn't chiral. So in this case, maybe it's not showing optical isomerism.

2. As we concluded earlier, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound due to symmetry, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, which of the options are correct? Looking back at the question, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to our analysis, only moiety 2 shows optical isomerism. What about the others:

Moiety 1: I'm unsure, but perhaps it's chiral, so it would show optical isomerism.

Hmm, let me reevaluate. For moiety 1, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Let's imagine the biphenyl structure. The two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So, for each ring, the nitro is at position 6 (relative to the connecting bond at position 1), and the ester is at position 2 (relative to the connecting bond). So, the arrangement on each ring is the same. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, only moiety 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Hmm, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B) 3 and 4 → no, 3 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

C) 2 and 3 → no, 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → no, 1 doesn't.

Wait, this is a problem because none of the options would have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make a mistake about moiety 4, dimethyl fumarate?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme? No, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. But in this case, each end of the double bond has an ester group (OCH3) and a carbonyl group. Wait, no, each carbon of the double bond is connected to two ester groups? No, each end is connected to an ester group (OCH3) via the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (each end has MeOOC group), the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, only moiety 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing another moiety.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of moiety 4. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the double bond is between two CH groups, each connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In this case, each end of the double bond has O-C-OCH3. So the substituents on each end are the same. So the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. Only moiety 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options have only 2. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about moiety 1. Maybe it does show optical isomerism. Let me think: the structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 6 and 2 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a ester at 2. The biphenyl's two rings are connected via a single bond, which allows free rotation. But in this case, the substituents may be arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical. Wait, but if each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. So, the molecule would not show optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me go back and reevaluate each point. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of moiety 4. Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. But no, because the double bond is between two identical groups. So no chiral center there.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with moiety 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But wait, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

Hmm. So, the only moiety that shows optical isomerism is number 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about stereoisomerism, which includes both optical isomerism and other forms like geometric isomerism. But the question specifically asks about optical isomerism, which is caused by chirality.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I was wrong about moiety 4. Let me think again. If the molecule is dimethyl fumarate, and the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme, then the molecule is symmetrical (since it's a single bond), and thus not chiral. But if it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, and the substituents on each end are different, then the molecule could be chiral. Wait, no, in this case, each end has the same substituents (OCH3 and COOme), so the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral.

Wait, maybe the substituents are different. But no, both ends have the same groups, so it's symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about moiety 1. Let me think again. The substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring, which are equivalent positions. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, the only correct moiety is 2. But looking at the options, none of them match. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH (from the center)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- H (from the hydrogen attached to the carbon).

So the four groups are all different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, this is a chiral center, so the molecule shows optical isomerism. So, moiety 2 is correct.

Are there any other moieties that show optical isomerism? Let's see:

Moiety 4: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme, then it's a single bond, and the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. But if the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, but the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it would be chiral. Wait, but in that case, each end has the same substituents, so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral.

So, the only correct moieties are 2. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 2 is correct.

B)3 and 4 → no.

C)2 and 3 → no.

D)1 and 2 → if 1 is correct, then 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about moiety 1. Maybe it does show optical isomerism. Let me think: the substituents on each ring are at 6 and 2. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the two rings are mirror images, but the overall molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, one ring has the nitro at 6 in a certain orientation, and the other ring has the nitro at 6 in a different orientation, making the molecule asymmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides, leading to no symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring has a nitro and an ester in such positions that the molecule as a whole is chiral. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: if the two substituents (nitro and ester) on each ring are in positions that are not mirror images, the molecule would be chiral. For example, if on one ring, the nitro is at 6 and the ester is at 2, and on the other ring, the nitro is at 6 and the ester is at 2, but their arrangement (like which side of the connecting bond) makes the molecule asymmetrical.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the biphenyl group having substituents that are not symmetrical. So in this case, the molecule would have a chiral axis, leading to optical isomerism.

So, perhaps moiety 1 does show optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then the correct moieties are 1 and 2. So the correct option would be D) 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that moiety 1 is symmetrical, but perhaps I was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule have axial chirality. For example, the two nitro groups are on the same side, making the molecule lack a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the two nitro groups are on opposite sides, but the ester groups are on the same side, leading to a chiral arrangement.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. But since the question is multiple-choice, perhaps the intended answer is that moieties 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

So, in the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → 4 is incorrect.

B) 3,4 → incorrect.

C) 2 and3 → incorrect.

D) 1 and 2 → correct.

So, the answer would be D.

To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a carbon atom (or another element) bonded to four different groups or a lack of symmetry that prevents superimposability of the molecule with its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Moiety:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 6 (nitro) and 2 (carboxylate) on each ring. The biphenyl system can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically. Since the substituents are in the same positions (6 and 2) on each ring, the molecule may lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups, making it symmetrical and achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) diester of fumaric acid, with the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a double bond, and the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical (one MeOOC group and one H on each carbon). This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Moiety 1: Exhibits optical isomerism due to potential axial chirality in the biphenyl system.  
- Moiety 2: Exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Moiety 3: Does not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.  
- Moiety 4: Does not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.

The correct answer is **1 and 2**.
