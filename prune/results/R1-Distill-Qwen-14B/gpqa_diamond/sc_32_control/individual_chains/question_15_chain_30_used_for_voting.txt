Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their probabilities of transiting. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit so that the researchers can prioritize their observation time. Let's see what I remember about transits and how to calculate the probability.

So, from what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of the star from our point of view, so the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on.

I think the formula for the probability (P) is something like P = (R_planet + R_star) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5), but wait, no, maybe that's the formula for the duration of the transit. Or is it the impact parameter? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit is mainly influenced by the size of the star and the planet, and the orbital distance. The probability is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, a) to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is actually given by (R_star / a)² divided by (1 - (R_star / a)^2), but that might be for the area where the planet's path could intersect the star's disk. So the bigger the star relative to the planet's orbit, the higher the chance of a transit. Because if the star is larger, the planet has a larger area to cover, so higher probability.

Alternatively, I think the geometric probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a), where R_star is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet's path on the sky has to cross our line of sight, which is a small area compared to the star's disk. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but maybe that's an approximation.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability formula I remember is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So the probability is proportional to R_star divided by the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius. Oh, the question says: both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2. Because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but both have same radii. So that part is the same.

So the probability depends only on the semi-major axis of each planet's orbit. Since P is proportional to R_star / a, and since R is the same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So a planet with a smaller a (shorter orbital period) has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking back at the problem, Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so Planet_1's period is shorter. So that means its semi-major axis is smaller because, from Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed.

Wait, Kepler's law: P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) a³. Since M is the mass of the star and m is the planet's mass. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M + m ≈ M. So P² ∝ a³ / M.

So for each planet, we can write P1² = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³,

P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³.

So, the ratio of a1 to a2 is ( (P1² M1) / (P2² M2) )^(1/3).

Given that P1 is (1/3) P2, and M1 is twice M2 (M1 = 2 M2).

So substituting, a1/a2 = [ ( ( (1/3) P2 )² * 2 M2 ) / ( P2² * M2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator: (1/9 P2²) * 2 M2

Denominator: P2² M2.

So the ratio becomes ( (2/9) P2² M2 ) / ( P2² M2 ) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = (2^(1/3)) / (3^(2/3)) )

Wait, let me compute that numerically. 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the ratio a1/a2.

Wait, let me re-express:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (P1² M1) / (P2² M2 )

P1 = P2 /3,

M1 = 2 M2,

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = ( (P2/3)^2 * 2 M2 ) / ( P2^2 * M2 )

= ( (P2² /9 ) * 2 M2 ) / (P2² M2 )

= (2 M2 P2² /9 ) / ( M2 P2² )

= 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

Thus, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approx 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So since a1 is smaller than a2, P1 (probability) is larger than P2.

Because P ∝ R_star / a.

Since R1 = R2, then P1 = (R/a1) and P2 = (R/a2).

So P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Because a1 is 0.606 a2, a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait: is the probability proportional to R/a, or is there another factor?

Wait, I think I might have gotten the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The actual geometric probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2))) ) or something like that.

Wait, no, I'm confusing the formula with the transit duration. Let me think again.

The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. So P = (R_star / a) divided by (1 + ... something? Or is it simply (R_star / a) times some factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. I think the correct formula for the probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it approximates to R_star / a.

But in this question, both stars have the same radius, so R1 = R2 = R.

So P1 = R / a1,

P2 = R / a2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

We found a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 = approx 0.606 a2.

So a2/a1 is approx 1.65, meaning P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1, which has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait a moment. How did I get the ratio?

Because a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no, a1 is smaller than a2. So a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 * 1.65.

So when calculating P1 and P2, P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2) = R/(1.65 a1) → P2 = P1 / 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability, and the factor is 1.65.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

The probability of detecting a transit of an exoplanet depends on the alignment of its orbit and the relative sizes of the planet and the star. The geometric probability of a transit is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars in this scenario have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability of a transit depends inversely on the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

From Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \) and a host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 \) and a host star mass \( M_2 \).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is given by:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{P_1^2 M_1}{P_2^2 M_2} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2 (2M_2)}{P_2^2 M_2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Numerically, \( \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 due to its higher probability of transiting.
