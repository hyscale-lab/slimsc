Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds have non-superimposable mirror images, right? So they are chiral. Chiral molecules have a center of asymmetry, like a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations of the compounds. Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, so each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The structure is symmetrical across the central bond, I think. Wait, but when two substituents are on each ring, are they arranged in a way that creates a chiral center? Let me visualize. Biphenyl with substituents in positions 2 and 6. If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, maybe they're arranged symmetrically. But wait, dimethyl esters, so each ring has a COOCH3 group at 2 and a nitro group at 6. Are these positions leading to any chirality? Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can rotate, but with the substituents, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. Hmm, I'm not so sure. Maybe if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it will have optical isomers. Alternatively, if the centers are chiral. Wait, the molecule has two substituents on each ring, but if the substituents are across from each other, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Wait, 6 is opposite 2 on a benzene ring, so each ring has a nitro at 6 and carbamate at 2, but in the biphenyl, the two rings are connected at 1. So the arrangement might be such that the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound, which would have internal planes of symmetry and thus no optical isomerism. Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If substituents are on opposite ends, perhaps a plane exists. Or perhaps the molecule is chiral because of the arrangement of substituents around the central bond. Wait, maybe the central bond is single, so the two rings can't rotate, which could mean that the substituents are in fixed positions. So if each ring has a substituent on the same side, perhaps the molecule is chiral. But I'm not certain. Maybe I can come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH becomes OMe. So the structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, is this molecule chiral? Let's see: the central carbon (the one attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH2). Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH(CH3)COOCH3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, but that's adjacent to the ester group. Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2-OH-CH2-COOCH3? But wait, that would be a straight chain. Wait, but that would make the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think of the structure. The acid is propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, looking at the central carbon: it's connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? No, wait, the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one with the OH. The groups attached are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH (i.e., CH from CH3-CH(OH)-...). Wait, no, actually, the central carbon is the one with OH: it's connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH (but actually, it's CH3CH2COOH). So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Esterifying that would replace the -OH on the COOH with OMe. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon (the one attached to OH and CH3). So the groups are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH (from CH3CH...). Wait, but wait, the adjacent group is another CH2? Or perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

   O
   ||
CH3-C-O-OCH3
    |  
    OH

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

  O
  ||
CH2-C(OH)-CH3
   |
   OMe

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to: CH3 (from CH3-), OH, COOCH3, and another CH (from the CH in CH(OH)). So four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon is the one in the middle—so it's the second carbon. It's attached to: CH3 (from the first carbon), OH, COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and the third carbon (which is a carbonyl). So does that make it a chiral center? Because all four substituents are different.

Yes, because the groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon which is attached to the carbonyl group. So that's four different groups. So that would make it a chiral center, hence the molecule has optical isomers. So compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. That's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl. Structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, is this molecule chiral? Chiral centers require four different substituents. Here, the central carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. Also, the two phenyl groups are identical. So the molecule is symmetric. Any chance of another type of chirality? Like allenes or something else? No, benzophenone is planar around the carbonyl and has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups. So no optical isomerism here. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, right? So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester with two methyl groups. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. Since it's a trans configuration, the groups on each end are opposite. Wait, but in this case, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. Now, does this molecule have any stereogenic centers? No, because each ester group is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH2CH2 with double bond, and two ester groups on the ends.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 on both ends? So each end is OMe. Wait, no: the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, wait, fumarate is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. When esterified with methanol, each -OH becomes OMe. So it's MeOOCCH=CHCOO Me. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So it's MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait: the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would be succinate dimethyl ester, but without a double bond. Fumarate would have a double bond between the two carbonyl groups. So it's MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond, but wait, no, that can't be. Let me correct: Fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So when esterified, it's MeOOC-CHCH-COOCH3. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but with a double bond? No, wait, perhaps the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is attached to a carbonyl group.

So in the dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. Now, does this molecule have any stereoisomerism? Well, the molecule is a dienophile, but in terms of stereoisomerism, it's a trans (E) configuration. Wait, but does that create any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups. For example, each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH (the other part of the double bond). Wait, no, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think: each end of the double bond is a CH group. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH on the other side of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3   C=C   O=C-OCH3
    \       /
     CH2   CH2 ?

No, wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, that's succinic acid. Wait, no, wait: butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, butenedioic is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the two carbons in the double bond each have a COOCH3 group and a methyl group (from the double bond). Wait, no, each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH (the other part of the double bond). So each of those carbons is attached to two identical groups? No, wait: each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH from the other side. So perhaps each of those carbons has two different groups: COOCH3 and CH2? No, because the other side is another CH. Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two identical groups on each end, so no stereoisomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound.

Wait, when you have a double bond with two identical groups on each end, like in fumarate, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate, which is the diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, which is cis. Since fumarate is trans, does that create any stereoisomerism? Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is itself a single enantiomer or a meso compound?

Wait, the molecule MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3: are the two CH groups each connected to two identical groups? Each CH has groups: COOCH3, and CH connected to the other double bond. So each CH has the same substituents on both sides. No, because each CH is connected to COOCH3 and another CH (the other end of the double bond). So each CH has two identical groups (if the substituents are same on both ends). Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are the same on each side. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Then, it wouldn't have optical isomerism because the meso form is achiral. So dimethyl fumarate would not exhibit optical isomerism. Or wait, did I get that wrong?

Wait, no. Maleic acid is cis (HOOC-CHCH-COOH), and fumaric is trans (HOOC-CH=CH-COOH). When esterified, the same applies. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. But does this create a chiral center? Let me think again. Each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH group (the other end of the double bond). So each of those carbons has two identical substituents: COOCH3 and a CH group. So each carbon is attached to two identical groups, meaning no chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism either.

Wait, but wait. Fumaric acid is in the trans configuration, which means that the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the two halves mirror each other, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate as a meso compound would have no optical isomerism. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes when you have a double bond with substituents, but those substituents are the same on each side, the molecule can be meso. For example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters but is meso if both are in the same configuration. So in the case of fumarate, is the molecule a meso form? Let me think: the two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But each carbon (the ones in the double bond) are attached to two identical groups: COOCH3 and the adjacent CH. Wait, no, the adjacent CH is part of the double bond. So each of those carbons is connected to two substituents: COOCH3 and another group that's part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: does dimethyl fumarate have any stereocenters? Let's see: each carbon in the double bond is connected to COOCH3 and another CH group. So each carbon has groups: COOCH3, CH, and two other substituents (from the double bond). Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is sp² hybridized, so they have three substituents each. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure it.

The structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - C=O-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the structure is:

O
|| 
O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - C=O-OCH3

Wait, no, that's the succinate ester. Fumarate is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 - CH=CH - C=O-OCH3

So the double bond is between the two CH groups. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH. So each CH is connected to COOCH3, and two H's? No, wait, each CH is bonded to COOCH3, another CH (via the double bond), and two H's? So each of these carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, a CH (from the double bond), and two Hs. So each of these carbons isn't a chiral center because they don't have four different substituents. Hence, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. So compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: some compounds can have stereoisomerism due to double bonds (cis-trans), but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. So in this case, the molecule itself doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about this. Let me think again. If a compound has a double bond, and the groups on either side are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and thus not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So now, going back to the four compounds.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Hmm, biphenyl with substituents. Let's think about the structure. The biphenyl has two rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Now, 6 is the para position to 2 on each ring. Wait, so each ring has substituents opposite each other. So in the biphenyl, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So in each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are across from each other.

Now, in the biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected at position 1. So the substituents on each ring are at the 2 and 6 positions, which are across from each other. So the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine it: both rings have the same substituents, each in the same positions. So the molecule would be symmetrical, leading to a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism. But wait, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents on the biphenyl leads to the molecule being chiral. Let me think: if the substituents are in positions that don't mirror each other, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Wait, but the substituents are symmetrical. Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at 2 and 6. So the arrangement of substituents on each ring is mirrored, leading the entire molecule to have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Thus, compound 1 would not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about the structure again. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So if the two rings are connected at 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para to each other, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule has a center of symmetry. So that the two substituents on each ring are aligned in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another possibility. Maybe the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. For example, if the substituents are all on the same face or something. Wait, but in this compound, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So for each ring, substituents are on opposite ends. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: if the molecule has a center of inversion, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. So if each substituent is mirrored across the central bond, then the molecule is achiral. So in this case, the substituents are on each ring in the same positions, making the molecule symmetric. Thus, no optical isomerism for compound 1.

So, summarizing:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. Yes, has optical isomerism.

3. No.

4. No.

So among the four compounds, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Wait, but looking back at the options, let's see the options given.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Wait, according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. So which option includes only 2? Looking at the options, option A includes 2 and 4, but 4 doesn't show it. Option D includes 1 and 2. Since 1 doesn't, then D would have only 2, but that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck each compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Is there a possibility of the molecule being chiral despite the double bond?

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. For dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans (E) isomer, does it have a plane of symmetry? Yes, because each substituent on the double bond is mirrored on the other side. So the molecule is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So back to the four compounds, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But wait, looking at the options again, none of the options have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are wrong.

B)3,4 → both wrong.

C)2,3 → 2 correct, 3 incorrect.

D)1,2 → both incorrect.

So according to this, none of the options are correct. But that can't be. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Let me reevaluate compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Now, in a biphenyl, the positions 2 and 6 are across from each other on each ring. So the substituents are in para positions on each ring. But the biphenyl's substituents could be arranged in a way that breaks symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents are on each ring in such a way that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is in a position that creates a chiral center. Wait, no, the substituents are on aromatic rings, which don't have chiral centers. The chiral centers would be in the biphenyl's structure. But wait, perhaps the entire molecule's structure leads to chirality.

Wait, another approach: think of the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at position 1. Each ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Now, if these substituents are oriented in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a chiral axis or plane. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it could be chiral. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, leading to a plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro is on the same side on each ring, then the molecule would be symmetric. But if the substituents are arranged differently, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, making the molecule symmetric. So the molecule would be achiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another type of stereogenic element, such as a plane or axis that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

In compound 2, we have a chiral center, so it exhibits optical isomerism.

Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral, as discussed.

What about compound 1? Could it have a chiral center or another type of stereogenic element?

Wait, biphenyl compounds can sometimes exhibit axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism based on the rotation around the central bond. For example, in biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can have enantiomers.

So, compound 1: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The substituents on each ring are para to each other. Now, the question is whether the arrangement of substituents on each ring leads to a lack of symmetry in the entire molecule.

Wait, if the nitro and carboxylate on each ring are in positions that result in the two rings having substituents arranged in a non-symmetrical way, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. If these substituents are both in the same positions relative to the central bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

But perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl's two rings have substituents arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis or center.

Wait, another approach: the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6. If the two rings are connected at position 1, then the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are across from each other. So the molecule's substituents are symmetric with respect to the central bond. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in that case, only compound 2 does.

But looking back at the options, which option includes only 2? The options given are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 don't.

B)3,4 → both incorrect.

C)2,3 → 2 correct, 3 incorrect.

D)1,2 → both incorrect.

Hmm, none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing another compound.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So the molecule is in the trans configuration. Now, does that make it a meso compound?

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, hence achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Wait, no, in this case, it's symmetrical.

So, I think my analysis is correct, and only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2, 4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B)3, 4 → both incorrect.

C)2,3 → 2 correct, 3 incorrect.

D)1,2 → both incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if each ring has substituents arranged in a way that prevents a plane of symmetry.

Another possibility: the molecule has a chiral axis (axial chirality) because the biphenyl has substituents arranged in a non-symmetrical way. Axial chirality occurs when the central bond is single, and the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So for example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. But if the substituents on each ring are not in the same orientation relative to the central bond, that could break the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, let me think: in each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. If the substituents are on the same face of each ring, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if they're on opposite faces, perhaps the molecule becomes chiral.

Wait, but each substituent is in a para position on their respective rings. So the arrangement could be such that the substituents on each ring are in the same orientation relative to the central bond. For example, both nitro groups are on the same side of the central bond, and both carboxylate groups are on the same side. That would create a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.

Alternatively, if one nitro is on one side and the other nitro is on the opposite side, perhaps the molecule becomes chiral. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule has a center of asymmetry, leading to chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Hmm, I'm not confident about this, but I'll proceed with my initial conclusion.

So, from my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Since none of the options match that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, each of the two CH groups in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH group from the double bond. Wait, but that's not correct. Each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3, and the other CH is connected to another COOCH3 and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps each CH has two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. No, each CH is connected to one COOCH3, two Hs, and a double bond. So each CH has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has any stereogenic centers. Since each CH in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (H's), they can't be stereogenic centers. So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 does.

But looking at the options, I'm stuck because the options don't have an option that includes only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think about dimethyl fumarate again. If the molecule has two ester groups on a trans double bond, it could have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I should consider each option and see which compounds in the options exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

Option B:3,4 → both incorrect.

Option C:2,3 → 2 correct,3 incorrect.

Option D:1,2 → both incorrect.

So, the only option where any of the compounds are correct is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I thought 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. When you have a double bond with different groups on each end, you can have geometric isomerism, but that's different from optical isomerism. So E and Z are geometric isomers, but they don't relate directly to optical isomerism unless the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, but if the molecule itself is chiral, then it will have optical isomers. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, because of the double bond, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Wait, but as I thought earlier, each CH in the double bond is attached to two identical groups, so no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I think my initial conclusion is correct: only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct option would be the one that includes 2. Looking at the options, option A includes 2, but also 1 and 4, which I don't think are correct. Option C includes 2 and 3, which I don't think is correct. Then perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl is connected at position 1. So substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Now, the question is whether the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then it's a meso compound and achiral. If not, then it's chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, which are in para positions. So, if the substituents on each ring are in the same orientation relative to the central bond, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So, no optical isomerism.

But if the substituents are in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro and carboxylate on each ring are on the same face relative to the central bond, but the other ring's substituents are on the opposite face. That would break the symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

But wait, in the given compound, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, the positions are fixed. If both substituents on each ring are on the same face, perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has two chiral centers. Wait, but where would they be? The rings are aromatic, so no chiral centers on the rings. The central bond is single, but it's part of the aromatic rings.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think that compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism, so only compound 2 does. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: I'm wrong about compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism. Let me think: if the molecule has a center of asymmetry, then it's chiral. But I can't find any.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. For example, in the ester groups. Wait, no, the ester groups are symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 1. Let me look up an example. For instance, does biphenyl with substituents at para positions on each ring exhibit optical isomerism?

Upon searching, I recall that biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality when the substituents are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,2-diphenylethane, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. If the substituents on each ring are in the same orientation relative to the central bond, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. But if they are in opposite orientations, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but in compound 1, the substituents are in positions that might lead to a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule is achiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral. Without a clear structure, it's hard to tell, but I'll proceed with my initial analysis.

So, I think only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. If the molecule has a center of asymmetry, then it's chiral. Another approach: the molecule has four substituents around the central carbon. No, in compound 4, the central carbon is double-bonded, so it's not a chiral center.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. Looking at the options, none of them have only 2. But perhaps I made a mistake, and compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option A, which includes 2 and 4. But I thought 4 doesn't exhibit it.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. If the molecule is not a meso compound, perhaps it's chiral. So, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, for fumarate (E), the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does that create a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine: if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So it would be a meso compound, thus achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, I think I have to conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 1. Let me think again: if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Another way to think: for a compound to have optical isomers, it must have a non-superimposable mirror image. So, if the molecule has a center of asymmetry or a plane that makes it non-superimposable, it will have optical isomers.

In compound 1, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it would have optical isomerism.

But without a clear structure, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the information, I'll proceed.

So, the final conclusion is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have an option that includes only 2, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me try to visualize it again.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each substituent is a nitro and a carboxylate. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 6 and 2. The question is whether the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, I'll conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a chiral center, so it has optical isomers. Dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) has a double bond with substituents on each end, but no chiral centers. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, among the options, the correct answer would be the one that includes only compound 2. But looking at the options, none of them include only 2. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. This creates a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image because the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, but earlier I thought it had a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because it lacks a plane of symmetry, despite being in the trans configuration. Hmm, I'm not sure.

In that case, perhaps compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism, making option A (1,2,4) incorrect because I thought 1 doesn't. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not completely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the four compounds again.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents are on the same face of each ring, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has axial chirality because the substituents on each ring are in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule could be chiral, thus exhibiting optical isomerism.

In that case, compound 1 would show optical isomerism, making option A (1,2,4) incorrect if 4 doesn't, but then 2 and 1 would. Alternatively, perhaps 1 is chiral.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only 2 and 4 may exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) is (E)-butenedioate. If the molecule is not meso, then it would have optical isomers. But I thought it's meso.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4. But I'm not confident.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have non-superimposable mirror images. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center, axial chirality, or another form of stereogenicity.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with a nitro group and a carboxylate group at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, creating a plane of symmetry. As a result, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one attached to OH, CH₃, COOCH₃, and the adjacent CH) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups. This makes the molecule chiral, and it exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not act as a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups, making it achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate has the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the trans (E) isomer of butenedioate. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH₃ and H), so there are no chiral centers. The molecule also has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (1, 2, 4):** Compound 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism, so this option is incorrect.  
- **Option B (3, 4):** Both compounds 3 and 4 are achiral, so this option is incorrect.  
- **Option C (2, 3):** Compound 3 is achiral, so this option is incorrect.  
- **Option D (1, 2):** Compound 1 is achiral, so this option is incorrect.  

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options correctly include only compound 2. Given the constraints of the question, the closest option is **A (1, 2, 4)**, despite the earlier conclusion that compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Answer: A**
