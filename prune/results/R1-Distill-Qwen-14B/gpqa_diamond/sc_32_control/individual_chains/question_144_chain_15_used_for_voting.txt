Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay distance (L) is L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the lifetime. 

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh, right, the lifetime is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But I think I might have to be careful with units here.

Wait, let me make sure. The natural line width formula is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, no, actually the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a particle's lifetime, the uncertainty in energy is the width Γ. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Hence, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should check the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·seconds? Wait, no. Let me think in terms of units. Planck's constant ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Oh wait, because ħ = h/(2π), and h is 6.626e-34 J·s. But converting J to eV, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s = 6.626e-34 / 1.6e-19 eV·s = about 4.14e-15 eV·s. Then ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 4.14e-15/(6.28) ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s. Wait, but since the units here are GeV, I need to convert. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Yes, that's right.

So, τ is ħ divided by Γ. But Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is... 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, actually, no: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV gives (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. So yeah, 20.56875 * 1e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582/(0.32) * 1e-25 = approx 20.568 * 1e-25 = 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 * 20 is 6.4. 0.32*20.5 = 6.56. 0.32*20.568 = let me compute 20 *0.32=6.4, 0.568 *0.32=0.18176, so total 6.58176. So 0.32 * 20.568 ≈6.58176, so 6.582 /0.32 ≈ 20.568. So it's 20.568 * 1e-25 = 2.0568e-24 seconds. That's the lifetime τ.

Now, I need the velocity v. How do I find that? Since the particle is produced with energy E_X, which is 8 GeV. The mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can compute the velocity using relativistic equations. 

The relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But wait, since m is given in GeV and E in GeV, and c² would have units that make it so that E in GeV corresponds to m c² in GeV. So perhaps I can ignore c for the purpose of unit calculation, but I need to make sure that units are consistent.

Wait, but to find the velocity, perhaps it's better to calculate β = v/c, because in relativity, β is often used. So let's compute β.

We have E = γ m c², and the momentum p = γ m v = γ m β c. So, the energy squared is E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So let's compute E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. 

But I don't know p, but perhaps I can express β in terms of E and m. Since E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2, and p = γ m v = γ m β c. So,

E² = (γ m β c²)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Divide both sides by (m c²)^2:

(E/(m c²))² = (γ β )² + 1.

But γ = E/(m c²), so:

γ² = (γ β )² + 1.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me rearrange it.

γ² - γ² β² = 1.

But γ² (1 - β²) =1.

But 1 - β^2 = (1 - v²/c²), which is 1/gamma squared. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's calculate gamma = E/(m c²). So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Gamma is about 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225= 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta ≈ 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma is 6.666666...

Then beta squared is 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = 1 - 1/(44.444444...) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute that. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.9887 squared is about (0.98)^2=0.9604. 0.9887^2: 98.87^2 = let's compute 98.87 *98.87. 100^2=10000; 98.87 is 1.13 less. So (100 -1.13)^2 = 10000 - 2*100*1.13 + 1.13^2 = 10000 - 226 + 1.2769≈ 9775.2769. So 98.87^2= 9775.28 cm² or so. Wait, but in our case, 0.9887^2 is 0.9775. So that's correct.

So the velocity v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but I think I can calculate this more precisely. Let me compute 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666666666666666..., so gamma is 6.666... So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9=44.444444...

1/gamma squared is 9/400=0.0225.

Thus, beta squared is 1-0.0225=0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

I think 0.9887^2=0.9775, as I did earlier. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v=0.9887 c.

Now, putting it all together. The mean decay length L is v*tau.

Tau we had earlier as about 2.0568e-24 seconds. Wait, let me check again: tau= ħ/(Γ)= (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= approximately 2.0568e-24 seconds.

But wait, let me re-calculate the exact value. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

So 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 seconds = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, v is 0.9887 c, where c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L= v * tau = 0.9887 * c * tau.

Compute that:

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16 meters.

Compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

Hmm, 2*2.966=5.932; 0.056875 is about 5.6875e-2. 2.966 *0.056875≈ 0.1688.

So total approx 5.932 + 0.1688 = 6.1008.

So L ≈ 6.1008e-16 meters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me do it step by step.

2.056875 * 2.966:

Let's compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

0.9 * 2.056875=1.8511875.

0.06 * 2.056875=0.1234125.

0.006 * 2.056875=0.01234125.

Adding them all: 4.11375 +1.8511875=5.9649375. Then +0.1234125=6.08835. Then +0.01234125=6.09935 approximately.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 2.966 * 2.056875.

I can write 2.966 as 3 - 0.034.

So (3 - 0.034) * 2.056875 = 3*2.056875 - 0.034 * 2.056875.

3 * 2.056875=6.170625.

0.034 *2.056875=0.06993375.

So 6.170625 - 0.06993375=6.10069125.

So approximately 6.10069e-16 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, D is 4.0655e-16, etc. Wait, none of the options match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me check all the steps again.

Wait, perhaps when calculating tau, I made a mistake.

Wait, the formula is tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 divided by 0.32: 0.32 *20 is 6.4, 0.32*20.568 is about 6.582.

So 20.568e-25 = 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, v is 0.9887c.

So v=0.9887 *3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Hmm, another way: 3e8 *0.9887= 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L= (2.9661e8 m/s) * (2.0568e-24 s) = 2.9661e8 * 2.0568e-24 m.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.9661 * 2.0568.

Hmm, let me compute that.

2.9661 * 2 =5.9322, 2.9661 *0.0568= about 0.1687.

Total approx 5.9322 + 0.1687=6.1009.

So 6.1009e-16 meters. So about 6.1e-16 meters.

Looking back at the options, none of the options are 6e-16. The options are:

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

So my calculated value is approximately 6e-16, but the closest is option A (5.0e-16) or D (4.0e-16). So perhaps I made a mistake in computing gamma or beta.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. E is 8 GeV. m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8/1.2=6.666666667.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Beta squared is 1 -1/(gamma^2) =1 -1/(44.4444444)= 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps tau is miscalculated. Let me double-check. Gamma is 0.32 GeV, which is 320 MeV.

Wait, let me check the units for tau again. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So tau=6.582e-25 /0.32=20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the mean lifetime formula is different. Alternatively, is it tau = ħ/(Gamma) or Gamma = ħ/tau?

Wait, the natural linewidth formula is Gamma ≈ ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma. So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should double-check the velocity calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the meson is a boson, but I don't think that affects the decay length calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mean decay length is c * tau * beta.

Wait, that's the same as v * tau, because v=beta c.

So L = c * beta * tau.

So that's the same as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma =8/(1.2)=6.666666666667.

Then, beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.44444444444444)) )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887 as before. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

0.9775 is between 0.98^2=0.9604 and 0.99^2=0.9801. So 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775. Let me compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

First compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

Then, 0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.008526.

Then, 0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526.

And 0.0087^2=0.00007569.

So total is 0.9604 + 0.008526 + 0.008526 + 0.00007569.

Adding them:

0.9604 + 0.008526 = 0.968926.

+0.008526: 0.977452.

+0.00007569: 0.97752769.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775, but very close. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation. Let me compute 0.9887^2.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

Compute 9887 * 9887:

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as (a + b)^2 where a=9800, b=87.

But perhaps a better way:

9887 *9887.

Let me compute:

First, 9887 * 9887.

Well, 9887 × 9887 = (approx) 9887².

But perhaps a better approach is to compute (9887)^2 = ?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 0.9887^2 = 0.9775, which is correct.

So no mistake there.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, let me recompute L:

v = beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.9661 * 2.056875 * 1e-16 m.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.056875.

Let me do it step by step:

2.056875 * 2 =4.11375.

2.056875 * 0.9 = 1.8511875.

2.056875 * 0.06 =0.1234125.

2.056875 * 0.006=0.01234125.

Adding all the parts:

4.11375 +1.8511875=5.9649375.

+0.1234125=6.08835.

+0.01234125=6.09935 +.

Wait, that's 6.09935e-16 m.

So L≈6.099e-16 m.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option A (5.0223e-16) and D (4.0655e-16). Hmm, but neither is near 6e-16. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of tau?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when calculating tau. Let me check again.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for c.

c is approximately 2.99792e8 m/s. Maybe using a more precise value for c would change the calculation a bit.

So let me recalculate v with c=2.99792e8 m/s.

v= beta * c = 0.9887 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 0.9887 * 2.99792e8.

Let me compute 0.9887 * 2.99792e8.

It's approximately 2.966e8 m/s, as before.

So even with a more accurate c, v is about 2.966e8 m/s.

So L remains approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But the options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for L. Another possibility: perhaps I should use the mean lifetime as tau = ħ/(2 pi Gamma), or something else. Wait, no, the uncertainty principle is Delta E * Delta t ≈ ħ/2, but in particle physics, the width is typically given as Gamma, and tau is approximated as ħ/(Gamma). But perhaps it's ħ/(2 pi Gamma) or something similar. Let me think.

The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So yes, tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, wait: The decay width Γ is equal to ħ / τ. So Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma. So that's correct.

So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, let me check the production energy. The energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 8 -1.2=6.8 GeV? Or is E the total energy including rest mass? Because in the rest frame, the energy is just mc², so in the lab frame (assuming this is the production frame), the total energy is 8 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use the total energy E=8 GeV, which includes the rest mass. So yes, my initial approach was correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the meson is at rest. But that would mean that the velocity is zero, which can't be right because production energy is higher than rest mass. So the meson is moving.

Hmm, I'm stuck. My calculation leads me to approximately 6e-16 meters, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing the velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v using the relativistic relation between energy and momentum.

E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².

So p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2) / c.

So p = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV / c.

But units are a bit tricky here. Let me compute E in GeV, m in GeV.

So E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So (E)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

But in units where c=1 (natural units), E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c.

So p =7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, then p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

Wait, m is 1.2 GeV/c².

So gamma m beta c = p =7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = (p c)/(gamma m).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and v=beta c.

So, p = gamma m beta c.

We can express beta as p c/(gamma m).

But perhaps it's easier to compute beta from the momentum and the energy.

Alternatively, beta = pc / E.

Because, since E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2, so (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2.

Divide both sides by E²: (pc/E)^2 = 1 - (m² c^4)/(E²).

So pc/E = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E²)).

But v = beta c = (pc)/(gamma m c) ) * c.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: beta = (pc)/(E).

Because, from E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So,

beta = pc/(E) = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / E.

But in units where c=1, this simplifies to beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Which is the same as before.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64))= sqrt(1 - 0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So that's correct.

So I'm back to the same beta. So earlier calculation of L must be correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, perhaps the lifetime is 2.056875e-24 seconds, and the velocity is 2.966e8 m/s, so the product is 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.1e-16 meters.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the natural units where ħ= c=1. Then, the decay length is L= v tau * c.

Wait, no, because in natural units, c=1, so the units would be in inverse energy times time. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the decay length in terms of the particle's properties.

The decay length L is given by L = c * tau * beta.

And tau = ħ/(Gamma).

So L = (c * ħ) * beta / Gamma.

So plugging in the numbers:

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

Beta=0.9887.

So,

L= (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) * 0.9887 / 0.32 GeV.

The GeV units cancel out.

So,

L= (3e8) * (6.582e-25) * 0.9887 / 0.32 * (m/s * s) → meters.

Compute the numbers:

3e8 *6.582e-25 = (3 *6.582) * 1e-17 =19.746e-17.

Multiply by 0.9887: 19.746e-17 * 0.9887 ≈19.51e-17.

Divide by 0.32: 19.51e-17 /0.32 ≈60.96875e-17 =6.096875e-16 m.

So same result as before.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 6.1e-16 meters.

But none of the options match that. The options are:

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma and beta.

Wait, perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, the question states that the production energy is E_X=8 GeV. So is that the total energy or the kinetic energy?

If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_kin + m c^2. So E_total = 8 GeV + 1.2 GeV =9.2 GeV. Then, gamma would be 9.2/1.2 ≈7.6667.

Then beta would be sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2)).

Gamma=7.6667, gamma^2=58.7778.

1/(gamma^2)=0.017035.

So beta^2=1-0.017035=0.982965 → beta≈0.99146.

Then, let's recalculate:

Gamma is 7.6667, beta=0.99146.

Tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

v=0.99146*3e8=2.97438e8 m/s.

L=v*tau=2.97438e8 *2.056875e-24= 2.97438 *2.056875e-16.

2.97438 *2.056875≈6.123.

So L≈6.123e-16 m.

Still no match with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but perhaps I should use Gamma in MeV instead of GeV.

Wait, no, because when converting ħ to GeV·s, the units must match. So the calculation was correct.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps I should calculate the decay length as L= c * tau * gamma beta, but I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use gamma = beta gamma.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for L. Let me think again.

The mean decay length is L= v * tau.

v=beta c.

Tau= ħ/(Gamma).

So L= beta c * tau= beta c * (ħ/Gamma).

Which is L= (beta c ħ) / Gamma.

Which I calculated as:

(0.9887 *3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV.

Again, GeV cancels.

Compute numerator: 0.9887 *3e8 *6.582e-25.

0.9887 *3e8 =2.9661e8.

2.9661e8 *6.582e-25 = 2.9661 *6.582 *1e-17.

2.9661 *6.582 ≈19.52 →19.52e-17.

Divide by 0.32: 19.52e-17 /0.32=60.9975e-17=6.09975e-16 m.

Same result again.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the width Γ is given in MeV, so perhaps I should use Γ=320 MeV=0.32 GeV, but perhaps the calculation should be made in a different way.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ. Let me double-check the value of ħ.

ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay length formula is L= (c * tau) * beta.

Which is same as before, so same result.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach or see if any of the options can be derived from the given numbers using a different formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula L= c * tau * beta.

But perhaps I should use the mean lifetime, which is tau= ħ/(Gamma).

So, L= c * beta * ħ / Gamma.

Plugging the numbers:

c=3e8 m/s.

Beta≈0.9887.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

L=3e8 * 0.9887 *6.582e-25 / 0.32.

Compute numerator:3e8 *0.9887=2.9661e8.

Multiply by 6.582e-25: 2.9661e8 *6.582e-25= (2.9661 *6.582) * 1e-17.

Which is approximately 19.52 *1e-17=1.952e-16.

Divide by 0.32: 1.952e-16 /0.32=6.099e-16 m.

Same result again.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

Gamma=E/(m c²)=8 GeV / 1.2 GeV=6.66666667.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

1/gamma^2=1/(44.4444444)=0.0225.

So beta= sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Calculating sqrt(0.9775):

Let me compute it using the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me take x0=0.9887.

x0²=0.97752769.

We need x where x²=0.9775.

So f(x)=x²-0.9775.

f(x0)=0.97752769 - 0.9775=0.00002769.

f'(x0)=2x0=1.9774.

Next approximation x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) =0.9887 - (0.00002769)/(1.9774).

0.00002769 /1.9774≈0.000014.

So x1=0.9887 -0.000014=0.988686.

Compute x1²: (0.988686)^2.

0.988686 *0.988686.

Let me compute:

0.988686 *0.988686 = ?

Well, 0.98^2=0.9604.

But more accurately, 0.988686 *0.988686.

Let me compute:

= (0.98 + 0.008686)^2 

= 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.008686 + (0.008686)^2.

= 0.9604 + 0.017093 + 0.0000754.

= 0.9604 + 0.0171684=0.9775684.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

So x1=0.988686 gives x1^2=0.9775684.

We need it to be 0.9775.

So f(x1)=0.9775684 -0.9775=0.0000684.

Wait, that's higher than before. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's best to accept that beta is approximately 0.9887.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of L.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be (6.582e-25 GeV s) * (3e8 m/s) * beta / (0.32 GeV).

Wait, let me compute it again:

6.582e-25 *3e8 = 6.582 * 3e-17 = 19.746e-17.

Multiply by beta (0.9887): 19.746e-17 *0.9887 ≈19.51e-17.

Divide by 0.32: 19.51e-17 /0.32 ≈60.96875e-17 =6.096875e-16 meters.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, so correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the decay length is given by L= (c * tau) * beta.

Which is same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units when converting GeV to other units. Let me make sure.

Wait, the Planck constant ħ is 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. So when Gamma is in GeV, the units are correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option C (5.02e-15) is 10 times larger than my calculation. Did I miss a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait, in the calculation of tau, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 =20.56875e-25 =2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should express 6.582e-25 as 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should use the natural unit system where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation using different unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps using the speed of light as c=2.99792458e8 m/s, which is more precise.

c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

So, v=0.9887 *2.99792458e8 ≈0.9887 *2.99792458e8.

Compute 0.9887 *3e8=2.9661e8 m/s.

But with more precise c, v=0.9887 *2.997925e8 ≈ 2.9659e8 m/s.

So, L=2.9659e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s= ?

Compute 2.9659e8 *2.0568e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.9659 *2.0568 ≈6.100.

So L=6.100e-16 m.

Again, same result.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the decay length formula uses the reduced Planck constant, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay width is given as 320 MeV, which is 3.2e8 eV. Wait, no, 320 MeV is 3.2e8 eV? No, wait: 1 MeV=1e6 eV. So 320 MeV=3.2e8 eV.

Wait, but the Planck constant ħ is in units of GeV·s, which is 1e9 eV·s. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s =6.582e-25 *1e9 eV·s =6.582e-16 eV·s.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute tau using ħ in eV·s.

Tau= ħ/(Gamma).

Gamma=320 MeV=3.2e8 eV.

So tau=6.582e-16 eV·s /3.2e8 eV = (6.582e-16 /3.2e8) s.

6.582e-16 /3.2e8 = (6.582 /3.2) * 1e-24 =2.056875e-24 seconds.

Same as before. So no mistake here.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C:5.0223e-15 m, but that's 10 times larger than my calculation. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when converting GeV to eV.

Wait, when calculating ħ as 6.582e-25 GeV·s, that's correct.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau=6.582e-25 /0.32=2.056875e-24 s.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to pick the closest option, but my calculated value is 6.1e-16, and the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the beta calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct beta is not 0.9887, but something else. Let me re-calculate beta.

Gamma=8/(1.2)=6.66666667.

Beta= sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2))=sqrt(1 -1/44.4444444)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the formula for L is different. Another possibility is that the mean decay length is L= c * tau * gamma beta.

But I thought that was incorrect. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the velocity is v=beta c, and the lifetime is tau. So L= v tau = beta c tau.

Yes, correct.

But perhaps if I consider that gamma is 6.6667, then gamma beta is approximately 6.6667 *0.9887 ≈6.583.

So then L= c * tau * gamma beta.

Wait, that would be 3e8 m/s *2.0568e-24 s *6.583 =3e8 *2.0568e-24 *6.583.

Wait, that would be:

3e8 *6.583=1.9749e9.

Multiply by 2.0568e-24: 1.9749e9 *2.0568e-24=4.065e-15 m.

Ah! That's option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why would I use gamma beta instead of beta? That doesn't make sense. Because velocity is beta c, and tau is the lifetime. So L= v tau= beta c tau.

But wait, maybe I'm confusing between lab frame and rest frame. Alternatively, perhaps I should use gamma beta c tau.

Wait, let me think: The mean decay length is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. In the lab frame, the speed is beta c, and the lifetime is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma. Because in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau, and in the lab frame, it's gamma tau.

Wait, no! Wait a minute, this is a crucial point. The lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So tau_lab= gamma * tau_rest.

Wait, but earlier I used tau= ħ /Gamma, which is actually the proper lifetime, because the width is measured in the rest frame.

So, correct formula:

L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau_rest.

But wait, tau_rest is ħ /Gamma.

So, L= v * gamma * tau_rest.

But v=beta c.

So L= beta c * gamma * tau_rest.

But gamma= E/(m c^2) =8/(1.2)=6.6667.

Beta=0.9887.

Tau_rest= ħ /Gamma=6.582e-25 / 0.32= 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L= beta * gamma * c * tau_rest.

So,

L=0.9887 *6.6667 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute:

0.9887 *6.6667≈6.583.

6.583 *3e8=1.975e9.

1.975e9 *2.056875e-24=1.975e9 *2.056875e-24= (1.975 *2.056875) *1e-15.

1.975 *2.056875 ≈4.065.

So L≈4.065e-15 m.

Which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but earlier I thought that tau_lab=gamma * tau_rest. Because the width Gamma is in the rest frame, so the actual lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the decay width Gamma is measured in the rest frame. So the mean lifetime tau_rest is ħ/Gamma.

But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma: tau_lab= gamma * tau_rest.

Thus, the mean decay length is L= v * tau_lab= beta c * gamma tau_rest.

Which gives L= beta gamma c tau_rest.

Which is what I just did, leading to option B.

So earlier mistake was not considering that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma.

Ah, that's the error. So the correct formula is L= beta gamma c tau_rest.

So now, let me recalculate with that in mind.

So,

beta=0.9887,

gamma=6.6667,

c=3e8 m/s,

tau_rest=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

beta * gamma= 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈6.583.

Then, 6.583 *3e8=1.975e9.

1.975e9 *2.056875e-24=4.065e-15 m.

Which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau \) is the lifetime. The velocity \( v \) is related to the relativistic factor \( \beta \) by \( v = \beta c \), and the lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined by the relativistic factor \( \beta \), where \( \beta = v/c \). The relativistic factor \( \beta \) is related to the total energy \( E \) and the rest mass \( m \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

Given \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \, \text{m}
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
2.966 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 6.100
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 6.100 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using the lab frame lifetime
The lifetime in the lab frame is extended by the relativistic factor \( \gamma \), so:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}}
\]

The corrected formula for \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = \beta c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
L = (0.9887) \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.583
\]

Then:

\[
L = 6.583 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}
\]

\[
L \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
