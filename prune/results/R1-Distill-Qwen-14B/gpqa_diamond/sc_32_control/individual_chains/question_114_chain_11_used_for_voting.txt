Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction uses this product (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it typically undergoes a nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one is a ketone, right? The reaction with NaCN usually gives a cyanohydrin. Wait, a cyanohydrin is when the cyanide adds to the carbonyl group, and then the oxygen gets a proton or something. So the product would have an alcohol group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

But wait, the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would add a CN group and a hydroxyl group to the same carbon. So the product would become (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons, but the structure we're getting is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, the addition would be to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's a four-carbon molecule? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, but here it's more like a three-carbon chain because the starting material is a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile or something. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So the carbonyl is at position 2. When we add NaCN, the CN- will attack the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen will get protonated. Wait, but in the presence of what? Because NaCN is a strong nucleophile, but in what conditions?

Wait, I think that for the formation of a cyanohydrin, you usually need an acid catalyst. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, facilitating the attack by the cyanide. So for the first reaction, reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+.

So in the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and H3O+ (like in a HCN addition). Because without the acid, the reaction might not proceed efficiently. So that would make A = H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Then, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile, and a benzylphenyl group attached. Then, this compound reacts with reagent B in the presence of H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So what's happening here? The nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, they typically form amides or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. But wait, the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile.

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Or in the second reaction, it's a larger molecule. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. But wait, for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, you usually need hydrolysis. But under what conditions?

Nitrile hydrolysis: under acidic conditions, you can get carboxylic acids. But I think that the typical reagents for converting nitriles to carboxylic acids are either strong acid with heat or using a strong acid catalyst like H2SO4 along with water. Alternatively, under basic conditions with something like KMnO4 and heat, you can get the same product.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. Let me think about the reaction.

Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the CN is at the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid, but perhaps via an intermediate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the nitrile is being oxidized. Wait, but oxidation of a nitrile would typically require something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, which is consistent with oxidation.

Wait, but how does the hydroxyl group affect this? Let me think about the structure. The starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a butanenitrile with a substituent. Let me think: butane is four carbons. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH(CH3)2? No, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so 2-position would be the second carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2. Hmm, not sure. But regardless, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid.

But the reaction is in the presence of H2O and reagent B. So possible reagents for this are strong acids or strong bases. If the hydroxyl group is present, perhaps it's a condition that allows for the nitrile to undergo hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

Wait, I think that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using strong acid and heat. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl with H2O and heating.

Looking at the options, reagent B could be HCl (option A and C), or CH3COOH (option B and D).

Wait, but what's the role of the hydroxyl group in the molecule? Since the starting material already has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile, perhaps the reaction conditions need to be such that it doesn't interfere. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process. The nitrile might first be hydrolyzed to an amide or an acid under certain conditions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition, and the second reaction is an oxidation or hydrolysis.

Wait, but the second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. So possible reagents are HCl (as a strong acid) or maybe something else.

In the options, option A is B = HCl. Option C is B = HCl. Option B is B=CH3COOH, D is B=CH3COOH.

Wait, in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B). Then, for the second reaction, what's the reagent? If we're looking for a strong acid, then B would be HCl, which is in options A and C.

So for option A, reagents are A=H3O+, B=HCl. Let's see if that makes sense.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ (acid) would form the cyanohydrin. That's correct.

In the second reaction, the cyanohydrin (the product from the first reaction) is treated with HCl and H2O. So this would be hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Wait, but nitriles are hydrolyzed in acidic conditions to give carboxylic acids. So adding HCl (a strong acid) and water would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. That makes sense.

Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid. Wait, that's a bit strange because that would imply a geminal diol or something. Hmm, wait no. Let me think again. The starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is R-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH2-...? Or maybe it's R-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, when the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, the structure would become R-C(OH)(COOH)-CH2-CH3. But that's not possible because you can't have two hydroxyl groups on the same carbon as the COOH. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the nitrile group is at the end of the chain. Let me clarify the starting material again. The starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. The 2-position is the second carbon from the nitrile. So the structure would be R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CN, but no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is structured as (Ph-C6H4-CH2)-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. So the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group, and then a methyl and a CH2Ph group attached.

Wait, when this is treated with H2O and an acid (like HCl), the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. So the CN becomes COOH, and the OH remains.

So the product would be (Ph-C6H4-CH2)-C(OH)(COOH)-CH2-CH3. But that's a bit of a strange structure, but perhaps it's correct.

Alternatively, the hydroxyl group might be deprotonated and involved in some kind of enol formation, but I think that's complicating things.

So in any case, the second reaction requires acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid. So reagent B must be HCl, which is a strong acid. So looking at the options, reagent B is HCl in options A and C.

But wait, another possibility: the nitrile could be hydrolyzed under basic conditions as well. For example, using NaOH and heat, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, but that's under basic conditions. But in our case, the presence of H2O and another reagent. So if reagent B is HCl (acid), that would fit.

Wait, but what about the first reaction? The product of the first reaction is a cyanohydrin. So for that, we use H3O+ as the acid catalyst. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+. 

So looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl. So if the first reaction needs H3O+, then option A or B are possibilities for A.

Wait, but option B is A=H3O+ and B=CH3COOH. So reagent B would be acetic acid. Could that work?

Wait, what's the role of B in the second reaction? If B is CH3COOH, then it's a weak acid. But nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is usually done under strong acidic or basic conditions. So I'm not sure if a weak acid would suffice. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions, but using a weaker acid.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the second reaction is not a hydrolysis but an oxidation. Because converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically requires oxidation. But NaHSO3 is a reagent that can act as an oxidizing agent under certain conditions. Wait, no, wait. Sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO3) is a source of HSO3^- which is a mild oxidizing agent.

Wait, but in the first reaction, if reagent A is NaHSO3, what would happen? Because NaHSO3 is a strong acid (HSO3^- is a weak base), so it can act as an acid. But for the cyanohydrin formation, we typically use an acid catalyst. So maybe if A is NaHSO3, the HSO3^- would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, and the cyanide would attack. So that could work. Then, in the second reaction, with reagent B.

Wait, but the product of the second reaction is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the nitrile is being oxidized. Wait, oxidation of nitriles requires strong oxidizing agents. For example, KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzed to an amide first, then further oxidized. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis under acidic conditions, which would require a strong acid like HCl.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction uses HCl as the reagent, which provides the acidic conditions for hydrolysis.

So, putting it all together: first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and second reaction uses HCl (so B is HCl). Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But let me check the other option. Another possibility: the second reaction uses a different reagent. Let's think about the structure again.

Wait, the starting material for the second reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when it's treated with H2O and B, which could be an acid, perhaps the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, making the product as given.

So if the second reaction needs acidic conditions, HCl (B) would be correct. So option A would be correct.

Wait, another angle: the product in the first reaction is a cyanohydrin. Then, in the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So that would require a hydrolysis reaction, which is done under acidic or basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is an oxidation. If so, the reagent would be something oxidizing, but the options don't have that. So perhaps it's hydrolysis.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has B=CH3COOH. So if B is acetic acid, would that work? Acetic acid is a weak acid, and perhaps the nitrile hydrolyzes more slowly. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient for the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis under acidic conditions, but the exact conditions would vary. For the first reaction, the correct reagent is H3O+ (so options A and B). But in the second reaction, the correct B is HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (option B and D).

So, between the options, A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. That seems correct.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you would form a ketone? No, wait, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions would typically form an amide or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about converting the nitrile into a carboxylic acid via hydrolysis. For that, strong acid is needed, which would be HCl. So option A's B is HCl.

So the correct options would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → this matches.

So the answer would be option A.

The question involves identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1: 
Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the correct choice for reagent A.

### Reaction 2:
The product from Reaction 1, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B in the presence of H₂O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Since the options do not include a strong base, **HCl** (a strong acid) is the appropriate choice for reagent B to facilitate this reaction.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is the correct catalyst for Reaction 1, and HCl provides the acidic conditions needed for Reaction 2.
  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is insufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in Reaction 2.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for Reaction 1, as it is not typically used as a catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for Reaction 2.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.
