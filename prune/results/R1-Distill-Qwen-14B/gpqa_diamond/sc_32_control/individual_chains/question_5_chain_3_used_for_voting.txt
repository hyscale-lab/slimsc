Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

First, I remember that any vector in the x-z plane can be represented in spherical coordinates. So the direction vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So maybe it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm a bit confused about the exact parametrization. Oh wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so x = r sinθ cosφ, z = r cosθ. But since we're in the x-z plane, φ is zero? Or maybe not, because n is arbitrary. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). Wait, no, because if φ is the angle around the z-axis, then when φ=0, the direction is along the x-axis. But the problem says n is in the x-z plane, so φ can be any angle? No, wait, being in the x-z plane means that the y-component is zero, so the direction is (x,0,z), so yes, φ is zero, and θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, actually, no, because if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then x = sinθ cosφ, z = cosθ. But since n is in the x-z plane, perhaps φ is zero, so x = sinθ*1, z = cosθ.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The operator P is given for each component. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. The problem gives each of these as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think the operator P is a vector operator, so it's P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ's are Pauli matrices. 

Wait, no—the problem gives P_x as (ħ/2) times a matrix, same for P_y and P_z. So each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So the operator for P in the direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction vector n is a unit vector. So n_x and n_z are the components, but since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Alternatively, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, with θ being the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no, the direction vector n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (a, 0, b), with a² + b² = 1. So a = n_x, b = n_z. So the operator P along n is P = (a P_x) + (b P_z), because P_y is zero here.

So substituting the given matrices:

P = a * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + b * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So combining the terms, that's (ħ/2) times the matrix:

[[b, a],
 [a, -b]]

So the matrix form of the operator P along n is (ħ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]].

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Substituting P, we have (ħ/2) [[b, a],[a, -b]] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[[b, a],[a, -b]] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [b, a], [a, -b] ] * [x; y] = [x; y]

Wait, let me denote the eigenvector as a column vector (x, y). So we have the equations:

b x + a y = x  
a x - b y = y

Let me write these two equations:

1) (b - 1)x + a y = 0  
2) a x + (-b - 1)y = 0

This is a homogeneous system, and we're looking for non-trivial solutions. So the determinant of the coefficients should be zero.

The coefficient matrix is:

[ (b-1) a     ]  
[ a ( -b-1 ) ]

So determinant is (b-1)(-b-1) - a^2 = 0

Wait, but since a² + b² = 1 (because n is a unit vector), perhaps I can use that. Let's compute the determinant:

(b-1)(-b -1) = -(b-1)(b+1) = -(b² -1) = -( (a² + b²) -1 ) because a² + b²=1, so this becomes -(1 -1)=0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's compute it properly.

Wait, (b-1)(-b-1) = (-b)(b) + (-b)(-1) + (-1)(b) + (-1)(-1) = -b² + b -b +1 = -b² +1.

So determinant is [ (b-1)(-b-1) - a^2 ] = (-b² +1) - a².

But since a² + b² =1, 1 = a² + b². So substituting into the determinant:

(-b² + (a² + b²)) - a² = (-b² + a² + b²) - a² = a² - a² = 0.

So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for an eigenvector.

So the two equations are consistent. Let me take equation 1):

(b -1) x + a y = 0  
=> (1 - b) x = a y  
=> y = [ (1 - b) / a ] x

But wait, because a^2 + b^2 =1, which might help. Let's express it in terms of θ. Since n is in x-z plane, let me parameterize it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so a = sinθ, b = cosθ.

So y = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] x.

Let me simplify (1 - cosθ)/sinθ. I remember that (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] ] = [sin(θ/2)] / [cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So y = tan(θ/2) x.

So the eigenstate is proportional to [x; y] = [x; tan(θ/2) x] = x [1; tan(θ/2)].

We can write this as (1, tan(θ/2)) multiplied by x. But we need a normalized eigenvector.

The normalization condition is |x|^2 + |y|^2 =1. So |x|^2 [1 + tan²(θ/2)] =1.

But 1 + tan² = sec², so |x|^2 * sec²(θ/2) =1 → |x|^2 = cos²(θ/2). Therefore, x = cos(θ/2), and y = sin(θ/2), but wait, let's see.

Wait, if x is real, then y = tan(θ/2) x, so x = cos(θ/2), y = sin(θ/2). Because:

tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) → y = [sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2)] * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvector can have a phase factor. So the general form is (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)). Because when you have spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor, especially for the spin state.

Wait, but the problem says the eigenvector is normalized. So, let's check. The length squared is cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) =1, so that's good.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is different.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but the problem is about the operator P along n. Wait, perhaps I messed up the parametrization. Let me think again.

In the standard spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of S·n (where n is a unit vector) are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, and |-> similarly. Since we're dealing with eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But in our case, n is in the x-z plane, which means phi is zero (since it's along x and z). So phi is zero. So the eigenvector simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, so in the problem statement, the eigenvector for P·n is the same as the spin-up state along n, which is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

But the options given: option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Hmm, but in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi would be zero, so the phase factor is 1, making the second component purely real. Or wait, no, because in the problem statement, n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi could be any value. Wait, no: n is in the x-z plane, so the direction is (a, 0, b), implying that phi is zero. So the angle is theta from the z-axis, and phi is zero. So the state would have no phase factor because e^{i phi} is 1.

Wait, but the problem says "arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So phi can be any value, but wait, n is in the x-z plane, which would imply that phi is zero. Because in spherical coordinates, phi is the angle around the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero or 180 degrees. Hmm, but the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so phi could be zero, but for generality, perhaps the state still has the phase factor. Wait, but that might complicate things because the operator's components are given with real matrices. Wait, no, the P_y matrix has an imaginary component. So perhaps the eigenvectors can have complex components.

Wait, but going back to the problem, the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would have a different parametrization. But our solution is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively.

Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]. So that aligns with option C. But the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which is correct for the spin-up state.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But let me double-check the operator to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The operator P along n is (ħ/2) [ [b, a], [a, -b] ] where a² + b² =1.

The eigenvalue equation is [ [b, a], [a, -b] ] [x; y] = [x; y].

So, the equations are:

(b-1)x + a y =0  
a x + (-b-1) y =0.

From first equation: (1 - b) x = a y → y = [ (1 - b)/a ] x.

But since a² + b² =1, perhaps we can express (1 - b) in terms of a.

Wait, let me compute (1 - b):

1 - b = 1 - cosθ, because b = cosθ.

And a = sinθ.

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = tan(theta/2).

So y = [ (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ ] x = tan(theta/2) x.

So the eigenvector is (x, tan(theta/2) x) = x (1, tan(theta/2)).

But to normalize, we have x^2 [1 + tan^2(theta/2)] =1 → x^2 = 1/(1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = cos^2(theta/2).

So x= cos(theta/2), y= sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, but option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors. Why would that be?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction vector. Wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, but perhaps the components are normalized differently. Let me think: the direction vector n can be written as (a, 0, b), with a² + b² =1, and a = sinθ, b=cosθ. So the operator P along n is (ħ/2)( a σ_x + b σ_z ), where σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the matrix is (ħ/2) [ [b, a], [a, -b] ].

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, we found the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector, not the spinor. So looking back at the options, let's check:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → that's a different parametrization, perhaps for a different state.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → that's exactly what we found.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) → includes hbar, but we have normalized the eigenvector, so the components should be dimensionless. So option D seems incorrect because it includes hbar, which isn't part of the eigenvector's components. Because the problem asks for the normalized eigenvector, which should have components without any units. So option D seems incorrect.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) → units again, and it's fixed numbers, which doesn't match our parametrization.

So the correct answer must be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction vector $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, and using $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}$, this becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)x + \sin\theta y = 0, \quad \sin\theta x + (-\cos\theta - 1)y = 0
\]
The second equation is redundant, so we focus on the first:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)x + \sin\theta y = 0
\]
Solving for $y$, we find:
\[
y = \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} x
\]
Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we simplify:
\[
y = \tan(\theta/2) x
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
= x 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
\tan(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
To normalize, we impose:
\[
|x|^2 + |y|^2 = 1
\]
Substituting $y = \tan(\theta/2) x$, we get:
\[
x^2 \left(1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)\right) = 1
\]
Using $1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) = \sec^2(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
x = \cos(\theta/2), \quad y = \sin(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — Incorrect, as the eigenvector depends on $\theta$ and is not fixed.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different parametrization.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — Correct, matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary normalization factors and includes $\hbar$, which is not part of the normalized eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
