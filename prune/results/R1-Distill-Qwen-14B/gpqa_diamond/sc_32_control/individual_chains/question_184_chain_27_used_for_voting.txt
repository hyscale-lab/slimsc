Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, I need to figure out the sequence of reactions starting from benzene. Let me draw that structure. Benzene ring with substituents: at position 1 (which is the same as position para, but wait, wait, no. Wait, the numbering here is important. Let me clarify.

So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 1, 2, 3 would be adjacent positions. Let's see: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Hmm, that would mean that the substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other?

Wait, no, let's draw it. Let's number the benzene ring. Let's imagine the ring as follows: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So if ethoxy is at position 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Then 2 has t-butyl, and position 3 (which is adjacent to 2) has nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are in a meta arrangement for the ethoxy and nitro, but t-butyl is adjacent to ethoxy.

Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row. So that would mean ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So ethoxy is next to t-butyl, which is next to nitro. So the three substituents are in a sort of 1, 2, 3 arrangement. Hmm, but that's like a row of three substituents, which might be a bit crowded, but possible.

So the plan is to start with benzene and add these substituents in some order. Remember that the order of substitution matters because of directing effects.

First, I need to think about the directing effects of each functional group. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions.

The substituents present in the target molecule are:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating ether. It's an ortho/para director.

- t-butyl group (C(CH2CH3)3): This is a strong activating group because it's a bulky alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para directors.

- Nitro group (NO2): This is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group. It's a meta director.

Now, the challenge is to add these groups in an order that allows each subsequent substitution to occur in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

But wait, the target molecule has three substituents. So, we have to perform three substitution reactions. Let's think about the order of adding these groups.

Option 1: Add the nitro group first. Nitro is meta directing. But wait, if we add nitro first, then the next substitution (like ethoxy) would be directed by nitro, which is meta. Hmm, but let me think.

Wait, benzene is the starting material. Suppose we first nitrate benzene. That would give nitrobenzene. Then, when adding another group, since nitro is meta-directing, the next substituent would tend to go to the meta position relative to nitro. But let's think about where we want the other groups.

Wait, the target has ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively. So the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2.

Let me think about the order. Let's say we add the ethoxy group first. Then, ethoxy is an activating group, so it directs incoming substituents to ortho and para. But where the nitro and t-butyl are, in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. Hmm, that might not be favorable because ethoxy is an ortho/para director. So if we add nitro next, it would go into meta, which would be okay if ethoxy is in position 1, then nitro would go to position 3. Then adding t-butyl next would have to go to position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy. Since t-butyl is activating, perhaps it could be added in another step.

Alternatively, adding the t-butyl first. Let's see. If we first do Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride, using AlCl3 as a catalyst. Friedel-Crafts adds alkyl groups. The t-butyl group is a strong activating group, so next substitution would be directed by t-butyl. So, ethoxy and nitro would be added in the next steps.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group. Adding nitro after t-butyl would be tricky because nitro is meta-directing. Let me think about the order.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group last, because adding nitro is a deactivating step, which would make further substitution harder. So maybe adding the ethoxy and t-butyl first, and then nitro.

Wait, but where would the nitro go? Let me think.

Another approach: Let's think about the reaction steps. Each substituent is added via a substitution reaction. The order is important because each step's directing effect depends on the current substituents.

Let's outline the possible steps.

Option A: Suppose we add the t-butyl group first. So benzene → (AlCl3, tert-butyl chloride) → t-butylbenzene. Then, next substitution is nitration. Nitration would be directed by t-butyl, which is an activating, ortho/para director. So nitro would go into ortho or para to t-butyl. Let's say we choose para. So nitro would be at position 4 relative to t-butyl (assuming t-butyl is at position 1). Wait, no. Let's number the ring: if t-butyl is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are ortho, and 4 is para. So nitration would occur at position 4 or 2.

Then, after nitration, we have t-butyl at 1 and nitro at 4. Now, we need to add ethoxy at position 2. But wait, position 2 is ortho to t-butyl (position 1) and meta to nitro (position 4). So which group would direct the ethoxy?

Wait, aromatic substitution is directed by all substituents present. So in this case, when we add ethoxy, the substituents already present are t-butyl and nitro.

t-butyl is activating (ortho/para), nitro is deactivating (meta). So the incoming ethoxy group would be directed by which group? Well, the most strongly activating group would have more influence. So t-butyl is a strong activating group, so perhaps it would direct the next substituent (ethoxy) to ortho or para to itself.

But in this scenario, we've already added nitro to position 4. So, when adding ethoxy, where would it go? The existing substituents are t-butyl at 1 and nitro at 4.

Wait, let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions 1: t-butyl

Positions 4: nitro

So the ring looks like:

1: t-butyl

2: H

3: H

4: nitro

5: H

6: H

Now, adding ethoxy. The ethoxy will be directed by both substituents. The t-butyl is at 1, which is strongly activating and directs ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4, which is already occupied). Nitro at 4 is deactivating and directs meta, which would be positions 1,3,5,7... but 7 isn't on the ring. So position 3 relative to nitro at 4 is position 7, but that's not possible. Wait, for a benzene ring, each substituent directs to relative positions.

Alternatively, the nitro at position 4 would direct the incoming group to position 1 (already t-butyl), 3, or 5.

But the t-butyl at 1 directs to 2 and 6. So the ethoxy would have to choose between positions 2,6 (directed by t-butyl) and 3,5 (directed by nitro). But if t-butyl is a stronger director, perhaps the ethoxy would go to position 2 or 6.

So if the ethoxy goes to position 2, then that's adjacent to t-butyl (position1). Then, the substituents would be:

1: t-butyl

2: ethoxy

4: nitro

So the ring now has three substituents: t-butyl at 1, ethoxy at 2, nitro at4. But the target has nitro at 3. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe that approach isn't correct. Let me try a different order.

Alternative approach: Let's try adding ethoxy first. So benzene → ethoxybenzene via, say, ethylation (but how? Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation is possible with ethyl chloride and AlCl3. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation can be tricky with small alkyl groups like ethyl because they tend to form carbocations that can rearrange or not form properly. Alternatively, perhaps using another method, but maybe for the sake of this problem, I can assume that ethoxy is added via a substitution, perhaps using something like an electrophilic substitution with ethyl sulfate or another suitable reagent.

Wait, but typically, to introduce an ethoxy group, you might do an alkylation of benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nitration followed by some other steps, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced last. Let's think.

Alternatively, what if the nitro group is added first? Let's see.

Benzene → nitrated → nitrobenzene.

Then, nitro is a meta director, so the next substitution would go to meta to nitro.

So, say we then add ethoxy. Since nitro is a meta director, ethoxy would go to position 3 or 5 (if nitro is at position 1). Wait, let's number the ring: Let's say nitro is at position 1. Then, possible positions for ethoxy would be 3 and 5 (meta to 1). Suppose ethoxy is added to position 3.

Then, the ring has nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3. Now, we need to add t-butyl. The existing groups are nitro (deactivating, meta) and ethoxy (activating, ortho/para). So where would the t-butyl go?

The t-butyl would probably be directed by ethoxy, which is activating and ortho/para. So possible positions are 2, 4, or 6 relative to ethoxy at 3.

Wait, let me imagine the ring again:

Nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3.

So, the substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, adding t-butyl. The ethoxy at 3 directs to ortho (2 and 4) and para (6). Nitro at 1 directs to meta, which would be positions 4, 6, but considering it's already at 1, meta would be positions 3,5,7 (but 7 isn't on the ring). So maybe nitro doesn't influence much here.

So, if the t-butyl is added next, it's more likely to go to position 2 or 4, directed by ethoxy.

Suppose it goes to position 2. Then, the substituents would be nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3, t-butyl at 2.

Wait, that's position 2 adjacent to ethoxy at 3, and position 1 (nitro) is adjacent to position 2. So the structure would have substituents at 1, 2, 3: nitro, t-butyl, ethoxy. But that's the same as the target but in a different order. Wait, the target is 1-ethoxy, 2-t-butyl, 3-nitro. So if the substituents are at 1 (nitro), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (ethoxy), that's different from the target.

Hmm, perhaps the order is not nitro first.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to add the t-butyl first. Then, add the nitro group, and then the ethoxy.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's outline each possible option from the given choices.

Looking at the options, each option lists a sequence of reactions. Each reaction is a step, and the options are from A to D.

Let me look at the options:

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation? Wait, step ii is HNO3, which is nitration. Then step iii is SO3, which is sulfonation.

Wait, the option as written is a bit confusing. Let me parse each option correctly.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl, AlCl3 → adds t-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis (maybe of a diazonium salt).

vii) NaOH, EtBr → perhaps an SN2 substitution? Ethoxy group via Williamson? Wait, but that's more for ethers.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe a还原 step, like a Clemmensen or something else.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl, AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl, AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe acid workup.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

iii) t-BuCl, AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

Wait, perhaps the order of reactions can tell us the correct sequence.

Each option is a sequence of reactions. So for the target molecule, what are the necessary steps?

First, I think the steps likely involve:

1. Adding t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

2. Then nitrating, but the position depends on the directing group.

3. Then introducing the ethoxy group.

But wait, another approach is to add ethoxy via another method, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, maybe via a diazonium salt.

Wait, but benzene rings are generally electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkylation, perhaps using an ethyl halide with a strong Lewis acid catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps you can introduce the ethoxy group via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups on the ring which make it susceptible to such reactions.

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group, so adding it via electrophilic substitution would be more likely.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after another group has been added which makes the ring more activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction using a good leaving group, but benzene itself doesn't have that. So perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkyl halide in the presence of a catalyst, like AlCl3, similar to Friedel-Crafts.

But Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically adds alkyl groups. So ethyl chloride with AlCl3 could add an ethyl group. Wait, but the target has ethoxy group, not ethyl. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction where a good leaving group is present. For example, if a tosylate group is attached, it can be replaced by an ethoxide. But how would that group be added in the first place?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a SN2 substitution after a nitration or sulfonation step.

Alternatively, perhaps a diazonium salt is used. For example, in the case of a diazonium salt substitution, which can be used to introduce substituents.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again about the target molecule.

The target is 2-(t-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro).

So, the substituents are 1, 2, 3 in order.

So the arrangement is:

Position 1: ethoxy

Position 2: t-butyl

Position 3: nitro

So, perhaps the order of adding substituents is:

1. Add t-butyl group (position 2).

2. Then nitro group (position 3).

3. Then ethoxy group (position 1).

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think.

If we start with benzene, add t-butyl (Friedel-Crafts), then nitrate. The t-butyl is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur ortho or para to it.

Wait, in benzene with t-butyl, when you nitrate, the nitro group would go to ortho or para.

If I want nitro to end up at position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl (position 2), then nitro would have to be in the ortho position relative to t-butyl.

So, if t-butyl is at position 2, nitro could go to position 1 or 3 (ortho positions).

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, so if nitro is added to position 3, that's adjacent to t-butyl at 2. Then, after nitration, we have t-butyl at 2 and nitro at 3. Then, adding ethoxy.

But ethoxy is an activating group; where would it go? The ring now has t-butyl (position 2, activating, ortho/para) and nitro (position 3, deactivating, meta).

So the next substitution (ethoxy) would be directed by the existing groups. The activating groups have a stronger influence.

So, the ethoxy would be directed by t-butyl. Since t-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy would go to position 1 (ortho) or 3 (but 3 is already occupied by nitro) or position 6 (para to 2). So ethoxy could go to position 1 or 6.

If it goes to position 1, that would give the target structure. So, the order would be:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro (ortho to t-butyl, which would be position 3).

3. Add ethoxy (ortho to t-butyl, which is position 1).

But wait, after adding nitro at 3, the ring has substituents at 2 (t-butyl) and 3 (nitro). Then, adding ethoxy would be directed by t-butyl (activating) and nitro (deactivating). The t-butyl would direct to ortho and para, so position 1 and 6 would be possibilities. If ethoxy goes to position 1, that's our target.

So the sequence would be:

- Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-butylbenzene.

- Nitration → nitro group added para to t-butyl? No, wait, t-butyl is at position 2. Nitration would go to ortho and para. So ortho would be positions 1 and 3. If we want nitro at position 3, we need to make sure that's where it goes.

Wait, but when a strong activating group like t-butyl is present, the nitration would occur at ortho or para. So, t-butyl at position 2 would direct to positions 1 (ortho), 3 (meta?), wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the ring.

Imagine t-butyl is at position 2. The ring is numbered as follows:

Positions:

1  2  3

6     4

5

Wait, no, benzene numbering is such that each substituent is assigned the lowest possible number. But for a meta arrangement, the numbering would have substituents at 1, 3,5. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should imagine the benzene ring with t-butyl at position 2. Then, the possible positions for nitration would be ortho (1 and 3) and para (4).

So, if nitration occurs, it would add nitro at position 1, 3, or 4.

If we want nitro at position 3, that's possible. So after adding t-butyl, nitration would add nitro at 3.

Then, the ring has t-butyl at 2 and nitro at 3. Now, adding ethoxy. The current substituents are t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So the next substituent would be directed by the activating group, which is t-butyl.

t-butyl at 2 would direct ethoxy to ortho (positions 1 and 3) or para (position 6). But position 3 is already occupied by nitro. So options are 1 or 6. If ethoxy goes to 1, that's our target.

So the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-BuCl, AlCl3) → t-butyl at 2.

2. Nitration → nitro at 3.

3. Friedel-Crafts ethoxylation? Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for adding ether groups.

Ah, right. Adding an ethoxy group would require a different approach. Perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's more involved and requires specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is present. But benzene is not a good nucleophile; perhaps we have to create a good leaving group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution of a tosyl group. For example, if a tosyl group is attached to the ring, it can be replaced by an ethoxide ion under basic conditions.

But how would we get the tosyl group onto the ring in the first place?

Tosylation typically involves substituting a hydrogen with a tosyl group, which can be done via an electrophilic substitution. So, to get a tosyl group at position 1, perhaps after adding the t-butyl and nitro groups, we can tosylate at position 1, then substitute with ethoxide.

But that requires that position 1 is activated enough for tosylation.

Wait, but after adding t-butyl and nitro groups, the ring may have certain activating and deactivating effects. So, let me think about the step after nitration.

After step 2, the ring has t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So, position 1 is ortho to t-butyl, para to nothing, but meta to nitro.

Is position 1 activated enough for another substitution? Since t-butyl is activating, position 1 would be activated, so tosyl chloride could add there.

So step 3: Tosyl chloride in presence of a base → tosyl group added at position 1.

Then, step 4: treatment with ethoxide (from NaOH and ethanol) would substitute the tosyl group with ethoxy.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact steps, but let's see.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-butyl at 2.

2. Nitration → nitro at 3.

3. Tosylation → tosyl group at 1.

4. Substitution with ethoxide → ethoxy at 1.

But looking at the options provided, I don't see such a sequence. The options provided involve steps like HNO3, SO3, NaNO2, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a diazonium salt. For example, after nitration, forming a diazonium salt and then substituting with ethoxide.

Wait, but that would require a nitro group to be in a position that can be converted into a diazonium salt, which usually involves amines. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's beyond basic organic chemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an SN2 substitution after introducing a good leaving group, but I'm not sure how that would happen on the benzene ring.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation and then reduction, but that would give a methyl group, not an ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution using a strong base, but that's more common in aliphatic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution using a Grignard reagent. But Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups, not directly to benzene rings.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's instead look at the options given to see which sequence matches the necessary steps.

Looking back at the target molecule, we need to add three substituents: t-butyl, nitro, and ethoxy. The order of addition will determine the positions.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine → phenylamine.

iii) t-BuCl, AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-butyl to benzene ring. Wait, but after reduction, the ring has an amine group, which is a strong activating group (NH2 is ortho/para director).

So if we do Friedel-Crafts after adding amine, that might not be possible because Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated, but the amine is already a strong activator. However, Friedel-Crafts is usually done on rings without strong deactivating groups. Wait, but if the ring has an amine, which is an activating group, then Friedel-Crafts could proceed. So adding t-butyl in this step would be possible.

After step iii, we have t-butyl and NH2 groups.

Then, iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. But now, the ring has t-butyl (activating) and amine (activating). The nitration would be directed by both. Which would dominate?

Amine is a stronger activating group than alkyl groups. So the nitration would be directed by the amine group, which is ortho/para. So the nitro group would go ortho or para to NH2. But the target has nitro in position 3, which may or may not correspond.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't leading to the correct structure.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl, AlCl3 → t-butyl added.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at ortho or para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a hydroxyl group? Or another substitution).

vii) NaOH, EtBr → perhaps to substitute a leaving group with ethoxy.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → maybe acid workup.

Hmm, this seems too convoluted. Let me think about which option correctly adds the groups in the right order and positions.

Another approach: Let's think about each step in each option.

Option D:

Steps:

1. Nitration → nitro group added.

2. Reduction (Fe/HCl) → nitro → amine.

3. Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl.

4. Nitration → another nitro group.

But this would give two nitro groups, which isn't the case in the target (only one nitro group). So option D is unlikely.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) SO3 → sulfonate.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolyze diazo to something (maybe to amine or hydroxyl).

vii) NaOH, EtBr → substitution (maybe via SN2).

viii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate again.

This seems too many steps and not necessarily leading to the target.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

So, after adding t-butyl, sulfonate group is added via SO3. Then nitrate, reduce, etc. It's not clear if this would lead to the correct substituents.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

Again, this seems to involve multiple nitrations and reductions, which may not fit the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think:

Option C's steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate. Now, the ring has t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta). The nitration would be directed by the strongest director. The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, so nitration would be directed meta to it.

Wait, but after adding t-butyl and sulfonate, the next group would be nitro. Let me imagine the positions.

t-butyl at position 2.

sulfonate at position, say, 5 (if added meta to t-butyl? Or perhaps position 4, depending on where SO3 is added.)

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.

Let me think about the nitro group. The target has only one nitro group, so any steps involving nitration should only add one nitro.

Looking back, the target molecule has the nitro group at position 3. So, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, no, because nitro is a deactivating group, which would make further substitution difficult. So perhaps the nitro is added after the t-butyl but before the ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about what each reaction step does.

Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-BuCl, AlCl3): adds t-butyl group.

Nitration (HNO3, H2SO4): adds nitro group.

Sulfonation (SO3, H2SO4): adds sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta director.

Diazotization (NaNO2, HCl, cold): converts aromatic amine to diazonium salt.

Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O, heat): can convert diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.

SN2 substitution (NaOH, EtBr): perhaps substitutes a bromide with OH, but more likely, it's a Williamson-type ether synthesis, using an alkyl halide and a base to form an ether.

Reduction (Fe/HCl): reduces nitro groups to amine, or perhaps removes functional groups.

So, looking for the steps that would add the groups in the correct order.

Let me outline the correct steps based on my earlier analysis.

1. Add t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate, adding nitro group ortho to t-butyl (position 3).

3. Add ethoxy group ortho to t-butyl (position 1).

But how is the ethoxy group added? Probably via another Friedel-Crafts, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps via a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkylation using an ethyl halide in the presence of a base.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but that's beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced by converting a nitro group to an amine, then to a diazonium salt, and then substituting with ethoxide.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Nitrate to add nitro.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize amine to diazonium salt.

5. Hydrolyze diazonium salt to hydroxyl group.

6. Substitute hydroxyl group with ethoxy.

But that seems like a lot of steps, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group via a substitution.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy, which is an activating group. So, in the correct sequence, the nitro must be added before the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Nitrate to add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But how? Friedel-Crafts can't be used for adding ethoxy; perhaps a substitution is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after introducing a good leaving group.

Wait, but again, this is getting too complicated, and I'm not finding a clear path.

Perhaps I should look for the correct order of substituents.

The target is 2-t-butyl, 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro.

So, substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro).

The order of addition should be such that each group directs the next correctly.

Another approach: The ethoxy group is an activating group, which is ortho/para directing. So, if it's added early, it would direct subsequent groups. But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, and the nitro is at position 3. So, if the ethoxy is added before nitro, then the nitro would be directed by ethoxy, which is ortho/para. So nitro would be at position 2 or 4.

But the target has nitro at 3, which is meta to ethoxy. So that suggests that the nitro must have been added before the ethoxy.

Wait, so perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro, which is directed by t-butyl to position 3.

3. Add ethoxy, which is directed by t-butyl to position 1.

So the sequence is t-butyl, nitro, ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro? Because nitro is deactivating, making the ring less reactive, but the t-butyl is still activating.

So, after adding t-butyl and nitro, the ring has t-butyl (activating) and nitro (deactivating). The ethoxy would be added in a position directed by the activating group, which is t-butyl. So ethoxy could go to position 1 or 6.

If it goes to position 1, that's correct.

So the steps are:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl.

2. Nitration to add nitro.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add ethoxy? Wait, but ethoxy isn't an alkyl group. Alternatively, perhaps an alkylation to add ethyl group, then convert to ethoxy.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct sequence is:

t-BuCl → nitration → ... → ethoxy.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again, which seems odd.

Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

So, this would add nitro, then amine, then t-butyl, then another nitro. Not matching the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is in option B.

Option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

But again, this seems to involve multiple nitrations, which would add more nitro groups than desired.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible positions after each step.

Assuming the correct order is t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Nitrate.

3. Add ethoxy.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which option follows this order.

Looking at option A:

Steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) SO3 → sulfonate.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

But this adds SO3 after nitration, which would add a sulfonate group. But the target doesn't have a sulfonate group, so option A is unlikely.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

So, this adds two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

So, again, multiple nitrations, which doesn't fit.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

So, adding two nitro groups, which isn't correct.

Hmm. None of the options seem to directly match the order I thought, which is t-butyl, nitro, ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added before the nitro. But that would require the nitro to be meta to ethoxy, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl at 2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The nitro group is added last, and the ethoxy and t-butyl are added first.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

But then, after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, where would the nitro go?

Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para), t-butyl is activating (ortho/para). So nitro would be directed to a position ortho or para to both.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl at 2 and ethoxy at 1.

Hmm, perhaps this is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → add nitro group.

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Add t-butyl group.

But then, the nitro group would be deactivating, making the ring less reactive. Adding ethoxy and t-butyl after nitro may not be feasible.

But let me consider option B again.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at ortho or para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again → adds another nitro group.

Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial nitration is the one that adds the nitro group, and the next nitration is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the directing effects again.

If we have t-butyl and ethoxy already on the ring, where would the nitro group go? It would go to a position that is ortho or para to both.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1).

So, perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy and t-butyl.

But nitration is a meta director for nitro, which would be difficult if the ring has activating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence in the options will help.

Looking for the steps:

Adding t-butyl first (Friedel-Crafts), then nitrating, then adding ethoxy.

So, in the options, which one has Friedel-Crafts first, then nitration, then another Friedel-Crafts for ethoxy? But none of the options have that, so perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution.

Wait, looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis to something.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → substitution to add ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, after step i, we have t-butyl at position 2.

Step ii: SO3 → sulfonate. Where would the sulfonate group go? It would be directed by t-butyl, which is activating and ortho/para. So sulfonate could go to position 1, 3, or 6.

If it goes to position 1, then step iii: nitration would be directed by both t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonate (deactivating, meta).

So, the nitration would be directed by t-butyl, so nitro could go to position 3 (ortho to t-butyl) or position 6 (para to t-butyl).

Assuming it goes to position 3, then step iv: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine.

Step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

Step vi: HNO3 → nitrate again (but nitration again after reduction? That would add another nitro group. Maybe not the case.)

Alternatively, perhaps after the diazo, hydrolysis occurs. So step vi: H3O+/H2O, heat → hydrolysis of diazo to hydroxyl group.

Then, step ix: NaOH, EtBr → substitution of bromide with ethoxy.

Wait, but where would the bromide be? Unless another substitution step is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via an SN2 reaction where a bromide is present. But I'm not seeing where the bromide comes from.

I think I'm getting stuck on the details. Maybe I should look for the correct option based on the order of substituents.

The target has substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro). So the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

Looking for a sequence where after adding t-butyl and nitro, the ethoxy is added in the correct position.

Which option does that?

Looking at option B:

After adding t-butyl and nitro, perhaps the ethoxy is added via substitution.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group is added first, then t-butyl, then ethoxy.

But nitro is deactivating, so adding t-butyl after nitro would be difficult because nitro makes the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But maybe possible with very strong activating groups.

So steps:

1. Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl. But where? Nitro is meta director, so t-butyl would be added at position 3 or 5.

3. Then add ethoxy, which would be directed by t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) or nitro (deactivating, meta).

If t-butyl is at position 3, ethoxy would go to 2 or 4 (ortho/para to t-butyl). If that's the case, then substituents would be at 1 (nitro), 3 (t-butyl), 2 (ethoxy). That's not the target.

So this order is unlikely.

Hmm.

Another approach: let's think about the presence of the nitro group. Since nitro is a meta director, the substituents around it would be placed meta to it.

In the target, nitro is at 3. So the ethoxy is at 1, which is meta to nitro (because nitro is at 3, the meta positions would be 6 and 0, but wait, benzene is cyclic, so the meta positions for nitro at 3 would be 6 and 0. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But earlier analysis suggested that nitro would end up in the wrong position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Looking back, perhaps option C is the correct sequence.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the correct structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the correct order again.

The target's substituents are:

1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3)

2: t-butyl (C(CH3)3)

3: nitro (NO2)

So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3.

So, the order of addition should be such that each substituent is added in a position directed by the already present substituents.

One possible order is:

1. Add ethoxy (OCH2CH3) → position 1.

2. Add t-butyl → position 2 (directed by ethoxy, which is ortho/para).

3. Add nitro → position 3 (directed by t-butyl, which is ortho, or by ethoxy, which would be meta).

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group, so nitro would be directed by ethoxy to ortho or para, which would be positions 2 and 6.

But the target has nitro at 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl at 2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

So, after t-butyl and ethoxy are added, nitro would go to a position directed by both. But I'm not certain.

But in this case, the nitro would be directed by t-butyl (ortho/para) and ethoxy (ortho/para).

So, possible positions are 3 or 6.

If it goes to 3, that's correct.

So, the steps would be:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) Friedel-Crafts ethoxylation → add ethoxy.

But I don't see a Friedel-Crafts step for adding ethoxy in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution, but how?

Looking at the options, option B includes steps after t-butyl and nitration.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again → adds another nitro, which is not desired.

So, option B is probably incorrect.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate → adds nitro again.

But again, this adds two nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

But this sequence adds multiple nitro groups.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct order is to add t-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy. Looking at the options, none seem to directly match this, but option B might. Alternatively, option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let me re-examine.

Option B steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate → where would this go? The ring now has t-butyl (activating) and amine (activating). Nitration would be directed by the more activating group, which is amine. So nitro would go ortho or para to amine.

But the target has only one nitro, so this step doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Another approach: the target has a nitro group, which is deactivating, so it must be added after the activating groups.

Therefore, the nitro should be added last.

So the steps would be:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add nitro after ethoxy and t-butyl. Nitro is a meta director.

So, after adding t-butyl and ethoxy, the nitro would be directed to a position meta to both, or ortho/para to one and meta to another.

But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-butyl at 2 and meta to ethoxy at 1.

So, perhaps the nitro is added last, directed by t-butyl.

So, the steps would be:

i) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

ii) Friedel-Crafts to add ethoxy → but ethoxy isn't an alkyl group; perhaps via another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after nitration.

Hmm. I think I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on the target structure, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy at 1 and ortho to t-butyl at 2. So, the nitro must have been added after t-butyl, which is activating, so the nitro would be directed by t-butyl to ortho or para.

So, perhaps the correct order is t-butyl → nitro → ethoxy.

Looking for a sequence where after adding t-butyl and nitro, ethoxy is added.

In the options, option C has steps:

i) t-BuCl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

So, after t-butyl and sulfonate, nitro is added. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option B:

i) t-BuCl.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) HNO3 → another nitro.

Not helpful.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution where a leaving group is present. For example, if a nitro group is present, perhaps under certain conditions it can be replaced.

But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkylation using an ethyl halide in presence of a base after the nitro group is present.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

After all this, I think the correct option is option B. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, looking at option C, the steps after adding t-butyl and sulfonate lead to nitration, which could place nitro in the correct position.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, maybe option D is the correct one. Let me read it again.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

But this adds two nitro groups, which is not the target.

Hmm.

I think the correct answer is option B.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has three substituents, so we need three substitution reactions.

Looking at the options, they all have 9 steps, which seems excessive, but perhaps some steps are for other purposes, like protection or deprotection.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll have to go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The synthesis must involve adding these substituents in an order that ensures each step is directed correctly by the existing groups on the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of Substituent Effects:
1. **Ethoxy Group (OCH₂CH₃):** An activating group (electron-donating) and an ortho/para director.
2. **tert-Butyl Group (C(CH₃)₃):** A strongly activating group (electron-donating) and an ortho/para director.
3. **Nitro Group (NO₂):** A deactivating group (electron-withdrawing) and a meta director.

### Correct Order of Addition:
- **Step 1:** Add the tert-butyl group first via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This group strongly activates the ring and directs subsequent substituents to ortho and para positions.
- **Step 2:** Add the nitro group. The tert-butyl group directs the nitro group to an ortho position, placing it at position 3.
- **Step 3:** Add the ethoxy group. The tert-butyl group continues to direct the ethoxy group to an ortho position, placing it at position 1.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes steps like sulfonation (SO₃) and diazotization (NaNO₂), which are unnecessary for the target molecule. Additionally, it introduces multiple functional groups that do not align with the target structure.
- **Option B:** 
  1. Adds the tert-butyl group first (i).
  2. Nitrates the ring, placing the nitro group ortho to the tert-butyl group (ii).
  3. Reduces the nitro group to an amine (iii), which is not needed for the target molecule.
  4. Nitrates again (iv), introducing an additional nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target.
- **Option C:** 
  1. Adds the tert-butyl group first (i).
  2. Sulfonates the ring (ii), introducing a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
  3. Nitrates the ring (iii), but the sulfonic acid group would dominate as a meta director, leading to incorrect positioning of the nitro group.
- **Option D:** 
  1. Nitrates the ring first (i), introducing a nitro group.
  2. Reduces the nitro group to an amine (ii), which is unnecessary.
  3. Adds the tert-butyl group (iii).
  4. Nitrates again (iv), introducing an additional nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target.

### Conclusion:
None of the options perfectly match the required sequence of reactions. However, **Option B** comes closest to the correct order, as it adds the tert-butyl group first and nitrates the ring, even though it introduces an additional nitro group later. Despite its flaws, it aligns most closely with the desired sequence.

Answer: B
