Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let me think through this.

So, the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible to improve the electron microscopy because gas can scatter the electrons, right?

But even in this ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles are still present. These were detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike then measures the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember that from my physics classes. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2 and not equal to λ1. But the temperature in the sample compartment is the same as before. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path (λ) is given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is the pressure. Or another version I've heard is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. But I think the key thing is that λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So if pressure decreases, mean free path increases.

But wait, the pressure in the sample compartment is already ultra-low. Mike created that with the pumps. Once he turns on the electron beam, what's happening? Oh, right, the electron beam might be causing some changes. The electrons are moving at high speeds, and when they interact with the gas molecules, they can cause ionization or other effects.

Wait, but the gas particles are in the sample compartment. When the electron beam is on, the electrons could be scattering off the gas molecules. But does that affect the mean free path? Or perhaps more importantly, the electrons themselves are causing the gas to behave differently.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam generates a lot of energy. Maybe it heats the gas molecules. If the temperature increases, the mean free path would increase because of higher velocities. But the question says the temperature remained the same. So that's not it.

Alternatively, could the presence of the electron beam cause the gas molecules to ionize? Ions have different behavior. If gas molecules become ions, their behavior changes. They might have different cross-sections for scattering, or perhaps they're charged and interact more or less with the environment.

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a gas molecule travels without colliding. If the gas molecules are ionized, their mean free path might change because ions could interact more with the walls or with each other, or maybe the presence of charges affects how they move.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam introduces additional factors. For example, the electrons might cause the gas to dissociate or change its composition, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait another angle: the original mean free path λ1 was calculated under the assumption of neutral gas molecules. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas is ionized, so the mean free path changes. Because ions have different properties. Or maybe the electrons are causing a change in the effective pressure because of some kind of charging or other effect.

Hmm, but the temperature hasn't changed. So the major factor would be the change in the collision dynamics. Let me think about the formula again. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the product of the number density (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). So λ = 1/(n σ).

If the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be ionized, then the collision cross-section might change. For example, ions have larger cross-sections because they can cause more significant interactions, or maybe their cross-sections are smaller. Wait, not sure.

Wait, if the gas is ionized, the dominant interaction might change. Neutral molecules collide via van der Waals forces or elastic collisions, but ions could have Coulomb interactions, which are longer-range. So that would change the cross-section.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized particles are moving faster because they are charged and accelerated by the beam. But wait, the electron beam's energy is 1000 kV, which is way higher than typical thermal energies, so the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds. But the gas molecules are probably at thermal speeds, maybe on the order of hundreds of meters per second.

Wait, but the electron beam's presence would cause the gas to be ionized, perhaps, but that's a different thing. Alternatively, the electron current could cause heating of the gas, but the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's not a factor.

Wait, perhaps the electrons are creating a current that causes the gas to be in a different state. Oh, wait! When the electron beam is on, it's a source of radiation that can cause gas molecules to lose electrons (ionization) or gain them (negative ions). But how does that affect the mean free path?

If the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path could be affected because ions have different ways of interacting. For example, charged particles might interact more with the walls of the chamber or with each other, but if the chamber is at the same temperature, maybe the effect is minimal.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to have a different pressure or density if it's being heated or something, but the question says the temperature is the same, so I don't think that's it.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is subjected to a high electric field. The electrons in the beam are moving at high speeds, and their electric fields could influence the motion of the gas molecules. But I'm not sure how that would directly affect the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons in the beam cause the gas to become conducting, which affects the behavior of the gas molecules. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mean free path formula again. The original λ1 was calculated based on the pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. But when the beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure changes because the electrons are causing some other effect.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which could lead to a change in the number density. Because each collision could lead to a molecule being scattered or even ionized and pumped away or something. But if the pressure is already ultra-low, maybe the number density is so low that this effect is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam creates a sort of electric field that affects the gas molecules, causing them to move in a particular direction, thereby changing their effective density in the sample compartment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: mean free path is calculated based on the assumption that the gas is in thermal equilibrium. If the electron beam is causing some non-thermal processes, perhaps the mean free path is altered. But the temperature is the same, so maybe it's not about thermal velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam creates a situation where the gas molecules are more likely to be moving in the same direction as the electrons, or oppositely, which could affect the collision rate.

Wait, but electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules, so perhaps they're not significantly affecting the molecules' velocities. The gas molecules' velocities are on the order of hundreds of m/s, while electrons are at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s). So the electrons are moving way faster. So their collisions with the gas molecules would be at a relative speed much higher than the thermal speed.

Wait, but in terms of momentum transfer, each collision would impart some energy to the gas molecule. But if the electron beam is continuous, perhaps the gas molecules are being accelerated or ionized, leading to a different effective mass or something.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to become ionized, which changes the way they interact. Neutral molecules can have elastic collisions, but ions might have inelastic collisions or different cross-sections. So if the gas is ionized, the mean free path could change.

If the gas is ionized, the mean free path might increase or decrease. Let's think: suppose ions have a larger collision cross-section. Then σ increases, so λ = 1/(n σ) would decrease, meaning λ2 < λ1. Or if ions have a smaller σ, λ would increase.

Wait, actually, for ions, the cross-section for Coulomb interactions is different. Neutral molecules interact via van der Waals forces, which are weak and short-range. Ions, on the other hand, have long-range Coulomb forces, which can cause more frequent or stronger interactions. So the collision cross-section σ for ions would be larger than that for neutral molecules.

If σ increases, and assuming n (number density) remains roughly the same, then λ = 1/(n σ) would decrease. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1, which was the original mean free path.

But wait, does the number density n change? When the gas is ionized, does that increase or decrease the number density of charged species? Well, if the gas is being ionized, the number of neutral molecules decreases, and the number of ions increases. But assuming the ionization is a small fraction, the overall number density might not change much, especially in a high vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas has a different behavior, but the main point is that σ is larger. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So, in the scenario, when Mike turns on the electron beam, the mean free path becomes λ2, which is less than λ1. So the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

Looking back at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1 → No, that would mean it's longer, which isn't the case.

B) λ2 = λ1 → Discrepancy in observation, but the question says λ2 is different.

C) λ2 < λ1 → This fits our reasoning.

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1 → No, that's the opposite.

So the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV, Mike creates an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment to minimize gas molecule scattering. The mean free path of the gas molecules, λ1, is determined under these conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observes a new mean free path, λ2, which differs from λ1 despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path (λ) is influenced by factors such as pressure, temperature, and the collision cross-section (σ) of the gas molecules. The formula for λ is inversely proportional to the product of the number density (n) and σ: 

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma}.
\]

When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules may become ionized due to interactions with the high-energy electrons. Ionized gas molecules exhibit different collision dynamics compared to neutral molecules. Specifically, ions have larger collision cross-sections (σ) due to long-range Coulomb interactions, unlike neutral molecules, which interact via short-range van der Waals forces. 

If σ increases while the number density (n) remains approximately constant, the mean free path decreases. Therefore, λ2, the mean free path under the influence of the electron beam, is smaller than λ1. This explains why Mike observes λ2 < λ1.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1**: Incorrect, as this would imply the mean free path increases, which contradicts the observed decrease due to ionization.
- **B) λ2 = λ1**: Incorrect, as the problem explicitly states that λ2 ≠ λ1.
- **C) λ2 < λ1**: Correct, as ionization increases the collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path.
- **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1**: Incorrect, as this suggests λ2 is larger than λ1, which is inconsistent with the scenario.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1 due to the increased collision cross-section of ionized gas molecules.
