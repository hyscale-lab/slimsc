Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how their number per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d). Like, the formula is p = 1/d, but wait, actually, I think it's p = 1/(d) where d is in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, 0.5 would be 2 parsecs, etc.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So I guess it's asking how many stars are there in a certain range of parallax values. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their density in space must be uniform.

Wait, so if they are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant in space. Number density is number per unit volume. So, the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region.

But how does the parallax relate to the volume? Let me think. Parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So for a given parallax range, say from p to p + dp, what is the corresponding distance range?

If p increases, d decreases. So, p ranges from 0 to some maximum. Let's say we're looking at a thin shell of stars at a certain distance. The number of stars in a thin shell would be n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density, 4π d² is the surface area, and dd is the thickness. But wait, since p is 1/d, we can express things in terms of p.

Wait, let me approach this step by step. The number of stars in a certain distance range is given by the number density multiplied by the volume. For a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is approximately 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd.

But since parallax p = 1/d, let's express everything in terms of p. So d = 1/p, and dd is the change in d. Hmm, so let me substitute. Let's express dd in terms of dp.

If d = 1/p, then dd = -1/p² dp. Oh, but since we're dealing with positive ranges, the negative just indicates direction, so I can ignore the sign for now. So, dd = (1/p²) dp.

So substituting into the number of stars:

N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the shell volume is 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/p, and dd = (1/p²) dp:

N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp

Wait, that gives N = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

But that can't be right because the number of stars per unit parallax should depend on how the volume element changes with p. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the substitution.

Wait another approach: Let's think about the relationship between distance and parallax. The parallax p (in arcseconds) is equal to 1/d (in parsecs). So d = 1/p.

If we have a range of parallax from p to p + dp, what is the corresponding range of distance? Since d = 1/p, when p increases, d decreases. So the distance range from d to d - dd, where dd is the change in d. So for a small dp, the change in distance dd is approximately - (1/p²) dp, but again, focusing on magnitude: dd = (1/p²) dp.

The volume of the shell between d and d + dd (but wait, since d is decreasing as p increases, maybe I should think in terms of p increasing). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the number of stars in a thin shell in terms of p. So the shell's volume is 4π d² dd, which is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that would be 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Hmm, so the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so if we're looking at a small dp (like a bin of width dp), the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The number per unit parallax (like per arcsecond) would be N/(dp) = 4π n / p^4. So as p increases, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as 1/p^4.

But that's not matching any of the options given. Wait, the options are A) 1/p^4, B) 1/p^2, C) 1/p, D) 1/p^3.

Wait, but according to this, the number per unit parallax decreases as 1/p^4, so option A would be correct. But I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe it would be 1/p^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's go through the steps again.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density. We can express dd in terms of dp, since p = 1/d. So, d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp

= n * 4π (1/p^4) dp

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit range of parallax ~ 1/p^4. Which would be option A.

But wait, the question says 'number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.' So for each unit increase in plx, how does the count change? So if plx is p, then the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, another approach. Let's think about the volume. The volume at a certain distance d is a shell of radius d and thickness dd. The volume is 4π d² dd. The number of stars in that volume is n * 4π d² dd.

But since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So the volume in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Which is 4π/p^4 dp.

So number per unit p would be 4π n / p^4. So as p increases, the number per unit p decreases like 1/p^4. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have mixed up the concepts. Another way: think about the number of stars in a range of distances. For a given distance d, the number per unit distance (in terms of d) is proportional to d², since the volume element increases with d² for a shell. But if we are considering parallax, which is inversely proportional to d, the relationship changes.

So, for parallax p, the number of stars per unit p would be n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (d's derivative). Since p = 1/d → dp/dd = -1/d² → dd = -d² dp → d=1/p → dd= (1/p²) dp.

So substituting into N = n 4π d² dd:

= n 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp

= n 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So N per unit p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as 1/p^4, which is option A.

But wait, I'm a bit concerned because another approach I've heard before is that the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to 1/p^2, but that's probably incorrect. Because the number density n is uniform, so it's a constant. So the number of stars in a shell is n * 4π d² dd. So when you express this in terms of p, you get n *4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit p is 4π n /p^4. So the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to p^4.

So the answer should be option A, ~1/p^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). For a thin spherical shell of stars at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the number density \( n \) of stars multiplied by the volume, giving \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Expressing \( d \) and \( dd \) in terms of \( p \), we have \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -1/p^2 dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right),
\]

ignoring the negative sign for magnitude. Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This shows that as \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **A) \( \sim 1/p^4 \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) \( \sim 1/p^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) \( \sim 1/p \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
- **D) \( \sim 1/p^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( 1/p^4 \), not \( 1/p^3 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
