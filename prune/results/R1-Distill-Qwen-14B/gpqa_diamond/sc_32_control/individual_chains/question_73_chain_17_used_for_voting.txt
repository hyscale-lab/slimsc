Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use special relativity, right? Let me think.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities. Oh right, you can't just do v1 - v2 because that doesn't take into account the relativistic effects. I think the formula for the relative speed is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down.

So astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, astronaut B has 3m and 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or wait, are we considering the relative speed of one with respect to the other? I think the question is asking for the relative speed between them. So, which astronaut's frame are we considering? Oh, probably the relative speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, no, the problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." Oh, maybe the relative speed is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So let's pick one frame, say the rest frame of astronaut A. In that frame, what's the speed of astronaut B?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just v1 - v2 because of relativity. So let me recall the formula for relative velocity in relativity. The relative speed u of object B as seen from object A's frame is given by (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). 

Yes, that's right. So plugging in the numbers, v_A is 0.6c and v_B is 0.5c. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that both are moving in the positive x-direction, but I'm getting confused because in the scenario, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c. So from the perspective of someone at rest, A is moving faster than B. But to find the relative speed, I need the speed of B as seen from A's frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "relative speed" — which way? Because relative speed is a vector, so direction matters. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be positive. Hmm.

So using the formula: u = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, that's if you're calculating the speed of B as seen from A's frame. Or is it the other way around? Let me make sure. Oh yeah, I think the formula is u = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of B in A’s frame. Because in A's frame, A is stationary, and B is moving at u.

So substituting the values: v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c.

So u = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (0.5 - 0.6) c = (-0.1) c. Hmm, negative value? That would imply that in A's frame, B is moving at -0.1c, which would be in the opposite direction. But wait, both are moving in the same direction as seen from the rest frame. So from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c, B would be moving slower. But since A is moving faster, in A's frame B would appear to be moving backwards? Or wait, perhaps I got the formula reversed.

Wait, wait another moment. Let me think again. The formula for relative velocity when calculating u as the velocity of B from A's frame. So if in the rest frame S, A is moving at v_A and B at v_B, then the velocity u of B in A's frame (S') is given by u = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, but if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower. Let's compute:

u = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/(c²)].

Compute denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Numerator: -0.1c.

So u = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c.

Wait, but speed is a scalar. So the magnitude would be 0.1428c. But wait, the question is about the relative speed, which is a scalar. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded.

Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. The other options have 1.1c (which is impossible, since nothing can go faster than c) and 0.1c.

So the relative speed would be approximately 0.14c.

Now, what about the total energy of the system?

The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So compute the energy for each astronaut.

For astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait. Wait, more accurately, E = gamma * m_total c². So for A, m is 2m, so E_A = gamma_A * (2m) c^2.

Gamma for A: 1.25.

E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = Gamma_B * 3m c² = approximately 1.1547 * 3 = 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me calculate that precisely. 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.4641 m c².

So the total energy E_total = E_A + E_B = 2.5 m c² + 3.4641 m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

So the total energy would be approximately 5.96 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation.

Wait, so A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c in the same direction. The relative speed of B as seen from A's frame is u = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, v_B is 0.5c, v_A is 0.6c, so (0.5c - 0.6c) is -0.1c. Divided by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) = (1 - 0.3) = 0.7.

So u = -0.1c / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction; the speed is 0.1428c in the opposite direction of A's motion. But the question asks for the relative speed, which is a scalar, so 0.14c.

So yes, the relative speed is about 0.14c. So the options C and D have that. But the energy in C is higher, 5.96, while D is 5.

Wait, in my calculation, E_total was approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

E_A: gamma is 1.25, m=2m, so E=1.25 * 2 * mc²=2.5 mc².

E_B: gamma=1/sqrt(1 - 0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)=approx 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 = 3.4641 mc².

Sum: 2.5 +3.4641=5.9641, which is approximately 5.96 mc². So yes, option C is correct.

Thus, the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one object as seen from another's frame is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
u = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the relative speed is a scalar, so the magnitude is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A:
- Mass: \(2m\), Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_A = \gamma_A (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For Astronaut B:
- Mass: \(3m\), Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_B = \gamma_B (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\), \(E = mc^2\) (incorrect)
- **Option B**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96m c^2\) (incorrect)
- **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\) (correct)
- **Option D**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\) (incorrect)

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
