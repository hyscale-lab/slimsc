Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate, and we're supposed to find the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, stability constants are given, so I think I need to use those somehow.

Alright, the problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually refer to the formation of complexes, right? So each β represents the formation constant for a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions.

So, the complexes would be Co(SCN)n^2- where n is 1,2,3,4. The stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, β1 is for Co(SCN)²+, right? Because each SCN- is -1, so n=1 would be Co(SCN)²+ with a charge of +2 (since Co²+ plus one SCN⁻ gives overall +2 charge? Wait no, wait. Co²+ plus one SCN⁻ would be Co(SCN)²+? Wait, no. Co²+ plus SCN⁻: the complex would be Co(SCN)²+? Let me think. Co²+ has a +2 charge, SCN⁻ is -1. So Co(SCN) would be Co²+ (which is +2) plus one SCN⁻ (-1), so overall charge is +1. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Maybe it's Co(SCN)_n^(2-?), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are neutral? Maybe I should just proceed with the given β values.

So the problem wants the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions attached, so that's the n=2 complex. The blue color probably corresponds to the Co(SCN)₂ complex.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of the species depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. So, I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of Co(SCN)₂²+ (if that's the correct formula) among all the possible cobalt species.

Let me write down all the possible complexes:

n=0: Co²+ → this is the free ion.

n=1: Co(SCN)²+ (assuming charge is +2 - wait, that may not be right. Let me think again. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So for Co²+ combining with n SCN⁻, the charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So for n=1, the charge is +1 → Co(SCN)²+? No, wait, the formula would be Co(SCN)²+ if the charge is +2 - n=1 would give +1, so the formula would be [Co(SCN)]⁺? That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formation of the complexes step-wise.

But maybe I don't need to worry about the charges for this calculation. The key is the stability constants, which determine the relative concentrations of each complex.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth complex.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co²+ ion. Then sum all the fractions to get the relative amounts, and see what percentage the n=2 complex contributes.

The general approach is to consider the distribution of Co among all possible complexes, considering the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN⁻.

The formula for the fraction of a particular complex (say, with n SCN⁻) is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN⁻]^n) / (1 + Σ (β_k [SCN⁻]^k) for k=0 to 4 )

Wait, actually, the free ion is when n=0. So for each n, the term would be βn*[SCN]^n, but wait, for n=0, the term is 1, since it's just Co²+.

Wait, no. Let me think about the formation of the complexes. The first complex is CoSCN²+ (n=1), which forms from Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²+; the β1 is the formation constant for this.

Similarly, the second complex (n=2) is formed from CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂^0? Or perhaps another charge. Hmm, perhaps the formula is getting me stuck. Maybe it's better to proceed with the calculation, regardless of the exact charges.

The key point is that each subsequent βn is the formation constant for adding another SCN⁻ to the previous complex. So, the total is the sum of all possible complexes, each weighted by their respective terms.

So, the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum over m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^m )

Wait, no. Because each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN⁻ ions. So for each n, the term is (βn * [SCN]^n ), and the denominator is the sum for all m from 0 to 4 of these terms.

Wait, but for m=0, it's Co²+ with no SCN attached. The term would be β0 [SCN]^0, where β0 is 1, because it's just the free ion. So yes, the denominator is Σ (βm [SCN]^m) from m=0 to 4.

So, to compute the fraction for the n=2 complex, it's (β2 [SCN]^2) / (Σ (βm [SCN]^m) )

So, let's compute each term:

[SCN] is given as 0.1 M.

Compute each βm * [SCN]^m for m=0 to 4.

m=0:
β0 = 1 (since it's the free ion)
[SCN]^0 = 1
Term = 1 * 1 = 1

m=1:
β1=9
[SCN]^1=0.1 → 0.1
Term =9 * 0.1 = 0.9

m=2:
β2=40
[SCN]^2= (0.1)^2=0.01 → 0.01
Term=40 * 0.01=0.4

m=3:
β3=63
[SCN]^3=0.1^3=0.001 → 0.001
Term=63 * 0.001=0.063

m=4:
β4=16
[SCN]^4=0.1^4=0.0001 → 0.0001
Term=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Now, sum all these terms:

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

Let me compute that step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

The term for n=2 is 0.4.

So the fraction f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Hmm, 2.3646 ≈ 2.3646.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 (since 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.4)

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

2.3646 * 0.169 = ?

2 * 0.169 is 0.338.

0.3646 * 0.169 → 0.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.3646 * 0.17 is about 0.061982. Hmm, wait, but perhaps I should just do the division properly.

Alternatively, 0.4 / 2.3646:

Let me compute 0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 × 0.169 = approximately 0.4?

Wait, let me compute 2.3646 × 0.169:

2.3646 × 0.1 = 0.23646

2.3646 × 0.06 = 0.141876

2.3646 × 0.009 = 0.0212814

Adding these together: 0.23646 +0.141876=0.378336; +0.0212814=0.3996174.

Which is about 0.4, but wait, 0.3996 is about 0.4, so yes, 0.169 gives 0.3996, which is close to 0.4. So 0.4 ÷ 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is the n=2 complex. So according to this calculation, the fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the problem statement. Are they asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species, or considering the free ion as well?

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. Wait, that's the total concentration of all species. So the sum of all fractions f_n should be 1, right? Because each fraction represents the proportion of each complex relative to the free Co²+.

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, I considered the sum as 2.3646, but the fractions are f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / sum, which is correct because each term in the denominator includes all possible complexes.

So the fraction of the n=2 complex is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, but I think I might have made a mistake here, because I have a feeling the answer might be different. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, another approach: some sources say that the fraction of each species is given by (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did. So the denominator is sum of (βm [SCN]^m) for m=0 to 4.

In this case, I computed each term correctly:

m=0 → 1
m=1 → 0.9
m=2 → 0.4
m=3 → 0.063
m=4 → 0.0016

Sum is 2.3646.

So f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9% → option D.

But looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is higher than this. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the βn values. Let me look again.

Wait, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, so β2 is 40. So for m=2, the term is 40*(0.1)^2=40 * 0.01=0.4, which is correct.

Hmm. Let me recompute the denominator sum to make sure.

m=0: 1 → 1
m=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 → 0.9
m=2:40 *0.01=0.4 →0.4
m=3:63 * 0.001=0.063 →0.063
m=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016 →0.0016

Sum is 1 + 0.9 =1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

So f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, 0.169 is 16.9%, which is option D. But wait, the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think sometimes in such problems, the dithiocyanato complex is the most stable, but in this case, the β3 is the highest at 63. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the denominator. Let me recompute:

Wait, when m=3, β3=63, [SCN]^3=0.1^3=0.001. 63 * 0.001=0.063.

m=4:16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

So denominator is 1 + 0.9=1.9; 1.9 +0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is correct.

So f_2 is 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 16.9%. So option D.

But wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. Does this affect the calculation? Oh wait, because the fractions are normalized relative to the free ion, the total concentration is distributed among all species, so the fractions should sum to 1. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the stability constant for the dithiocyanato complex is β2=40, and the trithiocyanato is β3=63, which is higher than β2, so perhaps the trithiocyanato is more stable. But the question is about the dithiocyanato's percentage.

But according to my calculation, the dithiocyanato (n=2) is about 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is 38.1%, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that when the [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is quite high. So perhaps the higher-order complexes are more favored. Let me re-examine the β values. The β3 is the largest, so the trithiocyanato complex would be the most abundant.

Wait, let me compute each fraction:

f_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423 → 42.3% → option A.

f_1 = 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.381 → 38.1% → option C.

f_2=0.4/2.3646≈16.9% → option D.

f_3=0.063/2.3646≈ 0.0266 → 2.66%

f_4=0.0016/2.3646≈ 0.000676 → 0.0676%

So the largest fraction is f_0 (42.3%) and then f_1 (38.1%), then f_2 (16.9%).

So the percentage for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (n=2) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16, and the given concentrations: total cobalt concentration \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
\]

where \( \beta_0 = 1 \) for the free ion (n=0). The terms for each \( m \) are computed as follows:

- \( m=0 \): \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( m=1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( m=2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( m=3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( m=4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The sum of these terms is:

\[
\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the n=2 complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.
