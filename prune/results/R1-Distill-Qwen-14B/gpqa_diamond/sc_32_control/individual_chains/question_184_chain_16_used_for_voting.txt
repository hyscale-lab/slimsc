Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I think about the substituents on the benzene ring. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent. The target structure: the substituents are tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Or wait, maybe I'm mixing the numbering. Let me think: when numbering, the substituents with lower numbers come first. So the lowest possible set of numbers for the substituents would be positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Or does it depend on the priority of the substituents?

Wait, the substituents' priority for numbering depends on their functional group. The order of seniority is usually based on the functional group. Let me recall: the seniority order is given by the substituent with the higher priority. The priority is determined by the first atom in the substituent. So, the nitro group (NO2) has higher priority than ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3), which in turn has higher priority than tert-butyl (a branched alkyl group). So when numbering, the nitro group would get the lowest possible number. 

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Hmm, but according to numbering rules, the nitro (highest priority) should get the lowest number. So in this case, the nitro is at position 3, but maybe that's not the lowest. Wait, perhaps the positions are numbered such that the substituents are arranged to give the lowest set of numbers. Let me think: if nitro is at position 1, ethoxy at 2, and tert-butyl at 3, that would give a lower set of numbers. But the target molecule has nitro at 3, which is higher than 1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target.

Wait no, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the numbers are 1, 2, and 3. Let me think: perhaps the nitro group is at position 1, ethoxy at 2, and tert-butyl at 3. But the target molecule is 2-tert-butyl... so I'm getting a bit stuck on the numbering. Maybe I should just think about the substituents without worrying about the numbering for now. Let me focus on the synthesis steps.

So, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The question is about the reaction sequence starting from benzene. So, I need to introduce these three substituents in some order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Benzene is the starting material. Let me recall the directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Alky groups (like tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors. Ethoxy is an activating group, which is an ortho/para director. Wait, no, ethoxy is an ether, which is an activating group because of the lone pairs on oxygen. So, it's ortho/para directing.

Wait, but when substituents are present, their directing effects can influence where new groups will attach. The order in which groups are introduced matters because each substituent directs incoming groups to specific positions.

So, the plan is to introduce the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that they are adjacent to each other. So, perhaps a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to figure out which substituent is introduced first, then second, then third, considering the directing.

Let me think: when adding substituents to benzene, the first substituent doesn't have any directing, but the second will be added based on the first's directing. The third will depend on the positions relative to both first and second.

In this case, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me consider the nitro group. It's a strong meta director. So, if I introduce nitro first, then the next substituent would go into the meta position relative to nitro. But wait, nitro is a meta director, but it's a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

Alternatively, introducing an activating group first might make the ring more reactive, but that depends on the order.

Wait, let me think about the steps.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) which would introduce the t-butyl group. Then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), then a bunch of steps. Wait, but I'm looking at the options and trying to find which sequence correctly adds the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the order. Let's think about the possible order of substituents.

If I were to first introduce the tert-butyl group, which is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group), which is ortho/para directing. Then, perhaps introduce the nitro group next. Since nitro is a meta director, but it's a deactivating group.

Wait, but after adding the tert-butyl group, the ring is activated. So the next substitution (nitration) would occur ortho or para to t-butyl. But wait, nitro is a meta director, but if the ring is activated, perhaps the nitration's position is influenced by the existing substituent.

Wait, perhaps the nitration would occur at the ortho or para position relative to the t-butyl group. But since nitro is a meta director, does that affect where it goes? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced in a position that is meta to both the ethoxy and the t-butyl groups. But wait, how would that happen?

Let me think about possible reaction sequences.

Another approach: Let's look at the target molecule. The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last because it's a deactivating group. Because once nitro is present, it makes the ring less reactive, which might complicate adding other groups, but wait, in this case, all substituents are already present. Hmm.

Wait, the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So, perhaps the order is: introduce ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Or another order.

Wait, when you have multiple substituents, the order of addition affects their positions. Let me think step by step.

Option D seems to have the first step as nitration. Let me check the options.

Option D's steps: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride. Hmm, wait. So benzene first nitrated, introducing nitro group. Then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl. But wait, nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So when adding the t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts, which requires the ring to be activated. But nitro is deactivating, so after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts (which requires an activated ring) would not proceed. So if option D starts with nitration, then the next step (AlCl3 and t-butyl chloride) wouldn't work. So that can't be right.

So option D is probably incorrect because you can't do Friedel-Crafts after nitration.

Looking at option A: the first step is t-butyl chloride with AlCl3. So that introduces the t-butyl group. Then, nitration (step ii). Then, step iii is SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), not sure where that comes in. Wait, but the target has ethoxy, nitro, and t-butyl. So, when would the ethoxy group be introduced?

Looking at the steps in option A, after t-butyl, nitration, and sulfonation, there's a step iv) NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization, then H3O+/H2O/heat (maybe hydrolysis?), then NaOH and EtBr, which is a Williamson-type ether synthesis? Or perhaps a SN2 reaction? Then Fe/HCl, another nitration, etc. Hmm, this seems like a lot.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on which substituents are where and the order of their introduction.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). Let me consider the order in which these groups are added.

One possible approach is to introduce the nitro group last, because once it's in place, it's a meta director and deactivating, which might complicate adding other substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the activating groups first to facilitate the addition of other groups.

Wait, but nitration is a strong deactivating step, so maybe it's better to add it after activating groups.

Let me think about the steps needed for each substituent.

Adding ethoxy group: can be introduced via ether formation. For example, using ethyl bromide with a strong base like NaOH (Williamson synthesis) but benzene isn't typically directly nucleophilic. Alternatively, perhaps introducing an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but alkylation requires a catalyst, and the position depends on the directing groups present.

Wait, no, ethoxy group is an ether, so perhaps via sulfonation followed by displacement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the ethyl chloride and AlCl3 for Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for adding an alkyl group, not an ether. Alternatively, perhaps introducing an ethyl group via electrophilic substitution and then converting it to an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nitration, then reduction, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a side chain alkylation after adding certain substituents.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to introduce the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl, and then the nitro.

But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so after it's added, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would be added ortho or para to it. Then, adding nitro group, which is a deactivating group and meta director, but the ring would have two activating groups, which might complicate the addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is t-butyl first, ethoxy second, nitro third. Let me think.

t-butyl is introduced via Friedel-Crafts: first step. Then, ethoxy group: perhaps via another Friedel-Crafts? But wait, ethoxy is an ether; Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for adding ethers. So maybe that's not the way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps introducing ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution. For example, introduce a sulfonic acid group (which is a good leaving group), then substitute it with an ethoxy group. Alternatively, perhaps via a benzyne intermediate, but that might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction. But that seems not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after nitration. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via the nitration and subsequent diazotization and substitution, but that's for amines.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each substituent's introduction.

t-butyl group: via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (needs activated ring, so must be introduced before deactivating groups like nitro).

Nitro group: via nitration, which is a deactivating step.

Ethoxy group: perhaps via an ether-forming reaction, like using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs activating groups, or perhaps a strong activating group adjacent.

Wait, but for nucleophilic substitution, the ring is usually activated by strong electron-donating groups. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution where a leaving group is present, such as a nitro group being replaced, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonic ester. For example, introducing a sulfonic acid group first (using SO3/H2SO4 as in sulfonation), then substituting the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution. But that would require the sulfonic group to be a good leaving group, which it is under certain conditions.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reaction or similar, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, but that's more for alcohols.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me think about each option's steps.

Looking at option C: the steps are i) t-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts, adds t-butyl), ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation, adds a sulfonic acid group?), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), vi) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?), etc.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each step in the options.

Option A:

i) t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since t-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director, the nitration would occur at ortho or para to t-butyl. But the target has nitro at position 3, which would be meta to t-butyl. So that might not fit. Wait, let me think: If t-butyl is at position 1, then nitration at position 3 would be meta to t-butyl. But t-butyl is an ortho/para director, so nitration should occur at ortho or para.

Wait, that might not be possible. So perhaps the nitration in option A would add to ortho or para of t-butyl.

If t-butyl is at position 1, nitration would occur at 2 or 4. But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is meta to t-butyl. So perhaps option A's steps would not get nitro at the correct position.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the t-butyl. Let me see another option.

Option D starts with nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). So benzene becomes nitrobenzene. Then, step iii is Friedel-Crafts with t-butyl chloride. But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So option D is incorrect.

Option B: steps are i) t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So nitro would be added ortho or para to t-butyl. So if t-butyl is at 1, nitro at 2 or 4. Then step iii is Fe/HCl. Hmm, Fe/HCl is a reducing agent, perhaps used in the Bechamp reaction or for reducing nitro groups? Wait, Fe/HCl in the presence of a nitro group would reduce it to an amine. But in this case, if we have a nitro group, adding Fe/HCl would convert it to an amino group.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group, so that might not make sense. Unless there's a subsequent re-nitration.

Looking further, option B's steps: after nitration comes Fe/HCl (maybe reduction of nitro to amine), then another nitration. That seems strange because why go through the trouble of reducing and then nitrating again. I'm not sure about that.

Option C: steps i) t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). Then step iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, since sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, the nitration would occur meta to the sulfonic acid group. So if sulfonic acid is at position 1, nitration would be at 3.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 3. So, after sulfonation, nitration would place nitro at position 3 relative to sulfonic acid. Then step iv) Fe/HCl, which would reduce the nitro group to amine. So, that's not helpful for retaining nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is used as a leaving group to introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, after sulfonation, you have a -SO3H group. Then, perhaps you can perform a nucleophilic substitution. For example, treat with NaOH and EtBr to substitute the -SO3H group with OEt via a Williamson-type reaction. But wait, sulfonic acid groups are good leaving groups under certain conditions, like in aq. H2SO4 and heat.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Introduce t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Sulfonate to add -SO3H group.

3. Nitration in a position directed by the t-butyl and sulfonic acid.

Wait, but the sulfonic acid is a meta director, while t-butyl is ortho/para.

So, when both are present, the next substitution would be influenced by both. The strongest director would likely dominate, but it's tricky. If one is activating and the other is deactivating, the activating group (t-butyl) might have more influence.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is introduced to facilitate substitution with ethoxy.

Wait, let me think: after sulfonating, you have a benzene ring with t-butyl and sulfonic acid groups. Then, you replace the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy. So, the sulfonic acid group is a good leaving group, so under certain conditions, like heating with ethanol and acid, perhaps the -SO3H is replaced by OEt.

Wait, but the substitution would require a good leaving group, which SO3H is, but typically, it's replaced under basic conditions, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy via another Friedel-Crafts, but wait, ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide suitable for Friedel-Crafts. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds alkyl groups, not ethers. So that wouldn't work. So perhaps not.

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where a leaving group is present.

Wait, but benzene itself isn't nucleophilic. To enable substitution, perhaps a good leaving group is introduced first, like a nitro group, and then replaced.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the nitro group via a substitution. For example, if a nitro group is present, perhaps under certain conditions, it can be replaced with an ethoxy group.

But that's not straightforward. Nitro groups are not typically good leaving groups under normal conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which can then be used in a diazotization and substitution reaction.

Wait, so if the nitro group is reduced to amino, then treated with a diazotizing agent (like NaNO2/HCl), then heated with ethanol, perhaps the amino group can be replaced by an ethoxy group.

Wait, that could be a possibility.

Let me try to outline a possible synthesis path.

1. Start with benzene.

2. Introduce t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, t-butyl is at position 1.

3. Next, introduce a nitro group. Since t-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director, nitration would occur at ortho or para positions. Let's say nitro is at position 3 (meta to t-butyl? No, wait, t-butyl is an ortho/para director. So nitro would be at 2 or 4. But the target has nitro at 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is introduced at a position meta to the ethoxy group. So perhaps I should first introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, but how? Let's think again.

Another possible synthesis path:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

But then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation won't work because nitro is deactivating. So that's a problem.

Alternative approach: Maybe introduce ethoxy first.

But how? Because benzene doesn't directly react for Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add an ether.

Wait, perhaps first introduce a substituent that can be converted into ethoxy.

For example:

1. Benzene → introduce a nitro group (HNO3/H2SO4).

2. Then, reduce nitro to amine (Fe/HCl).

3. Then, diazotize (NaNO2/HCl) to form diazonium salt.

4. Then, perform a coupling reaction to introduce an ethoxy group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use a substitution reaction after nitration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonate group.

So:

1. Benzene → first introduce t-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Then, sulfonate to introduce a -SO3H group (SO3/H2SO4).

3. Now, the ring has t-butyl and sulfonate groups.

4. Next, nitrate. Since sulfonate is a meta director and deactivating, and t-butyl is activating and ortho/para, the nitration would be influenced by both. But t-butyl is activating, so it would likely direct more.

But perhaps the nitration occurs at position 3 relative to t-butyl, which is meta. But t-butyl is an ortho/para director, so nitration should be at ortho or para. So this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added at a position that's ortho to the t-butyl and meta to the sulfonate. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe:

1. Introduce t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce ethoxy via another method, perhaps using a side chain.

Wait, this is getting me stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C: The steps are:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis or something.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a substitution.

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me try to map it.

After step i, we have t-butylbenzene.

Step ii: sulfonate to get t-butylbenzene sulfonic acid.

Step iii: nitrate. Since the ring has t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta), the nitration might occur at a position directed by the activating group. So, nitro could be at ortho or para to t-butyl.

Then, step iv: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine. Now, we have a benzene ring with t-butyl, sulfonic acid, and amine groups.

Step v: diazotization with NaNO2/HCl. The amine group is converted to a diazonium salt.

Step vi: HNO3/H2SO4 → perhaps a second nitration? But I'm not sure where that would go.

This seems to complicate matters, and I'm not sure if this leads to the correct substituent arrangement.

Let me think about option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Nitro added ortho or para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Now, with the amine group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So nitration would occur ortho or para to the amine. But the target has nitro in a specific position.

Wait, perhaps after reduction, the amine is present, and then nitrating again would add nitro in a new position.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the positions are 1, 2, 3. So, substituents are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first, then the t-butyl, and then the nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy first? Because benzene doesn't directly react to add ether groups.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution of a nitro group. For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize and substitute with ethoxy group. Wait, under certain conditions, diazonium salts can be substituted with alcohols or ethers. For example, diazonium salt treated with ethanol and H2SO4 can give substitution with ethoxy group.

So, if we have aniline, convert to diazonium chloride, then treat with ethanol and dilute H2SO4 to substitute with ethoxy.

So, step 1: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

Step 3: diazotize → diazonium salt.

Step 4: substitute with ethoxy → benzene with ethoxy group.

But then, the ring has ethoxy (activating), but to add tert-butyl, which requires an activated ring, because Friedel-Crafts alkylation needs an activating group.

So, after ethoxy is added, we can perform Friedel-Crafts to add t-butyl. Then, nitration would add nitro group.

Wait, but the target has nitro as a substituent, so when would that be added?

Wait, in this approach, after adding ethoxy, add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

Then, nitrate.

But nitration would be directed by the ethoxy (ortho/para) and t-butyl (ortho/para). So, the nitro group would end up somewhere based on both.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added to a position that is meta to an existing group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to think of the correct order of substituents:

If I have to have nitro, ethoxy, and t-butyl in positions 1,2,3, perhaps the nitro is added last, because it's a deactivating group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro group via nitration, which would be ortho or para to t-butyl.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so substituting might be difficult unless using a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is present.

Wait, perhaps after adding t-butyl and nitro, the sulfonic acid group is introduced, then replaced with ethoxy.

But that's getting a bit complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy via some method.

2. Then, introduce t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Then, nitrate to add nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy?

Wait, perhaps ethoxy can be introduced via a nitration followed by reduction and substitution.

Wait, let's think: If we first nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then reduce nitro to amine to get aniline. Then, convert to diazonium salt and substitute with ethoxy group.

So, steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium salt.

iv) H3O+ (ethanol) → substitution with ethoxy → benzene with ethoxy group.

Then, perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl group.

Then, nitrate → add nitro group.

But wait, after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, the ring is activated, so nitration would occur ortho or para to ethoxy and t-butyl.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this would lead to the desired substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce ethoxy via some method.

3. Nitrate to introduce nitro group.

But again, the exact steps are unclear.

Wait, looking at option C again. Let me see what the steps would do.

Option C's steps:

i) t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate → adds -SO3H.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps SN2 substitution.

So, let's map it:

After step i: t-butylbenzene.

Step ii: sulfonate → t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.

Step iii: nitrate. Now, the ring has t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta). The nitration would be directed by t-butyl, so nitro would be at ortho or para relative to t-butyl. Let's say it's at position 3 (but t-butyl is at 1, so ortho would be 2, para 4).

So, nitro at 3 is meta to t-butyl? No, because t-butyl is at 1, nitro at 3 is meta.

Wait, but t-butyl is ortho/para director. So, nitration should occur at ortho (2) or para (4) relative to t-butyl. So, nitro at 3 wouldn't be possible with this sequence.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one. Let me see.

Option A's steps:

i) t-butyl chloride, AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. So, nitro at ortho or para to t-butyl.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

v) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a carbonyl? Not sure.)

vi) NaOH, EtBr → perhaps SN2, like Williamson synthesis.

vii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

viii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, after step i, t-butyl is present.

Step ii: nitro at ortho or para.

Then, step iii: sulfonate, which adds a -SO3H group. Where would that go? It depends on the directing groups.

If after step ii, the ring has t-butyl and nitro, which are both meta directors? Wait, no: t-butyl is activating (ortho/para), nitro is deactivating (meta). So when sulfonating, the new group would be directed by the existing substituents.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the correct option is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Sulfonate to introduce a good leaving group.

3. Nitrate in a position directed by t-butyl.

4. Reduce nitro to amine.

5. Diazotize and substitute with ethoxy.

6. Then, nitrate again in a new position.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitration → add nitro.

2. Friedel-Crafts → add t-butyl (but nitro is deactivating, so this won't work).

So, D is incorrect.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, t-butyl, nitro. Let's think about the order.

If I add the nitro last, the ring would have two activating groups (t-butyl and ethoxy) which would make it easier for the nitration to occur. Nitro being a meta director would then be added in the correct position.

Wait, but to add nitro last, I need to have the other groups in place.

So, the steps could be:

1. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy via some method.

3. Nitrate to add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy?

Wait, perhaps ethoxy can be introduced via a substitution reaction. For example:

After adding t-butyl, introduce a nitro group which is then reduced to amine, then substituted with ethoxy.

So:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl.

2. Nitration → nitro at ortho or para.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize → diazonium salt.

5. Substitute with ethoxy → now, ethoxy is in the position where nitro was.

Then, perform another nitration if needed.

But the target already has nitro as a substituent, so this approach might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy and t-butyl.

But then, the ring is activated by both ethoxy and t-butyl, making nitration relatively easy.

So, adding nitro last would be possible.

So, synthesis steps:

1. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy via substitution (perhaps via nitro → amine → diazonium → ethoxy).

3. Nitrate to add nitro.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C's steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) reduce nitro to amine.

v) diazotize.

vi) nitrate again.

vii) hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH and EtBr.

Hmm, perhaps after the first nitration, we have nitro at position 3 relative to t-butyl. Then, when reduced to amine, it becomes an amino group. Then, diazotization and substitution.

Wait, but the target has nitro, so perhaps the nitro is not reduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option C don't lead to the target.

At this point, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another thought: the target has three substituents. Let me think about their positions in the ring.

If the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro), that's a meta arrangement between ethoxy and nitro, and adjacent between t-butyl and nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Add nitro (nitration, ortho to t-butyl).

3. Add ethoxy (substitution).

But how?

After nitration, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. To add ethoxy, perhaps we can use a substitution where nitro is converted to a good leaving group. But nitro is not a good leaving group unless reduced to amine.

So, after nitration, reduce nitro to amine, then diazotize and substitute with ethoxy.

So:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl.

ii) nitration → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazonium.

v) H3O+, ethanol → substitute with ethoxy.

Then, perhaps perform another nitration to add another nitro group? But the target has only one nitro group.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so perhaps that's the plan.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option C or B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-butyl).

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate → nitro in a position directed by t-butyl and sulfonate.

iv) reduce nitro to amine.

v) diazotize → substitute with ethoxy.

vi) nitrate again.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, looking at option C's steps:

After adding t-butyl and sulfonate, nitration occurs. Then, nitro is reduced to amine.

Then, diazotize and nitrate again. That seems odd, but perhaps it's for adding another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A.

Option A's steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) diazo.

v) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH, EtBr → substitution.

vii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

viii) nitrate → nitro.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

But again, it's unclear.

Honestly, I'm a bit stuck. Based on the options and the substituent positions, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, because it introduces the substituents in a way that allows each step to place the groups correctly.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think about the nitro group being introduced last, as it's deactivating and would complicate further reactions.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Nitrate.

But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution where a leaving group is present, such as a nitro group.

So:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium salt.

4. Substitute with ethoxy → benzene with ethoxy.

5. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl → add t-butyl.

6. Nitrate → add nitro group.

But wait, after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, the ring is activated, so nitration would occur ortho or para to both.

But the target has nitro at a specific position. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitration would occur in a position that's meta to one and ortho to another.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps the correct option is option C, which includes steps that introduce the substituents in a way that allows each to be added in the correct position. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. I think I've spent enough time, and I'll go with option C as the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of the benzene ring. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH2CH3) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The order of introducing these substituents is critical because each group influences the positions of subsequent additions.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration introduces the nitro group. Since tert-butyl is an ortho/para director, the nitro group would likely be added at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para), not position 3 as required.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
4. Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution, but the sequence does not align with the desired substitution pattern. The nitro group at position 3 is inconsistent with the directing effects of the tert-butyl group.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group, which would be directed to the ortho or para position relative to the tert-butyl group, not position 3.
3. **Step iii**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine complicates the synthesis, as the target molecule retains the nitro group.
4. Further steps include diazotization, nitration, and substitution, but the sequence does not achieve the correct substitution pattern.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration introduces the nitro group. The sulfonic acid group directs the nitro group to the meta position relative to itself, which aligns with the target molecule's substitution pattern.
4. **Step iv**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine is inconsistent with the target molecule, as the nitro group must remain intact.
5. Subsequent steps involve diazotization, nitration, and substitution, but the sequence does not fully align with the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. However, Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) cannot proceed after nitration because the ring becomes deactivated and unreactive toward electrophilic substitution.
2. This sequence is invalid due to the incompatibility of nitration and Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

### Conclusion:
Option C comes closest to achieving the desired substitution pattern. The introduction of the tert-butyl group, followed by sulfonation and nitration, allows the nitro group to be placed at position 3. However, the reduction of the nitro group in step iv is inconsistent with the target molecule. Despite this issue, Option C is the most plausible sequence among the given options.
