Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, I think that "d" stands for deuterium. So, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? Or is it 1-bromo-benzene with a deuterium somewhere else? Wait, the formula should be C6H5Br with a deuterium on the adjacent position, so structure-wise, the bromine is on position 1, and a deuterium is on position 2.

Alright, so the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I recall that NaNH2 is used in elimination reactions, especially when dealing with halides. Since the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is aprotic and can act as a base. So, the bromide is probably going to leave, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, when the bromide leaves, what happens?

Wait, wait a second. Benzene rings are deactivating when there's a leaving group. So in aromatic substitution, positions are important. But in this case, is it a substitution or elimination? Wait, elimination reactions usually require adjacent H's to form a double bond. But on a benzene ring, elimination would lead to something else maybe?

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about the wrong reaction. Oh! Maybe this is about a benzyne intermediate. I remember that when a dihalobenzene undergoes dehalogenation with a strong base like NaNH2, it forms a benzyne (aryne) intermediate. But wait, in this case, we have only one bromine and a deuterium. Hmm. So, maybe the bromide leaves, and the deuterium is involved in some way?

Wait, if we have 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and we treat it with a strong base like NaNH2. So the base would abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine. Wait, but the adjacent position has a deuterium. Oh wait, wait a minute. The structure is bromine at position 1, deuterium at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent on the benzene ring.

So, when the base attacks, it might abstract a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (since position 2 is deuterated). Wait, but wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So, the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. So, the adjacent H's would be at positions 3 and 6, maybe? Because in benzene, each position has two adjacent carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Positions 1 is bromine. Position 2 is deuterium. Then, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. Position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. So, the H's adjacent to the Br (position 1) are at position 2 and 6. But position 2 has a deuterium, so position 6 has H's.

Wait, but the base is NaNH2, which is a strong base. It would abstract a proton that's adjacent to the leaving group (Br) to form a double bond. So, if the Br is at position 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 has deuterium, so the only available H is at position 6.

So, the base abstracts the H at position 6. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between position 1 and 2? Wait, but position 2 is deuterium. Hmm, that might complicate things. Or, maybe the deuterium is in a position that affects the elimination.

Wait, could it be that the deuterium is at position 2, but the base abstracts a proton from position 3? Because position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (which is deuterated). So, if H is abstracted from position 3, then elimination would form a double bond between 2 and 3. But wait, position 2 is deuterium, so that might not be feasible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I remember that when dihalobenzenes react with strong bases, they can lose two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond (aryne). But in this case, we only have one bromine and a deuterium. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the reaction is elimination of HBr. So, the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted from an adjacent position to form a double bond. But in benzene, forming a double bond would create a diradical or a triple bond? No, wait, elimination would form a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, which would be a benzyne.

Wait, but if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, when we eliminate H (from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1), we form a triple bond between 1 and 2? But position 2 is deuterium. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is in a position that doesn't affect the elimination. So, the base abstracts a proton from position 6. Then, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 2. But then, position 2 has deuterium, meaning that the triple bond is between 1 and 2, which are C-D and C-C? That doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is not involved in the elimination. So, the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6? No, wait, that's not adjacent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is benzene with Br at C1 and D at C2. So the structure is:

Br
|
C1 - C2(D) - C3
       |      |
       C6    C4
      /      \
     C5      C6 ?

Wait, no, benzene is a ring. So, positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), and the rest are H's.

So, when the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, that would be either position 2 (D) or position 6. Since position 2 is D, the only available H is position 6.

So, abstracting H from position 6: Br leaves, and we form a double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but then that would leave a triple bond? No, wait, elimination here would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. So, the structure would be:

   C1≡C6
   /   \
C2(D) ... C5 etc.

Wait, but that's a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, which would form a benzyne (aryne) structure. So, the product would be 1,2-dideutero-benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no, because position 2 has D, but the triple bond is between 1 and 6? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, wait, maybe the elimination leads to a triple bond between C1 and C2. But since position 2 has a D, that would mean C1-C2 has a triple bond, but C2 is D. So, would that be a C≡C-D structure? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction actually doesn't form a triple bond. Maybe it's a substitution instead. But wait, under such conditions, substitution with what? Because there's no incoming nucleophile except possibly the ammonia.

Wait, no, NaNH2 is a strong base but not a nucleophile. So, more likely elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but in aromatic systems, elimination would require adjacent H and X. So, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and we eliminate HBr, that would give a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2. But C2 has a D, so it would be C1-C2 where C2 is deuterium. So, the product would be a deuterated benzyne.

But how many products are possible? Because the benzyne can form in different positions?

Wait, no, in this case, the only possible elimination is between C1 (Br) and either C2 (D) or C6. But since C2 is D, the base can only abstract H from C6. So, the benzyne would have the triple bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but that's not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think of the benzene ring. Suppose we have positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), and 6 (H). The adjacent positions to Br (position 1) are 2 and 6. So, only position 6 has H available for abstraction. So the base abstracts H from 6, and Br leaves, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6? But that's not adjacent. Oh wait, the triple bond is between 1 and 6? No, that's across the ring, which isn't possible because triple bonds are between adjacent atoms.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. If the H is abstracted from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But that's two positions apart on the ring, which isn't directly adjacent. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is in position 2, but the base abstracts a proton from position 3. Because position 3 is adjacent to position 2. Then, elimination would form a triple bond between 2 and 3. But position 2 has a deuterium. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the base can abstract a proton from position 3, leading to elimination between C2 and C3. But C2 has a D, so the triple bond would be between C2 and C3, with C2 being D. So, the triple bond would be C-D≡C-C? That doesn't make sense either.

Wait a minute, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the base can abstract a proton either from position 3 or position 6. Let me see.

So, the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so no H available. So the only available H is at position 6. So the base abstracts H from 6, and Br leaves, leading to formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6? But that would require the triple bond to be between two non-adjacent positions, which isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me number the benzene ring correctly. Let's imagine the benzene ring as follows:

Positions 1 (top), 2 (top-right), 3 (bottom-right), 4 (bottom), 5 (bottom-left), 6 (top-left).

So, position 1 is Br, position 2 is D. The adjacent positions to 1 are 2 (D) and 6 (H). So, the base can abstract H from position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6? Wait, but that's not possible because 1 and 6 are adjacent in the ring. So, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6 would require a direct bond between those two positions, which are adjacent, so that's possible.

So, the product would be benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 6, and a D at position 2. But wait, benzene is a ring, so if we have a triple bond between 1 and 6, that's a single position. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne formed would have the triple bond between positions 1 and 2? Because the base abstracted H from 6, which is adjacent to 1, but that's on the opposite side of the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 2, but since position 2 has a D, that would lead to a unique product.

Wait, but if the deuterium is at position 2, and the triple bond is between 1 and 2, the product would be 1,2-dideutero-benzyne? Or would it be a single product.

Wait, another angle: how many different products can form? If the elimination leads to a single benzyne structure, then only one product. But if there are multiple possible positions for the triple bond, then more products.

But in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. The only possible H abstraction is from position 6, leading to triple bond between 1 and 6. Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so triple bond between 1 and 6. But position 6 is not deuterated, so the product would be 1,6-dideutero benzene with a triple bond?

Wait, no, because the D is only at position 2. So, in the product, position 2 is D, position 1 is where the Br was, and the triple bond is between 1 and 6. So the structure is benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 6, and a D at position 2.

So, that would be a single product because the elimination can only occur in one way. So, the product is a single organic compound, so the number of possible products is 1.

But wait, another possibility: does the benzyne have two possible structures (ortho or para), but in this case, the Br is only on one position, so maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, no. Benzyne is a symmetric molecule, but if the deuterium is present, then the positions matter. But in our case, the triple bond can only form between 1 and 6 because that's where the H was abstracted. So, the product is unique.

But wait, wait. After elimination, the structure would have a triple bond between 1 and 2 if the H was abstracted from 2, but position 2 is D. So, cannot abstract H from 2. So, the triple bond has to be between 1 and 6, but position 6 is not deuterated. So, the product would have a triple bond between 1 and 6 and a D at position 2.

Wait, but wait, the elimination requires the H and X to be on adjacent carbons. So, the H is on 6, which is adjacent to Br on 1, so elimination leads to a triple bond between 1 and 6. So, the structure would be a triple bond between 1 and 6, and a D on 2. So, that's a single product.

So, only one product is formed. So, the answer is option B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH2 is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring.

In this reaction, the bromine at position 1 acts as the leaving group. The strong base NaNH2 abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine to facilitate elimination. The adjacent positions to bromine (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. However, position 2 is deuterated, leaving only position 6 as the available site for proton abstraction.

When the proton at position 6 is abstracted, the bromine leaves, and a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6. This results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 and a deuterium at position 2. Since the reaction can only proceed in this specific manner, only one unique product is formed.

Thus, the number of possible organic products in this reaction is **1**.
