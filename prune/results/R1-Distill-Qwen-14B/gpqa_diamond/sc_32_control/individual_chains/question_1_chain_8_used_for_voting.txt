Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about two energy levels and their lifetimes, and we're supposed to figure out the energy difference needed to distinguish them clearly.

Hmm, the problem states that the lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds for E1 and 10^-8 seconds for E2. Wait, no, wait, correction: the question says they have lifetimes of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec respectively. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, no, the question says the two states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds. So, state E1 has a shorter lifetime than E2. 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its energy uncertainty. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

But wait, wait. Another approach: the energy levels have certain lifetimes, which relates to their natural linewidth or the uncertainty in energy. The broader the energy (the larger ΔE), the shorter the lifetime. So the lifetime is inversely proportional to the energy uncertainty.

The energy uncertainty is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to their respective lifetimes.

Wait, but we're being asked about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So, to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the combined uncertainty, their peaks might overlap, making them indistinguishable.

So, let me compute the uncertainties for each state. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert ħ into eV·seconds. I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218 × 10^-19 joules. So, ħ in eV·s is ħ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) = approximately 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for state E1, with τ1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, state E2 has τ2 = 1e-8 seconds:
ΔE2 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, that's interesting. So E1 has a larger uncertainty because its lifetime is shorter. So, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is around 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Because τ2 is larger, so ΔE2 is smaller. Correct.

So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two levels would merge into a single peak, making them indistinct.

So, the minimum energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute that sum.

ΔE1 is approximately 6.58e-7 eV.
ΔE2 is approximately 6.58e-8 eV.

Adding those together: 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be more than 7.24e-7 eV for the two states to be clearly resolved.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001e-6 eV, which is way smaller than 7e-7. So no, that's too small.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller, so definitely no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 7e-7 eV. So yes, this would be sufficient. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00001e-4 eV. Wait, wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. So 1e-8 eV is about 0.00000001 eV, which is less than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.000000724 eV). So option D is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than the required 0.000000724 eV. So it's insufficient.

So the only option that's larger than 7.24e-7 eV is option C: 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 7.24e-7.

Wait, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the sum.

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.
ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.
Sum: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = (6.582 + 0.6582) * 1e-7 = 7.2402e-7 eV.

So the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. The energy difference must be greater than this. So the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is 0.001e-6 → 0.000001 eV. Way smaller than 0.000000724 eV. No.

B) 1e-11 → way smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV → which is 0.1 milli-eV. Definitely larger than 7.24e-7.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → smaller than 7.24e-7.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says "clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So perhaps the energy difference needs to be much larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or just larger? I think the standard approach is that the energy difference should be at least the sum of the uncertainties. So, any option larger than the sum is acceptable.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So it's acceptable.

But looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 10^-4 eV. That's much larger than the required sum.

Alternatively, if the question was about the difference in lifetimes, but wait no, the question is about the energy difference.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Correct.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

For τ2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Sum is about 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. So the options are:

C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 microvolts = 100 microvolts.

Wait, but 1e-4 eV is 100 micro-eV. 7.24e-7 eV is 0.724 micro-eV. So yes, 100 micro-eV is way larger than 0.724 micro-eV.

So the only possible option that is larger than 7.24e-7 eV is option C.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state:  

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).  

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E \)) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Adding the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-9} = 0.000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-11} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-4} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-8} = 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for clear distinguishability is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
