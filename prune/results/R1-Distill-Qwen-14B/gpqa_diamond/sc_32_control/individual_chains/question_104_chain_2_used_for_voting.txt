Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. So the star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are about the same mass. Both planets have circular orbits.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for velocity semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since the planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so that term goes away. Also, since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_* is much bigger than M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star, same for both stars.

So the formula simplifies. Let me think, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_* )^(1/3) ) divided by P^(1/3). Wait, no, let me get the exact formula.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p) * (1 / (M_*))^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

But wait, no, more accurately, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since the two stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_* is the same for both. And the planets have the same mass (Neptune), so M_p is same. Also, assuming the inclination i is same (which isn't stated, but since the method detects planets regardless, but maybe we can assume sin i is same or average out).

So if K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3), then the ratio of K between the two planets will be inversely proportional to the cube root of the period ratio.

Wait, but wait, the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K. So K is higher when the planet's orbit causes more movement in the star. So if K is higher, that could mean either a more massive planet, a shorter orbital period, etc.

In this case, the shift is 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but what's the connection between the spectral line shift and K? The shift is caused by the Doppler effect. The velocity is proportional to the shift, so the velocity K is proportional to the shift divided by the wavelength of the spectral line.

But wait, the same spectral line is used, right? So the shift in wavelength (Δλ) is proportional to velocity (v) via v = c * Δλ / λ. So the velocity is proportional to Δλ.

So K1 (planet 1) is proportional to 5, K2 (planet 2) is proportional to 7. So K2 = (7/5) * K1.

But earlier, I thought K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, let's correct that. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, no, maybe you have it another way. Alternatively, another version of the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because:

K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3)) )

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 = (7/5) K1.

From the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 = (7/5) K1, then the ratio of P2 to P1 can be found.

Let me write the equation.

K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Dividing K2 by K1 gives:

K2/K1 = [ C / P2^(1/3) ] / [ C / P1^(1/3) ] = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We can rewrite this as (P2/P1) = (K2/K1)^(-3)

So (K2/K1) = 7/5 = 1.4

So (P2/P1) = (1.4)^(-3) = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, so P2 is shorter than P1? But wait, if K is higher, the star's velocity is higher, which would imply a shorter period. Because for a given planet mass, a shorter period would require the star to move more quickly. That makes sense. Because a planet orbiting closer in (shorter period) would cause the star to move more rapidly in response.

So in this case, planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), so its period is shorter. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.364, so P1 is longer. Wait no, the question is P2's period compared to P1's. So if P2 is shorter, then P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the answer would be that P2 is ~0.36 times P1, so the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So it's P2 / P1 = 0.36. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times planet #1's. So it's shorter.

So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the math. Because I think I might have mixed up the ratio.

We have K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

From earlier, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So 1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(1.4)^3 = P1/P2

1.4^3 is 2.744.

So P1/P2 = 2.744 → P2 = P1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.364 times planet #1's period. So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So 0.364 times longer, which is the same as saying P2 is shorter. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to the ratio of the planet's mass to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets with the same mass and host stars of the same mass, the ratio of their velocity semi-amplitudes \( K_2 / K_1 \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \):

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, the spectral line shifts for the two planets are proportional to their velocity semi-amplitudes, with \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
1.4 = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
1.4^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
2.744 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1}{2.744} \approx 0.364 \, P_1
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about **0.36 times longer** than that of planet #1.
