Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it one part at a time.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework, but I'm not exactly sure about the positions.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it usually leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene via the E2 mechanism. So, I think this is an elimination reaction. The product would be an alkene.

The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are often oily or crystalline, and elimination reactions produce such products. The 1H NMR spectrum has some specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. That's probably a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an epoxide or something else. Wait, no, wait. Wait, KOH and dibromide usually gives an elimination product. Oh, but wait, sometimes in certain conditions, like if the base is not strong enough, maybe it's a substitution? No, KOH is a strong base and heat favors elimination. So the product would be adamantylene, perhaps an alkene.

Wait, but the product is called product 1. Let me think about the NMR data. The triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a bit upfield for an alkene, but wait, what else could that be? Oh, maybe an ether? Or perhaps it's the result of a different reaction. Wait, another thought: when KOH reacts with a dihalide, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene, and maybe some other functional group. 

Wait, the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Hmm, that complicates things. So elimination reaction would not give a carbonyl. Oh, wait wait, maybe I'm wrong. Could it be a substitution reaction? Because sometimes, if the base is not strong enough, or maybe an SN2 reaction could happen. But with two bromine atoms, it's more likely to undergo elimination. Wait, unless it's a ring-opening scenario.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's a bridge structure. Heating with KOH might cause ring-opening. Oh, but I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but something else.

Wait, another approach: the product's IR has a carbonyl. So, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Wait, wait, maybe it's a ketone. How could that happen? If it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by an acid workup? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination forming a ketone through some rearrangement.

Wait, let's think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two adjacent bromines. So, when KOH is added, it would likely abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But then where's the carbonyl group coming from?

Wait, perhaps it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes. Unless it's a conjugated system. Wait, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Like, perhaps, after elimination, a carbonyl forms because of the structure of adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,2-elimination and a 1,3-elimination. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. Maybe it's a substitution. But with two leaving groups (two bromines), maybe it's a double substitution. But substitution of both Br's would require a strong base. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that substitution leads to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination forms a carbonyl because the adjacent Br's are in a position that forms a ketone upon elimination. Wait, I'm not very clear on this.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data. The triplet at 4.79 (2H) could be a methylene next to an oxygen, like an epoxide, but wait, that's typically around 3.5-4.5, but maybe in a strained ring it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an ester. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe an ester? Or a ketone.

Wait a second, the IR absorption at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, which is indicative of a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. But an aldehyde's carbonyl is higher, around 1720, but more upfield in the NMR. Wait, but in the NMR, the triplet at 4.79 is 2H. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is a diketone or a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a lactone or something similar. Hmm, perhaps the product is adamantanone, which is a ketone. Wait, but how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe the KOH causes a ring-opening via elimination. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, loses two equivalents of HBr, forming a ketone. Wait, because if the two Brs are adjacent, elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in this case, the structure leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is a quaternary carbon. So, if the Brs are on bridgehead carbons, eliminating HBr from each may form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible because of Bredt's rule. So, perhaps instead, the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol-type elimination. But pinacol elimination involves 1,2-diols eliminating to form a carbonyl. Hmm, but the starting material here is a dihalide, not a diol.

Wait, perhaps the Brs are in a position such that elimination can't form a bridgehead double bond, so instead, the ring breaks, and a carbonyl group forms. Hmm, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, unless it's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a carbonyl compound. So perhaps product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts acylation?

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl. So product 2 is possibly a ketone that undergoes some kind of cycloaddition or alkylation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it forms an enol ether or undergoes some kind of ring expansion. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or another elimination.

Wait, not sure. Let's think about the next step. Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be the result of cleaving any double bonds in product 2.

But wait, product 2 is formed from product 1 and Al isopropoxide. So product 1 is a ketone, and after treatment with Al isopropoxide, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or maybe undergoes some alkylation.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is a dienone or something that upon ozonolysis would yield specific fragments.

Wait, going back to the initial product 1: the NMR data shows four groups. The triplet at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H integrating to 10H, which is a lot), 1.94 (2H). So 10H in a multiplet around 2.4-2.23 suggests perhaps a bridge structure, like adamantane, which has many equivalent CH groups.

So, putting it together: Product 1's NMR is 4.79 (2H, triplet), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So the 10H suggests a structure with multiple equivalent CH groups, perhaps the adamantane skeleton. The triplet at 4.79 (2H) could be a methylene next to an oxygen, like an epoxide. But then the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another angle: maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ether. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. For example, if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, and the resulting structure forms a carbonyl group because of the structure. So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, loses two HBr molecules to form an adamantanone (a ketone within the adamantane structure). That would explain the carbonyl in IR.

So, product 1 is adamantanone. Then, product 2 is made by heating with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts, but adamantanone is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation or alkylation. Wait, maybe it's a ring expansion? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is used in a different reaction, like a Claisen rearrangement or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene. Wait, but product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, not a C=C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ether with a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe it's an ester? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and when ozonized, product 3 would have carbonyls. But let me think about the structure.

Wait, let me try to outline the possible reactions:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl)
   - Probably an elimination to form a ketone, such as adamantanone.

2. Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2
   - Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's used to form an enol ether or promote some kind of alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's a dienophile.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, a conjugated dienone. Because then, ozonolysis would break the double bonds.

Wait, but if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a triene or some other structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: product 3 comes from ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene (two double bonds) would result in multiple carbonyl groups. But the question is about the coupling of the most deshielded H in product 3's NMR.

Ok, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. But let's think about the structure.

Wait, in product 3, after ozonolysis and workup, any double bonds would be cleaved. So, any H's adjacent to these would be split based on their neighboring H's.

Wait, for example, if product 2 has a double bond like CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would split into two carbonyls. But in the case of a more complex structure, like a bridge, the splitting could be different.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis might break one of the rings, leading to a structure with carbonyl groups.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H would be near electronegative groups, like carbonyls. For example, H's adjacent to carbonyls would be deshielded.

In the coupling pattern, the number of neighboring H's determines the splitting. So, if a H is adjacent to two H's, it would be a triplet. If adjacent to three H's, a quartet, etc.

Wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. Assuming it's near a carbonyl, maybe it's a methylene group next to a carbonyl.

If it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the H's on that CH2 would couple with adjacent H's. For example, if the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with two H's, then each H on the CH2 would split into a triplet of triplets because each H is split by two neighboring H's on adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group adjacent to another CH with two H's. So, each H would be split into a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of an allylic system, but after ozonolysis, the structure might have a conjugated system that's been broken.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure with two carbonyl groups and some CH2 groups in between. For example, if product 2 was a diene like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but more likely, it's a bridged structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene within the adamantane framework. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would form two ketones, and the resulting structure would have adjacent CH2 groups next to the carbonyls.

In that case, the H's on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Each of these H's would couple with the two H's on the neighboring CH2 group. So each H would be split into a triplet due to coupling with two H's on the adjacent CH2.

But wait, another possibility: the CH2 group next to the carbonyl could be adjacent to a CH group. For example, if the structure is O=C-R-CH2-O=C=O, then the CH2 would be next to a CH, which has two H's. So each H on the CH2 would couple with both H's on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. But if there's another adjacent group with H's, it could split further.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like (CH2)2(C=O), so the H's on each CH2 would be next to each other. Each H on the CH2 would see two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H's are next to a CH group, then each H would see two H's from that group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but let's think about the specific options given. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the H is next to a CH2 group, each H on the H2 would couple with two H's, leading to a triplet. So the most deshielded H (like on a CH2 next to a carbonyl) would be a triplet.

But wait, what if the H is next to two different groups? For example, if the H is on a CH2 that's between two different groups each with two H's, then each H would be split by two H's on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to a CH group which is itself adjacent to another CH group, the coupling could be different.

Wait, perhaps the structure in product 3 is such that the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to two CH groups. Each CH has two H's. So each H on the CH2 would couple with two H's on each adjacent CH, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of an ABX system, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the specific reaction steps.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. The IR shows a carbonyl, so probably a ketone. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single ketone formed via elimination.

Wait, another way: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, may lose two HBr molecules to form a double bond. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening elimination. So, if the Brs are on bridgehead carbons, elimination could form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether with a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Anyway, moving on. Product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound. Then, product 1 is heated with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, which isn't typically a good acylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, and the Al isopropoxide helps in some kind of enolate formation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and the Al isopropoxide is used to form a more complex structure, like a dienone.

Wait, perhaps the product 2 is a dienone, and then ozonolysis would break the double bonds.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let's try to think about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ozonolysis would give two ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substitution.

But in this case, product 2 comes from product 1 and Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enol ether or something similar), which upon ozonolysis would form a diketone.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated dienone would result in cleavage at the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break it into a chain with two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H in product 3 is on a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 3 has a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the H's on the central CH2 would be next to two CH2 groups each with two H's. So each H would split into a triplet, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

But in that case, each H on the CH2 would be a triplet due to coupling with two H's on each adjacent CH2. So the splitting would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group's H would see two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to carbonyl) would have a triplet coupling pattern.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH group adjacent to another CH group with two H's, such as CH2-CH(CH2), then the H's on the CH would be split by the two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are other couplings, like with another group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. In that case, each H on the CH2 would couple with two H's from the adjacent CH group and two from another group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2-CH2-C=O, then the CH2 near the carbonyl would have each H coupling with two H's from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So each H on the CH2 would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2-CH(CH2)-C=O, then each H on the CH2 would couple with the single H on the CH and the two H's on the adjacent CH2. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, perhaps. Or a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Product 1: after KOH, it's a ketone. Let's say it's adamantanone.

Product 2: treated with Al(i-Pr)3. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantanone isn't a typical acylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps Al(i-Pr)3 helps in forming an enol ether. Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and Al(i-Pr)3 induces some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienol ether, and Al(i-Pr)3 is used in a hydride shift or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, considering that product 2 is formed upon heating with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis at -78°C would typically give ozonides that don't break down into carbonyls. Hmm, no, wait, ozonolysis is usually followed by workup. Oh, the question says after ozonolysis, dimethylsulfide is added, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes or ketones, not breaking into acids or other groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Assuming product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls, and the resulting structure would have CH2 groups between them.

So, for example, if product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups, but in a more complex structure, maybe something like OHC-(CH2)n-CHO.

But the actual structure would depend on the starting material.

Wait, but if product 2 is a bridge structure with a double bond, ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond, and ozonolysis would open it into a chain with two carbonyls.

In any case, the most deshielded H in product 3 would be near a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure is something like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O.

The H's on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Each H on the CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would see two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the H is on a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, CH2-CH2-C=O. The H on the CH2 next to C=O would have two H's on the same CH2 and two on the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with four H's, leading to a quintet (pentet), but that's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group adjacent to another CH group, each with two H's. So each H would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. But if there are two neighboring groups, it could be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2-...), then the H on the CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH group, leading to a triplet. If the CH group is also adjacent to another group with H's, the splitting could be more complex.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the options, I think the most likely answer is that the coupling pattern is a triplet (option A), as the H is adjacent to two H's on an adjacent CH2 group.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C leads to an elimination reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that two equivalents of HBr are eliminated, forming a ketone. The most likely product is adamantanone, a ketone within the adamantane framework. The ¹H NMR data supports this: the triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could correspond to a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen or another functional group, while the multiplet at 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H) and the signal at 1.94 ppm (2H) are consistent with the adamantane skeleton.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Product 1 (adamantanone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid. This step likely induces a rearrangement or forms a reactive intermediate, such as an enol ether or a conjugated dienone (product 2). The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred to contain a double bond or reactive site that can undergo ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis and Workup**:  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. This forms product 3, which contains carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it highly deshielded in the NMR spectrum.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern. This matches the description of the splitting due to the interaction with two equivalent neighboring hydrogens.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with the CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, where each hydrogen interacts with two equivalent hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled with two sets of non-equivalent hydrogens, which is not supported by the structure.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two different sets of hydrogens, which is not applicable here.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not the case here.

The most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet. 

**Answer: A**
