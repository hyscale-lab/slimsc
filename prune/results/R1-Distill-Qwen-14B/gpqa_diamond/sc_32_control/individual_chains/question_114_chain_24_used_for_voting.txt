Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's see if I can figure this out.

The problem has two parts, right? Let me read it again. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second part is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treating it with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find out what reagents A and B are from the options given.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is a ketone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that typically, the nitrile would act as a nucleophile. Wait, but ketones usually undergo nucleophilic addition, right? So maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone would undergo some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2-CN attached? Hmm, not sure. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be: CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

Wait, but another thought: maybe it's a condensation reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: perhaps it's the formation of an imine or something, but no, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: I think when a ketone reacts with HCN, it can form a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. The reaction is where a ketone reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin. The product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

So the mechanism is: the ketone, under acidic conditions, gets protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- from HCN attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the leaving group (water) departs, and the structure rearranges to form the alcohol and nitrile groups adjacent to each other.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and A. So NaCN is providing the CN- as a nucleophile, but maybe the acid is needed as a catalyst. So, A could be H3O+ (acid), which would protonate the ketone, making it more reactive.

So for the first part, A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Option B is A=H3O+ and B=CH3COOH. Option C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about yet.

So if A is H3O+, that would make the first part correct for options A and B.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to form the corresponding acid. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Hmm, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? Well, nitriles can be oxidized. Common oxidizing agents for this include KMnO4 under certain conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents in acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, but the reagent here is B, which is H2O. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Unless B is an aqueous solution with something else? Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction under specific conditions.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For example, under strong acidic conditions, a nitrile can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Or, under basic conditions, it might form an amide, which can then be acidified.

Wait, so if the reagent is H2O, maybe it's a hydrolysis. But when you hydrolyze nitriles, you usually need an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or another strong acid.

Wait, but looking at the question, the second reaction is: the nitrile compound is treated with B, which is H2O. So that suggests that B is some aqueous solution, perhaps with an acid or base as a catalyst.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. Or wait, sometimes nitriles are hydrolyzed in the presence of H2O and an acid catalyst to form the carboxylic acid.

But wait, another possibility: if the nitrile is in a position where it's adjacent to an alcohol group (like in the starting material), maybe it's an intramolecular reaction.

Wait, but in any case, the process would require an acid. So for the second reaction, reagent B is probably either HCl or CH3COOH, acting as an acid catalyst.

Looking back at the options, when B is either HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). Let me think about which one is more likely.

Wait, when HCN is used, it's usually in acidic conditions. For hydrolysis of nitriles, strong acids like HCl can be used. Alternatively, using a weaker acid like acetic acid might also work, but perhaps under higher temperatures or longer reaction times.

Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a possibility for the first reaction. Wait, but earlier I thought A is H3O+ for the first part, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another thought. In the first reaction, perhaps the reagent A is not H3O+. Let me think again.

Wait, but the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So the product is a cyanohydrin. To form a cyanohydrin, you typically use an acid catalyst, like H3O+. So A should be an acid, such as H3O+.

So that would suggest that the first part (A) is H3O+, so options A and B are candidates.

Now for the second part, the nitrile group is being oxidized or hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The reagent is H2O and B.

Wait, another possibility is that the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for this are either H2O with HCl (like conc. HCl) under reflux, or using a peracid, but that's more for epoxidation.

Wait, another approach: the nitrile group can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under strongly acidic conditions, such as with HCl. So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. Option B has B as CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would that be sufficient to hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid? Or would it require a stronger acid like HCl?

I think HCl would be a stronger acid, so that would be necessary for the hydrolysis. So for the second part, B is HCl.

So putting it together, A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The first reaction uses H3O+ as the catalyst for cyanohydrin formation, which is correct. The second reaction uses HCl as the acid for nitrile hydrolysis to the acid.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct option is A.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the ketone, making it more electrophilic, and facilitate the nucleophilic attack by CN-. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺, which acts as the acid catalyst.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires a strong acid catalyst, such as HCl, to ensure the reaction proceeds efficiently. Therefore, reagent B is likely HCl.

From the options provided:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl — This matches the analysis for both reactions.
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH — While H₃O⁺ is correct for A, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less suitable for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl — NaHSO₃ is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, making this option incorrect.
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH — Both A and B are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
