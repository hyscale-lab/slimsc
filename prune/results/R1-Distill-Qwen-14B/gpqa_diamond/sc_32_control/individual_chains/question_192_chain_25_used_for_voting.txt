Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the cavity's center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So imagine a big sphere, and inside it, a smaller sphere-shaped hole, but the center of that hole isn't exactly at the center of the big sphere—it's shifted by s. And since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. Now, the question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find E at point P. Let me try to visualize this setup. The conductor is uncharged initially, but when a charge is placed inside the cavity, things change. I remember that when a charge is inside a conductor's cavity, it induces charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right! For a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity (like this +q) will induce equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface will have charges induced due to any external fields or other factors. But in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged, so the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q because the total charge of the conductor must be zero. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, the conductor is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have an induced -q. Then, because the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q. Or wait, no—that would sum to zero? Let me think. If the cavity has +q, the inner conductor surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner's -q. So yes, the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the net charge is zero. So putting +q inside the cavity makes the inner surface have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner, so the conductor's total is (-q + q) = 0. Got it.

Now, what's the electric field outside the conductor at point P? Since P is outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. Because, for a spherical conductor, the external field depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the conductor. So for points outside, the field depends on the total charge enclosed by that Gaussian surface.

Wait, but wait—the conductor has its own charges, but how about the cavity's charge? Hmm, I remember that charges inside the cavity affect the inner surface but not the outer. So for any point outside the conductor, the field is due to the charge on the conductor's outer surface. So the outer surface has +q, so the field outside would be like that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. The charge in the cavity is +q, which induces a -q on the inner surface. The conductor's own charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q. So the total charge outside is +q. So when you look at a point outside the conductor, the field is as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the conductor itself is a sphere. So any external point would have the field as if the charge were at the center. So regardless of where the cavity is placed, as long as it's inside, the external field is the same.

Wait a minute, but in this problem, the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. The center of the cavity is s away from the conductor's center. So does that arrangement affect the external field?

Hmm. Let me think. The conductor is a sphere, so symmetry plays a role here. When the cavity is off-center, the induced charges on the inner surface won't be uniformly distributed. The inner surface will have a dipole-like distribution because the cavity is shifted. But wait, for the conductor, the charges rearrange to cancel the electric field within the conductor. So the field inside the conductor is zero.

But when considering the outer surface, since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface remains spherically symmetric. Wait, is that true? Because the inner surface is no longer symmetric due to the cavity being off-center, but the conductor as a whole must have a symmetric outer surface if it's a sphere. Or does it?

Wait, the conductor is a sphere. Even if the cavity is off-center, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform because any asymmetry in the inner charge distribution doesn't affect the outer surface's symmetry. Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface will distribute uniformly, regardless of the inner arrangement. Because any external field would cause the outer charges to arrange to cancel the field inside the conductor, but in this case, there's no external field initially. Wait, maybe the conductor's outer surface remains uniformly distributed as if it's a point charge at the center, regardless of the inner cavity's charge arrangement.

So, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field would be due to the total charge of the conductor, which is +q (as the outer surface has +q). So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r², where r is the distance from the center.

Wait, but the point P in this problem is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the conductor's charge is +q, and point P is outside, so the field is as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but the options don't all match that. Let's look at the options.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That's the same as what I just thought. Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l². Hmm, l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. Oh, but the field outside the conductor doesn't depend on the cavity's position because the conductor's charge is on the outer surface, and the conductor is spherical. So it should be based on the distance from the conductor's center, which is L.

Wait, but why is l given? Because the problem says that l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity, and s is the distance between the two centers. Hmm, perhaps the problem is trying to trick us into thinking about the cavity's position, but in reality, the conductor's symmetry makes the external field depend only on the conductor's total charge and the distance from its center.

So the correct answer would be option B, which is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Is the conductor really a conductor? Because if the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has a charge +q, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q. So the conductor as a whole has zero charge, but the outer surface has +q. So the total charge inside the conductor is zero (since it's neutral), but the outer surface has +q. So when you're outside the conductor, the field will be that of a +q charge at the center. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity? Does the fact that the cavity is off-center affect the external field? I don't think so because the conductor's outer surface charge distribution is uniform. The inner surface is not uniform, but the outer surface is, due to the conductor's spherical symmetry. So the external field behaves as if the charge were at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the cavity is placed inside.

So that would make option B correct.

But wait, let me think about another approach. Let's imagine a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, at radius L. The flux through this surface would be due to the total enclosed charge within it. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the flux is (q_enclosed) / (ε₀) = q/(ε₀), so E * 4πL² = q/(ε₀), so E = q/(4πε₀ L²). That matches option B.

So yeah, the correct answer is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to maintain overall neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor has a total charge $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. This is due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, which ensures that the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform.

3. **Effect of Cavity Position**: The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. However, the position of the cavity does not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which remains uniform due to the conductor's spherical symmetry.

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   This matches the form of option B.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The distance $(l - s \cos\theta)$ does not describe the relevant distance for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The distance $(l + s \cos\theta)$ is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the distance $l$ is given, the electric field outside the conductor depends on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
