Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. But their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The host stars are different. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, so if the host stars have the same radius but different masses, that might affect their densities or luminosities, but maybe not the transit probability directly.

The question is about the probability of transit, right? So, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But I think it's more about the orbital geometry. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher if the star is bigger, but wait, no, stars' sizes affect the depth of the transit, not the probability. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet), because for the planet's orbit to cross our line of sight, the orbital plane must be edge-on. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, assuming random orientation. Or maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by the square root of something else? I might be mixing some formulas here.

Wait, no, I think the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability of this alignment is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), assuming that the orbits are randomly oriented. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think the probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet), because the planet's orbit must be within a certain cone for the transit to occur. So, the larger the semi-major axis (distance from star), the less likely the transit. So, closer-in planets have higher probability.

Wait, but let me think about how the semi-major axis relates to orbital period. Using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, M_star dominates. So P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). So, a³ = P² * M_star. So a is proportional to (P² * M_star)^(1/3).

So, for Planet_1, P1 is (P2)/3. Since the period is shorter, a1 is ( (P2² /9) * M1 )^(1/3). M1 is twice M2. So a1³ = ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * 2 M2 ) ) = ( P2² * 2 M2 ) /9. Whereas a2³ would be (P2² * M2 ). So a1 is cube root of [ (2/9) * a2³ ].

Wait, let me compute a1 and a2. Let's denote a1 = k * a2, where k is a factor.

a1³ = (P1² * M1) = ( (P2/3)^2 ) * (2 M2) ) = ( P2² * 2 M2 ) / 9.

a2³ = (P2² * M2 )

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ => a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.63.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is. Hmm, so that would mean that Planet_1 has a smaller a, so higher a_planet is better for transit probability? Wait, no, the probability is (R_star / a). So since a1 is smaller, R_star / a1 is larger, so higher probability.

Wait, but wait, both stars have the same radius. So R_star is same for both.

So, transit probability for each planet is proportional to (R_star / a). Since a1 is less than a2, R_star/a1 is bigger than R_star/a2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

But wait, their masses are same, but the host stars have different masses. How does that affect? Oh, because Kepler's law involves the star's mass. So already considered that in the a calculation.

So, in terms of transit probability, Planet_1 is closer, so higher probability.

But wait, the question says they have the same radii. So R_star is same for both. So R_star_planet1 = R_star_planet2.

So, probability for planet_1 is (R_star / a1), and for planet_2, (R_star / a2). So, since a1 is smaller, the ratio is larger.

So, transit probability is inversely proportional to a.

So, the probability for planet_1 is (R/a1) = R/(a2 * 0.63) ≈ 1.589 * (R/a2). Because a1 is approx 0.63 a2. So (1/0.63) is about 1.589.

So, planet_1's probability is about 1.589 times higher than planet_2's.

Wait, but the options don't have that number. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.
B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.
C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

Wait, so according to my calculation, planet_1's probability is approximately 1.589 times that of planet_2. So, planet_1's probability is higher, so they'd prefer observing planet_1. Looking at the options, C says 1.65 times, which is close to 1.59. So option C would be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute a1 and a2 more accurately.

Given:

P1 = P2 /3.

M1 = 2 M2.

So, a1^3 = (P1^2 * M1) / ( (4π²/G) ) → but since a2^3 = (P2^2 * M2) / same term, so a1^3 = ( (P2/3)^2 ) * (2 M2) ) → a1^3 = (P2² * 2 M2) ) /9 = (2/9) * (P2² M2) → a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 R/(a2).

So, the transit probability for planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of planet_2. So planet_1 is preferred, and the probability is about 1.65 times higher. So option C is correct.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a_{\text{planet}} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), so the probability depends on the semi-major axis of each planet's orbit.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}} \), we calculate the semi-major axes of the two planets. For Planet_1, the orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), and the host star's mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \). Substituting these values:

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{P_1^2 M_1}{k} = \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 (2M_2)}{k} = \frac{2P_2^2 M_2}{9k}.
\]

For Planet_2:

\[
a_2^3 = \frac{P_2^2 M_2}{k}.
\]

Thus, \( a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9} a_2^3 \), and taking the cube root gives:

\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606 \), we find \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the transit probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
\text{Probability}_1 \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1} \approx \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{0.606a_2} \approx 1.65 \cdot \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}.
\]

For Planet_2, the probability is \( \text{Probability}_2 \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2} \). Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this, the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1.

Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
