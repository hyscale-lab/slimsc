Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z. Let me try to remember what I know about uncertainties and operators.

The problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so I guess that means the state is expressed in the P_z basis.

Wait, to find the uncertainty in P_z, I need to compute the standard deviation. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, let's find ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of the state vector corresponds to the amplitude of a particular eigenstate. The eigenvalues of P_z are given by the diagonal elements of its matrix. Looking at P_z's matrix:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0] → so the first basis vector has eigenvalue ħ.
Second row: [0,0,0] → but wait, that's zero?
Third row: [0,0,-ħ] → eigenvalue is -ħ.

Wait, the second row of P_z is all zeros except the diagonal, which is zero. So the eigenvalues for P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ? Hmm, wait no, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues for each basis vector. So the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates.

The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So each component is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate of P_z.

So when calculating ⟨P_z⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

The components are c1 = -1/2, c2=1/√2, c3=-1/2. The probabilities are |c1|^2, |c2|^2, |c3|^2.

Calculating each:

|c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
|c3|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, its square would have diagonal elements as the squares of the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues squared are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the squares:

(1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the components of $|\psi\rangle$ correspond to the amplitudes of the eigenstates of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are the diagonal elements of its matrix: $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The probabilities for each eigenstate are the squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of $P_z$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$: $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Using the same probabilities as above, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
