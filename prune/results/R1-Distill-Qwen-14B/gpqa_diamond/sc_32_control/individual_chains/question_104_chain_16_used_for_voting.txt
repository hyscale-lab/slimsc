Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. When a planet is orbiting a star, the star itself moves in a small orbit, and this causes the spectral lines to shift periodically. The shift relates to the mass and orbit of the planet.

The question says that two stars have the same mass as each other and similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (V) which is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination. Oh right, the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) 

Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude. Let me recall: 

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But I'm not sure about the exact constants. Alternatively, maybe there's a scaling relation between the two planets because the stars are identical and the planets have the same mass and the same sin i (assuming same inclination, which I think the problem implies since it's about the same setup).

Wait, the problem states both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and the stars have masses similar to the Sun. So M_p1 = M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2. 

The RV shift is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

So the ratio of K2 to K1 would be (since M_p and M_star are the same):

K2/K1 = ( (1 / P2^(1/3)) ) / (1 / P1^(1/3)) ) ) 

So K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, rearranging, because K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 would be smaller, because K is inversely related to P^0.333.

Wait, in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1.

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4 

Then from K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So 1.4 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides: 1.4^3 = (P1 / P2 )

1.4^3 is approximately 2.744.

Wait, 1.4 * 1.4 is 1.96, times 1.4 again is about 2.744. So (P1/P2) = 2.744.

So P2 = P1 / 2.744.

We need the ratio of P2 to P1. So P2/P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3648.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer planet #2's period is than planet #1's. So since 0.36 < 1, it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times longer, but wait, wait, that's not right. Because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of #2 is 0.36 times that of #1, meaning it's shorter, not longer.

Wait, but the question says "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

If P2 is shorter, the factor would be less than 1. Oh, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, etc. So the factor is 0.36. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, let me double-check. So the formula is K proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))) ). Since M_p and M_star are same for both, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K2 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3) * K1.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let me write it properly.

K1 = (constant) * (M_p1) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P1)^(1/3) )

Similarly for K2.

Since M_p1 = M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, the constants are same, so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) 

Wait, wait, no: K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = K0 * (1/P1^(1/3)), and K2 = K0 * (1/P2^(1/3)).

So K2/K1 = [1/P2^(1/3)] / [1/P1^(1/3)] ] = (P1/P2)^(1/3) 

Since K2=7 and K1=5, K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. So 1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). 

So (P1/P2) = (1.4)^3 ≈ 2.744. So P1 = 2.744 * P2.

Which implies P2 = P1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3648 * P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, which is shorter. Wait, but the question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, so the period of P2 is 0.36 times the period of P1. So the answer is about 0.36 times longer, meaning it's shorter, but the question is asking how many times longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, so option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me check again.

We have K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) * K1.

Wait, no:

Another approach: since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So if K2 = 7 and K1=5, then P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Because P is proportional to 1/K^3. So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Calculate (5/7)^3.

5^3 = 125, 7^3=343. 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's shorter.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2's period than P1's? So P2 is longer by a factor of 0.36, meaning it's shorter. So the factor is less than 1. Hence, the correct answer is option A) ~0.36.

The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) of the RV signal is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given that the mass of the planet \( M_p \), the mass of the star \( M_{\text{star}} \), and the inclination angle \( i \) are constant. Mathematically, \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \).

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, the RV shifts are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), respectively. Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2 \) and \( P_1 \) can be determined using:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( K_2 = 7 \) and \( K_1 = 5 \):

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{343}{125} \approx 2.744.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \approx 2.744 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx \frac{1}{2.744} \approx 0.364.
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is **shorter** than that of Planet #1 by a factor of approximately 0.36.

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \), the factor is less than 1, and the answer is approximately 0.36.
