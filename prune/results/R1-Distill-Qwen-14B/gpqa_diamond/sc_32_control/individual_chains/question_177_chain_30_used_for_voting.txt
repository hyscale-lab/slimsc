Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that luminosity is related to a star's properties, so I need to think about the formulas involved. The question gives me some data: the radius and mass of Star_1 are both 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. Wait, but wait—luminosity is more directly tied to radius and temperature, right? Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σT⁴. So mass might not come into play here unless it's affecting the temperature somehow. But the problem says they're treated as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't directly needed beyond what's given about radius and temperature.

The problem also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's the peak wavelength in their blackbody spectrum. Remember Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait a second. Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength, so same T. So their temperatures are the same. So that's an important point. Now, what's the question? The question is about the ratio of their luminosities.

So, L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴. But T is same for both. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But T1 = T2, so (T1/T2) is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. 

Wait, but the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. Then (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Hmm, but wait, the options have some numbers around 2.23 to 2.35. Option A is 2.25, D is 2.23, B is 2.32, C is 2.35. So why is none of the options exactly 2.25? Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh right, the radial velocity is given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, but how does that affect luminosity? Wait, maybe that's a red herring. Because radial velocity affects the observed brightness through Doppler shift, but the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming black bodies. So perhaps the radial velocity is about the spectral lines' shifts, but the brightness is measured in the rest frame.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So in the observed frame, but when calculating luminosity, we probably need to account for any Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted, which affects where the peak is. So for example, if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so the observed peak would be at a shorter wavelength than the rest frame. Conversely, if it recedes, it's redshifted.

Wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is the same. So if one star is moving, say, towards us, and another is moving away, their observed T would change because of the Doppler effect. So perhaps I need to adjust their temperatures based on their velocities.

Let me think this through. The actual temperature of the star is T_rest, but when the star is moving towards us, the observed temperature would be higher because of blueshift. Similarly, moving away would lower the observed temperature. So the observed temperature is T_observed = T_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, actually, the Doppler effect formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive for moving away. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to T, T_observed = T_rest / (1 + v_r / c). 

Wait, let's correct that. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And for radial velocity v (v<<c), z ≈ v_r / c. So λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c). Since λ_max is proportional to 1/T, then T_obs ≈ T_rest / (1 + v_r / c). 

But in the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. Let's denote λ1_obs = λ1_rest * (1 + v1_r / c), and λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c). Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, we have λ1_rest (1 + v1_r / c) = λ2_rest (1 + v2_r / c). 

But wait, from the problem, the stars' rest temperature would be related to their radius and their rest luminosity. Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the observed temperature. 

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So for each star, the observed λ_max is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. 

But each star's λ_obs is based on their rest frame λ_rest and their velocity. 

Let me denote their rest wavelengths as λ1_rest and λ2_rest. Then:

λ_obs1 = λ1_rest * (1 + v1_r / c)
λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c)

And since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have:

λ1_rest * (1 + v1_r / c) = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c)

We also know that from Wien's law, λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_rest = b / T1
λ2_rest = b / T2

So substituting:

(b / T1) * (1 + v1_r / c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r / c)

Canceling b:

(1 / T1) * (1 + v1_r / c) = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2_r / c)

Rearranging:

T2 / T1 = (1 + v2_r / c) / (1 + v1_r / c)

But wait, the problem states that Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, the radial velocity given is 0 and 700 km/s. But wait, are these velocities towards or away from us? Because the sign matters. Let's assume that radial velocity is positive when moving away. So Star_1's v_r is 0, Star_2's is 700 km/s (so moving away). 

So substituting the values:

v1_r = 0 km/s, v2_r = 700 km/s.

So plug into the equation:

T2 / T1 = (1 + (700 / c)) / (1 + 0) 

Because v1_r is 0, so denominator is 1, numerator is 1 + 700/c.

But 700 km/s is much less than c (approx 3e5 km/s), so 700/c is about 0.002333.

So approximately, 1 + 700/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 / T1 ≈ 1.002333.

Which implies T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, but wait. Because T_obs = T_rest / (1 + v_r / c). So for Star_2, moving away, its observed temperature is lower than its rest temperature. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. 

Each star's observed λ_max is the same. Let's call this common λ_max = λ0.

For Star_1 (v_r = 0):

λ0 = λ1_rest * (1 + 0) → λ1_rest = λ0.

For Star_2 (v_r = 700 km/s moving away):

λ0 = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/c )

So λ2_rest = λ0 / (1 + 700/c )

But λ_rest is related to temperature via Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T_rest.

So,

λ1_rest = b / T1
λ2_rest = b / T2

Substituting into the above:

b / T1 = λ0 → T1 = b / λ0.

And,

b / T2 = λ0 / (1 + 700/c) → T2 = (b * (1 + 700/c )) / λ0

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/c )

Because T1 = b/λ0,

So,

T2 = (b/λ0) * (1 + 700/c ) = T1 (1 + 700/c )

So T2 is higher than T1 because Star_2 is moving away (so its observed λ_max is longer than it would be at rest, implying a lower temperature, but wait this is confusing me. Wait, no: observed λ_max is longer because it's moving away, so T_obs is lower than T_rest.

Wait, maybe I got it backwards. Let me think again.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is longer than λ_rest if the star is moving away (redshifted), which means the observed temperature T_obs is lower than T_rest because λ is inversely proportional to T.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, λ0.

So for Star_1, which is not moving, λ1_rest = λ0.

For Star_2, which is moving away, λ2_rest * (1 + v_r/c) = λ0. So λ2_rest = λ0 / (1 + v_r/c )

But λ_rest is related to T_rest via λ_rest = b / T_rest → T_rest = b / λ_rest.

So,

T1_rest = b / λ0.

T2_rest = b / (λ0 / (1 + v_r/c )) ) = (b (1 + v_r/c )) / λ0 = T1_rest (1 + v_r/c )

Wait, but that would mean T2_rest is higher than T1_rest. Because (1 + v_r/c) is about 1.002333. So T2_rest ≈ 1.002333 * T1_rest.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, which would mean a lower observed temperature. But its rest temperature is higher? That makes sense because when a star moves away, its light is redshifted, so the observed temperature is lower than its rest temperature. But the rest temperature is higher than what's observed.

So, the rest temperatures are T1 and T2, with T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c )

But for calculating luminosity, we use the rest temperature, because luminosity is an intrinsic property, not the observed one. Because when we compute L using the blackbody formula, we use the star's actual temperature, not the observed one.

Wait no. Wait, no, the problem says that the luminosity is computed based on the star's observed properties. Because the question is about what the astronomers compute, which would be based on their observations, including any Doppler shifts.

Wait, the problem says: "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

But according to the problem statement, the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation.

So, when they compute the luminosity, they would use the observed parameters, not the rest frame parameters. Because they are using the observed wavelengths. So perhaps when they compute the luminosity, they use the observed temperature—so T_obs.

Wait, but the luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it's the same regardless of the observer's frame. But when you observe a star moving, the observed flux is affected by Doppler shift, but the intrinsic luminosity is based on the star's rest parameters.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express this.

The intrinsic luminosity (L) of a star is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So this is in the star's rest frame.

But when we observe the star, due to Doppler shift, the observed flux is affected. But the question says they computed the luminosity using the blackbody assumption. So perhaps they calculate L based on the observed parameters, which are affected by Doppler.

Alternatively, perhaps they have corrected for the Doppler shift to find the intrinsic parameters.

Wait, the problem states:

"Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively."

So, they know the velocities. So when computing the luminosity, they would presumably correct for the Doppler shift to find the intrinsic T and R, then compute L.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the observed flux is affected by Doppler, but the astronomers know the velocities and can correct for them to find the intrinsic luminosity.

But wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. So perhaps they used the observed flux and observed size, and observed temperature to compute L, but that would be wrong. Or maybe they used the actual R and intrinsic T, but to get intrinsic T, they have to correct for the Doppler shift.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to reapproach the problem.

Given:

1. R1 = 1.5 R2.

2. M1 = 1.5 M2, but for luminosity, mass isn't directly relevant unless via other relations, but we can ignore it since luminosity depends on R and T.

3. The observed λ_max (where they appear brightest) is the same for both stars. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ0.

4. Radial velocities: Star_1 has v_r = 0, Star_2 has v_r = +700 km/s (assuming positive is moving away).

We need to find the ratio L1/L2.

But L is based on R and T in the rest frame of the star.

So, to find L1 and L2, we need the rest R and rest T of each star.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

We need T1 and T2 in their rest frames.

But how?

We can relate the observed λ_max to the rest λ_max via Doppler shift.

For Star_1: v_r1 = 0, so observed λ_max1 = rest λ_max1. So λ0 = λ_rest1 → λ_rest1 = λ0.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c) → λ0 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 700/c )

So, λ_rest2 = λ0 / (1 + 700/c )

Since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T_rest (Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T_rest ), we have:

λ_rest1 = b / T1_rest → T1_rest = b / λ_rest1 = b/λ0.

Similarly, λ_rest2 = b / T2_rest → T2_rest = b / λ_rest2 = b * (1 + 700/c ) / λ0.

So,

T2_rest = T1_rest * (1 + 700/c )

Because T1_rest is b/λ0, and T2_rest is (b (1 + 700/c )) / λ0.

Thus, T2_rest = T1_rest * (1 + delta), where delta is 700/c ≈ 0.002333.

So, T2_rest ≈ T1_rest * 1.002333.

Now, let's compute L1 and L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1_rest^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2_rest^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = (2.25) R2².

T2_rest = T1_rest * 1.002333 → T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2^4 = (T1^4) * (1.002333)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 / ( R2² * (T1^4 * (1.002333)^4) ) )

Simplify:

= 2.25 / (1.002333)^4

Now, let's compute (1.002333)^4. Let's approximate.

First, 1.002333 is approximately 1.00233.

We can calculate (1.00233)^4.

Let me compute it step by step.

(1.00233)^2 = 1.00233 * 1.00233 ≈ 1.00466.

Then, (1.00466)^2 ≈ 1.00933.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, using the approximation (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² for small x.

x = 0.002333.

n=4.

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3)/2 * (0.002333)^2 → 1 + 0.009332 + (6)*(~0.00000544) → 0.009332 + 0.00003264 → ~1.00936464.

So, 1.009365 approximately.

So, L1/L2 ratio is 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ let's compute this.

2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009365.

1.009365 is about 1.009365 ≈ 1.00936.

So 2.25 / 1.00936 → let's compute.

2.25 ÷ 1.00936.

Let me compute:

1.00936 × 2.228 ≈ 2.25 ?

Wait, 1.00936 × 2.228 = ?

Let me compute 1.00936 × 2 = 2.01872.

1.00936 × 0.228 = ?

0.228 * 1 =0.228

0.228 *0.00936 ≈ 0.00213.

So total ≈ 0.228 + 0.00213 ≈ 0.23013.

So 2.01872 + 0.23013 = 2.24885, which is about 2.25.

So, 1.00936 × 2.228 ≈ 2.24885, which is very close to 2.25. So 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ approximately 2.228.

So the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.228.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.228 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1^2 = (1.5)^2 R_2^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \).
2. **Observed Peak Wavelengths**: Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), implying their observed temperatures are the same. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = b / T_{\text{obs}} \), we conclude \( T_{\text{obs,1}} = T_{\text{obs,2}} \).
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has \( v_{r,1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), and Star_2 has \( v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (moving away). The Doppler shift affects the observed temperature:
   \[
   T_{\text{obs}} = \frac{T_{\text{rest}}}{1 + v_r / c}
   \]
   For Star_2, the rest temperature is higher than its observed temperature due to redshift.

### Step 1: Relating Rest Temperatures
Using the Doppler shift formula:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r / c)
\]
For Star_1 (\( v_{r,1} = 0 \)):
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}
\]
For Star_2 (\( v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + 700 / c)
\]
Equating the observed wavelengths:
\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + 700 / c)
\]
Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T_{\text{rest}} \), we find:
\[
T_{\text{rest,2}} = T_{\text{rest,1}} \cdot (1 + 700 / c)
\]
Substituting \( v_r / c \approx 0.002333 \):
\[
T_{\text{rest,2}} \approx T_{\text{rest,1}} \cdot 1.002333
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_{\text{rest,1}}^4}{R_2^2 T_{\text{rest,2}}^4}
\]
Substituting \( R_1^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \) and \( T_{\text{rest,2}} = T_{\text{rest,1}} \cdot 1.002333 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25 R_2^2 T_{\text{rest,1}}^4}{R_2^2 T_{\text{rest,1}}^4 (1.002333)^4}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4}
\]
Using the approximation \( (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00936 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.00936} \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the luminosities is approximately **2.23**, which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
