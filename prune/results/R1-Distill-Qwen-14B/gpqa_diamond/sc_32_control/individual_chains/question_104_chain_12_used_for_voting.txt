Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the only differences are the spectral line shifts.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, radial velocity shift is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, right? Or does it relate to the semi-major axis?

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = (2πG)^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^{2/3} * (P)^{1/3} ) ) ) ). But wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so M_p is negligible. So K is proportional to M_p / (M_star^{2/3} * P^{1/3} )^{1/}.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (2π)) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c))

But since e is zero (circular orbit) and M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies. So approximately, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c), but c is a constant and same for both, so when comparing K for the two planets, the ratio K1/K2 would be ( (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2/P1) )^(1/3) ) ?

Wait, no, let me re-express it correctly. Let's write the formula for K for each planet.

K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, maximum effect), and M_p for both planets is similar to Neptune. Since the planets have similar masses, M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So for the two planets, the ratio of their K values is K1/K2 ≈ (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_p1 sin i1) ) * [ M_star1^(2/3) / M_star2^(2/3) ) ]

But M_star1 = M_star2 = Sun's mass, so that cancels out. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (M_p2 / M_p1). But M_p1 ≈ M_p2, so that ratio is approximately (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, but wait, in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), so K1 = (M_p1) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ), same for K2. So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (M_star2/M_star1)^(2/3) )

But since M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, the ratio simplifies to K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. Let me write each K.

K1 = (M_p1) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

K2 = (M_p2) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Given that M_p1 ≈ M_p2, which is Neptune mass, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So K1/K2 ≈ (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

But in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of orbital periods. Let me think: the ratio K1/K2 is 5/7, so from above, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Taking both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1

Wait no, wait: K1/K2 = [ (P2/P1)^(1/3) ) ] * [ (M_p1/M_p2) ]

Since M_p1 ≈ M_p2, K1/K2 ≈ (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait no, because K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 = 5/7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the formula is K ∝ (M_p) / (P^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

But M_p1 ≈ M_p2, so K1/K2 ≈ (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

Which is (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

We're given K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Thus, (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Calculating (5/7)^3: 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

Which means P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question asks: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So P2 is 0.364 * P1, which is shorter. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1, so the answer would be 0.364 times longer, which is 0.36 approx. But wait, wait: no, the question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1".

Wait, if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's actually shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter, not longer. So the question is, what is the ratio P2/P1? If the ratio is 0.36, that would mean planet #2's period is 0.36 times planet #1's period, i.e., shorter. So planet #1 has a longer period.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's. So if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So the ratio would be less than 1, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (1 / (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Assuming sin i =1 and M_p is same for both, then K is inversely proportional to (P^(1/3)).

So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3))

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, no, because if K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 ), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3 ), K2 = C / P2^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Which is the same conclusion as before.

So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 ≈ (0.714)^3 * P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is 0.364 of P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1? No, that can't be. Because 0.36 times is shorter.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio reversed. Let me think: if K is higher, does that imply a longer period?

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), so K1=5 < K2=7. So 5 <7 → 5/7=0.714 <1.

If K is inversely related to P^(1/3 ), then higher K → smaller P.

So planet #2 has a higher K, which implies a shorter orbital period.

So P2 < P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. That is, if P2 is longer, then the ratio is greater than 1. But in this case, it's less than 1, so P2 is shorter.

But the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the period is shorter. But the question is about how many times longer, which would be a number less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the inverse. Because the question is about P2 being longer than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then the ratio is 0.36, so P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So the period is not longer; it's shorter. So the correct answer would be that P2 is 0.36 times the period of P1, so it's 0.36 times as long, so P2's period is shorter than P1's, and thus it's not longer. But the options don't have an option about being shorter; the question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1?"

So the answer would be 0.36 times as long, which is option A. But since the question is asking how many times longer, so if it's 0.36 times longer, that implies it's shorter. So the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

Since the masses of the planets (\( M_p \)) and the stars (\( M_{\text{star}} \)) are the same for both systems, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). Thus, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of the orbital periods as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **0.36 times**, which corresponds to option A.
