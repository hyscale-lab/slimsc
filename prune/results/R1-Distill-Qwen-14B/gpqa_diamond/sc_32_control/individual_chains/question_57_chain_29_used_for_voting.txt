Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering experiments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have measured phase shifts for an elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're supposed to ignore the rest, so I guess that's all we need to consider.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the scattering amplitude in nuclear physics often relates to the optical theorem or partial waves expansion. I remember that the scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the partial waves, each with a phase shift.

Wait, the general form is f(θ, φ) = sum over l [ (2l + 1) / (2k) ] * [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} } ] where P_l are Legendre polynomials, k is the wave number, and δ_l are the phase shifts.

But since the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction, I think that's when θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam would be along the initial direction, which is θ=0. Also, φ would be 0 because the scattering is along the beam direction. So φ=0.

Wait, no, wait. When you have a scattering angle θ, the initial beam direction is along θ=0, but for the scattering amplitude, the direction could be any. But in this case, the question specifies "along the incident beam direction," which might imply θ=0. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the direction of the beam as the initial direction, so maybe that's the forward direction. Hmm. Or wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the form of the scattering amplitude.

The optical theorem says that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is related to the total cross-section. The formula is Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total.

Wait, but in this problem, maybe I don't need to go that route because I have the phase shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part along the beam (θ=0) can be found by considering the partial wave expansion, and evaluating each term at θ=0, then summing the imaginary parts.

So, let's break it down. The scattering amplitude f is the sum over l of [ (2l + 1)/(2k) ] * (e^{i δ_l} - 1) * P_l (cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

At θ=0, cosθ=1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l. And at φ=0, e^{i l φ} is 1. So each term simplifies to [ (2l + 1)/(2k) ] * (e^{i δ_l} - 1).

So f(0) is the sum from l=0 to 4 (since we have phase shifts up to δ4) of [ (2l +1)/(2k) ] * (e^{i δ_l} - 1).

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

So Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2l +1)/(2k) * Im( e^{i δ_l} - 1 ) ]

But e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So e^{i δ_l} -1 = (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l. So the imaginary part is sin δ_l.

Therefore, Im(f(0)) = sum [ (2l +1)/(2k) * sin δ_l ] for l=0 to 4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the overall factor is (2l+1)/(2k). So the imaginary part would be the sum of (2l + 1)/(2k) multiplied by sin δ_l.

So I need to calculate each term for l=0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Given that:

- For l=0: (2*0+1)/(2k) * sin(δ₀)
- l=1: (3)/(2k) * sin(67°)
- l=2: 5/(2k) * sin(55°)
- l=3:7/(2k) * sin(30°)
- l=4:9/(2k) * sin(13°)

But wait, what is k here? k is the wave number, which for electrons is given by k = (sqrt(2mE))/ħ. Wait, wait, let's compute that.

The incident electrons have energy E=50 MeV. Let me make sure of the units. The mass m of an electron is about 0.511 MeV/c². So E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m c², so we can use relativistic expressions.

The relativistic expression for the wave number k is given by k = (sqrt(2 m E)) / ħ. Wait, no, wait. The non-relativistic formula is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but when E is much larger than m c², maybe the relativistic formula is more appropriate. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the approximation that E ≈ pc for high energies. Because for high-energy electrons, E ≈ pc, so p = E/(c). Then, since k = p/ħ, so k = (E/(c)) / ħ.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The correct relativistic expression for the momentum p is p = gamma m v. But perhaps for high energies, we can relate E and p via E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. For E >> mc², this simplifies to E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c).

So, the wave number k is p/ħ. So, k = (E/(c)) ) / ħ.

But let's compute it properly. Let's write E in units of MeV, ħ in units of MeV·fm (since 1 MeV·fm is a convenient unit for nuclear physics). So, ħ c is about 197.3 MeV·fm (I remember that ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm).

Wait, wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Since 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV, so ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-28 MeV·s.

But when we compute k = p / ħ, and p = E/c (for high E), then:

k = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c).

So, ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm, as I thought earlier.

So, E is 50 MeV, so k = 50 / (197.3) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹. Let me compute it more precisely: 50 / 197.3 = approximately 0.2533.

So, k ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Now, let's compute each term:

For each l, calculate (2l+1)/(2k) * sin δ_l.

Compute each l:

l=0:
(1)/(2k) * sin(90°)
sin(90)=1.
So term = 1/(2*0.2533) *1 ≈ (1)/(0.5066) ≈ 1.974 fm.

l=1:
(3)/(2k) * sin(67°)
sin(67) ≈ 0.9205
Term = 3/(2*0.2533) * 0.9205 ≈ (3/0.5066) * 0.9205 ≈ (5.92) * 0.9205 ≈ 5.456 fm.

l=2:
5/(2k) * sin(55°)
sin(55) ≈ 0.8192
Term = 5/(0.5066) * 0.8192 ≈ (9.87) * 0.8192 ≈ 8.09 fm.

l=3:
7/(2k) * sin(30)
sin(30) = 0.5
Term =7/(0.5066) * 0.5 ≈ 13.81 * 0.5 ≈6.905 fm.

l=4:
9/(2k) * sin(13)
sin(13) ≈ 0.22495
Term =9/(0.5066) * 0.22495 ≈ 17.76 * 0.22495 ≈4.01 fm.

Now sum all these terms:

l=0: 1.974
l=1:5.456 → sum so far 7.43
l=2:8.09 → sum 15.52
l=3:6.905 → sum 22.425
l=4:4.01 → sum 26.435 fm.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are way larger than that, like several hundred. Hmm, did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, let's re-examine the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating k.

Ah, wait a second. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me re-express everything.

Hmm, the confusion is between units. Let's make sure all units are correctly handled.

Electron energy E = 50 MeV.

The momentum p can be found from relativistic energy: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².

But since the electron mass mc² is 0.511 MeV, and E=50 MeV is much larger, we can approximate p ≈ E/c.

Wait, but let's compute it exactly. Let me compute p:

E² = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2.

So,

pc = sqrt(E² - (0.511)^2) ≈ sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV.

So, p = (49.997 MeV) / c.

Now, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ.

But ħ in MeV·fm units: Let's recall that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (ħ c) / c → but I think it's easier to compute k in terms of MeV and c.

Wait, let me think: 

k = p / ħ = (E/(c)) / (ħ) → but wait, in terms of units, perhaps I should express everything in terms of MeV, c, and ħ.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1, ħ=1. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: in natural units (ħ=1, c=1), the wave number k is p/E * E (since p = E for massless particles, but electrons are not massless. Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute k in units of fm⁻¹.

We have p = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / c^2.

Wait, no, wait, the correct way is:

k = p / ħ = ( [ (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )^(1/2) ] / c ) / ħ.

So, in terms of MeV:

E = 50 MeV.

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = (50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50^2 (since 0.511^2 is negligible) ≈ 2500 (MeV)^2.

So, p = sqrt(2500) MeV / c → p =50 MeV/c.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

Now, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Which is 6.582 × 10^-25 MeV·s × 1e9 (since 1 GeV=1e3 MeV). Wait, no, GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 1 GeV=1e3 MeV.

Wait, ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s = 6.582 × 10^-25 * 1e3 MeV·s → 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

But I think I'm getting confused with units. Let me think in terms of ħ c. Since ħ c ≈ 197.327 MeV·fm.

So, ħ c = 197.327 MeV·fm.

So, k = p/(ħ) → p = (50 MeV/c) → so k = (50 MeV/c ) / ħ.

But since ħ c = 197.327 MeV·fm, then 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.327 MeV·fm) ) = (1/(197.327 MeV)) ) * 1 fm⁻¹.

So, k = (50 MeV/c ) / (ħ) = (50 MeV ) * (1/(ħ c)) ) * (1/c).

Wait, perhaps an alternative way: let's compute k as (E)/(ħ c), since for E >> m c^2, p ≈ E/c, and k = p/ħ.

So, k ≈ E/(ħ c) → E in MeV, and ħ c is 197.327 MeV·fm.

So, k = 50 MeV / (197.327 MeV·fm) ) = 50 / 197.327 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Wait, same as before. So I think my earlier calculation of k was correct, about 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

But wait, in the terms I computed earlier, the sum came out to about 26.435 fm. But the options are 355, 177, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin δ_l. But wait, that's in terms of units. Because the scattering amplitude f has units of fm (since cross-section is in barns, which is fm², and f is dimensionless in terms of cross-section, but actually, in terms of scattering amplitude in nuclear physics, f is in fm).

Wait, wait, the cross-section σ is |f|^2 multiplied by 4π/k², but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Let me think again about the units.

Wait, in the formula for the scattering amplitude, the terms are [ (2l+1)/(2k) ] * (e^{i δ_l} -1) * P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

So each term has units of [1/(fm)] * [dimensionless] because P_l is dimensionless. So the entire amplitude f has units of 1/fm, or inverse femtometers.

Now, when I compute Im(f(0)), each term in the sum is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin δ_l → (1/(fm)) ) * (dimensionless) → 1/fm.

Wait, but the options are in fm, so perhaps I've missed a factor somewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should be calculating the sum in terms of the optical theorem, which relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The optical theorem states that Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total.

But wait, the question isn't giving the total cross-section. So maybe I'm supposed to compute the sum as I did before, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the sum:

Each term: (2l+1)/(2k) * sin δ_l.

k = 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, for l=0: (1)/(2 * 0.2533) * sin(90) → 1/(0.5066) * 1 → ~1.974 fm.

Wait, no! Wait, (2l+1)/(2k) → 1/(2k) → 1/(2 * 0.2533) → 1/0.5066 ≈ 1.974 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but the units would be (1/fm⁻¹) → fm. So each term is in fm.

Wait, but the sum I did earlier gave about 26.435 fm. But the options are much larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong expression for k.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for the phase shift expansion is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ (e^{2 i δ_l} -1 )/(2 k) ) ] P_l (cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me confirm the formula.

Wait, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1 )/(2k) ) ] P_l (cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

Wait, that would change things because earlier I thought it's (e^{i δ_l} -1 ), but perhaps it's (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ), so the factor is different.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me check.

The standard expression is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{2 i δ_l} -1 ) ] [ P_l (cosθ) e^{i l φ} ].

So, the term is (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ), so the expression is (e^{2i δ} -1 ) = e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} - e^{-iδ}) ) = e^{iδ} (2i sin δ )

So, (e^{2iδ} -1 ) = 2i e^{iδ} sin δ.

Wait, so the imaginary part of f(0) would be Im [ sum (2l+1)/(2k) (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) P_l(1) e^{i l 0} } ]

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1. φ=0 → e^{i l 0}=1.

So, Im(f(0)) = Im [ sum (2l+1)/(2k) (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ]

Since e^{2i δ_l} -1 = 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l,

So, (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) = 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Thus, each term in the sum becomes (2l+1)/(2k) * 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of this term is: (2l+1)/(2k) * 2 sin δ_l sin δ_l.

Wait, because the term is (2l+1)/(2k) * 2i e^{i δ} sin δ.

Wait, let me compute the imaginary part of each term.

Each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * (e^{2i δ_l} -1 )

Which is (2l+1)/(2k) * (cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1 )

Which equals (2l+1)/(2k) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sin(2δ_l) ) ]

So, the imaginary part is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l).

Wait, that changes everything. So Im(f(0)) is the sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2 δ_l).

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier by using sin δ_l instead of sin(2 δ_l). That's where I went wrong.

So let me recalculate using sin(2 δ_l).

So for each l:

l=0: δ0=90° → 2δ0=180°, sin(180)=0 → term is zero.

l=1: δ=67 → 2δ=134°, sin(134)= sin(180-46)= sin(46)= ~0.7193 → term = (3)/(2k) * 0.7193.

l=2: δ=55 → 2δ=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)= ~0.9397 → term= (5)/(2k) *0.9397.

l=3: δ=30 → 2δ=60 → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. Term=7/(2k)*0.8660.

l=4: δ=13 → 2δ=26°, sin(26)= ~0.4384 → term=9/(2k)*0.4384.

So now, let's compute each term with k=50 MeV / (197.327 MeV·fm) ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Compute each term:

k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

l=1 term:
(3) / (2 * 0.2533) * 0.7193 → 3/(0.5066) * 0.7193 ≈ 5.915 * 0.7193 ≈ 4.266 fm.

l=2 term:
5/(2k) *0.9397 → (5/0.5066) *0.9397 ≈ 9.871 *0.9397 ≈9.268 fm.

l=3 term:
7/(2k)*0.8660 → (7/0.5066)*0.8660≈13.81 *0.8660 ≈12.00 fm.

l=4 term:
9/(2k) *0.4384 → (9/0.5066) *0.4384 ≈17.76 *0.4384≈7.78 fm.

l=0 term is zero.

Now sum all terms: 4.266 +9.268=13.534; 13.534 +12.00=25.534; 25.534+7.78=33.314 fm.

Wait, that's about 33.3 fm. But the options are around 177, 251, etc.

Hmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the formula is (2l+1)/(2k) times sin(2 delta_l) * 2. Because when I did the earlier expansion, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, let me re-express the imaginary part.

So, the f(0) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2i delta_l} -1 ) P_l(1) e^{i l 0}.

That simplifies to (1/k) sum (2l+1) (e^{2i delta_l} -1 ).

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) Im( e^{2i delta_l} -1 ) → since Im(e^{iθ} )= sin θ, so Im(e^{2i delta} -1 )= Im(e^{2i delta} )= sin(2 delta).

So, Im(f(0))= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l).

Ah, wait a second. I think earlier, I used (2l+1)/(2k) instead of (2l+1)/k. Because in the expression for f, each term is (2l+1) [ (e^{2i delta} -1 )/(2k) ) ].

Wait, so f(0)= sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2i delta_l} -1 )/(2k) ) ] *1.

So Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) [ Im( e^{2i delta_l} -1 ) ]/(2k) ]

Which is sum (2l+1) [ sin(2 delta_l) ]/(2k).

Ah! So I had a factor of 1/(2k) instead of 1/k earlier. So I think I should go back.

So, the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2 delta_l).

Wait, that's the same as before, but in my first approach, I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recalculate with the correct approach.

So, each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2 delta_l).

k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

l=1: 3/(2k) * sin(134) → 3/(2*0.2533) * sin(134) → 3/(0.5066) * sin(134)=5.915 * 0.670 → wait, wait, wait, no, sin(134 degrees) is sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193. So 5.915 *0.7193≈4.266 fm.

l=2:5/(2k) * sin(110)=5/(0.5066) *0.9397≈9.871 *0.9397≈9.268 fm.

l=3:7/(2k)* sin(60)=7/(0.5066) *0.8660≈13.81 *0.8660≈12.00 fm.

l=4:9/(2k)* sin(26)=9/(0.5066) *0.4384≈17.76 *0.4384≈7.78 fm.

Summing these: 4.266 +9.268 =13.534; +12 →25.534; +7.78→33.314 fm.

Hmm, but this is still around 33.3 fm, but the options are way larger. So maybe I missed a factor somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units for k. Let me double-check.

I might have messed up the calculation of k. Let me compute k again more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

m c² =0.511 MeV → E much larger, so p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

Wait, but when you compute p = 50 MeV/c, then k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) )= (50 /197.33) (MeV/c) * (c/(MeV·fm)) ) → the c cancels, and you're left with (50/197.33) 1/fm → 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, k=0.2533 fm⁻¹. That part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula I'm using is for the scattering amplitude in units of inverse fermis, but the options are in femtometers. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of (2π) or something else.

Wait, another thought: The formula I'm using gives Im(f(0)) in units of fm (because 1/k is in fm). But the cross section is σ_total = 4π/k^2 * |f|^2. But I'm not calculating the cross-section here; I'm calculating the imaginary part of the amplitude.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps my calculation is off by a factor of 2. Let me recheck the terms again.

Wait, let me recalculate each term with more precise numbers.

Compute each term with l=1,2,3,4:

l=1: (3)/(2 * 0.2533) * sin(134) 

3/(2*0.2533) = 3/(0.5066) ≈5.915.

sin(134 degrees)= sin(46)≈0.7193.

So term=5.915 *0.7193≈4.27 fm.

l=2:5/(2*0.2533)=5/0.5066≈9.871.

sin(110)= sin(70)=0.9397.

Term=9.871 *0.9397≈9.268 fm.

l=3:7/(2*0.2533)=7/0.5066≈13.81.

sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

Term=13.81 *0.8660≈12.00 fm.

l=4:9/(2*0.2533)=9/0.5066≈17.76.

sin(26)=0.4384.

Term=17.76 *0.4384≈7.78 fm.

Sum:4.27 +9.268=13.538; +12=25.538; +7.78≈33.318 fm.

Hmm, still around 33.3 fm. But the options are much larger. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think: Did I forget to multiply by 2 in the formula?

Wait, the formula for f(0) is sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2i delta_l} -1 )/(2k) ) ].

So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) [ sin(2 delta_l) )/(2k) ].

But perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2 delta_l) * (2), because f is (1/k) times the sum, but perhaps I need to account for it correctly.

Wait, no, because the sum is Im(f(0))= sum [ (2l+1) * sin(2 delta_l) )/(2k) ].

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2k instead of dividing?

No, because the formula is f(0)= sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2i delta_l} -1 )/(2k) ) ].

So, Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1)/(2k) sin(2 delta_l).

Wait, but maybe I should use k in units of 1/fm, so 1/k is in fm.

So, the sum gives Im(f(0)) in fm.

But the options are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in a different way. Let me compute it using exact values.

Compute k:

k= (sqrt(2 m E )) / ħ.

Wait, but wait, the non-relativistic expression is k = (sqrt(2 m E )) / ħ. But for E=50 MeV, which is much larger than m c²=0.511 MeV, so non-relativistic is not appropriate. So perhaps I should use the relativistic expression.

Wait, relativistic energy: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

At high energy, E≈pc → p≈E/c.

So, k = p/ħ = (E/(c)) / ħ.

But, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, E/(ħ c) →50/197.33 ≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Now, with that, let's compute each term again:

l=1: (3)/(2k) * sin(134)=3/(2*0.2533) *0.7193 → 3/(0.5066)=5.915 → 5.915 *0.7193=4.266 fm.

l=2:5/(2k)=5/(0.5066)=9.871 → *0.9397=9.268 fm.

l=3:7/(2k)=13.81 → *0.8660=12.00 fm.

l=4:9/(2k)=17.76 → *0.4384=7.78 fm.

Sum: 4.266+9.268=13.534; +12=25.534; +7.78=33.314 fm.

Hmm, that's about 33.3 fm, but the options are around 250, so I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees? Oh! Oh wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees: 90°, 67°, etc. But if I used them in radians, that would change everything.

Let me check: Did I convert degrees to radians when calculating sin?

Because in the calculation, I used sin(67 degrees), but if the phase shifts are in radians, then it would be a mistake.

Wait, no, the problem states the phase shifts are in degrees: δ₀=90°, so yes, they're given in degrees. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but let's try converting them to radians and see what happens.

Compute each term with δ in radians:

l=1: 2 δ=134 degrees → 134 * (pi/180) ≈2.34 radians.

sin(2.34)≈0.700.

So, term=5.915 *0.700≈4.14 fm.

l=2: 2 δ=110 degrees → 110*(pi/180)=1.919 radians. sin(1.919)=approx 0.944.

Term=9.871 *0.944≈9.34 fm.

l=3:2 δ=60 degrees=1.047 radians. sin(1.047)=√3/2≈0.866.

Term=13.81 *0.866≈12.00 fm.

l=4: 2 δ=26 degrees=0.454 radians. sin(0.454)=approx 0.440.

Term=17.76 *0.440≈7.81 fm.

Sum now is 4.14 +9.34=13.48; +12=25.48; +7.81→33.29 fm.

Still around 33.3 fm.

Hmm. Not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of 1/(2k), but perhaps the actual formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (2l +1)/(k) instead of (2l +1)/(2k) in the sum.

Let me try that. So, Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1)/(k) * sin(2 delta_l).

So, with k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

l=1:3/0.2533 * 0.7193 →≈11.85 *0.7193≈8.53 fm.

l=2:5/0.2533≈19.74 *0.9397≈18.53 fm.

l=3:7/0.2533≈27.63 *0.866≈23.94 fm.

l=4:9/0.2533≈35.52 *0.4384≈15.56 fm.

Sum:8.53 +18.53=27.06; +23.94=51.0; +15.56≈66.56 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are 177, 251, etc. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum without the 2 in the denominator. So Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) /k.

Wait, but that's what I just did, giving 66.56 fm.

Hmm... I'm stuck. Let me think about other approaches.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k, or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f can be related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total.

But the problem doesn't give the total cross-section, so perhaps that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are those for the partial waves, and the imaginary part is the sum of the contributions from each partial wave.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term as (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) and sum them, then multiply by (1/(2k)). Let me try that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier.

Wait, perhaps the formula is: Im(f(θ=0)) = sum ( (2l +1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

Wait, that would change the calculation.

So, for each l, term is (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k).

So let me compute each term:

k=0.2533 fm⁻¹.

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 → 1/(2*0.2533)=1/0.5066≈1.974 fm.

l=1:3 * sin(67) →3 *0.9205=2.7615 →2.7615/(2*0.2533)=2.7615/0.5066≈5.447 fm.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192=4.096 →4.096/(0.5066)=8.09 fm.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5 →3.5/(0.5066)=6.905 fm.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455 →2.02455/(0.5066)≈3.996 fm.

Sum:1.974+5.447=7.421; +8.09=15.511; +6.905=22.416; +3.996≈26.412 fm.

But this is still around 26.4 fm, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, but the options are 177.675, 355.351, etc., which are much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 or 100.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units, such as using k in the wrong unit.

Wait, let me compute k in inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers. Wait, but 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, so 1/fm is 1e15 m⁻¹.

Wait, no, wait. If k is 0.2533 fm⁻¹, that's 0.2533 / 1e-15 m⁻¹ = 2.533e14 m⁻¹. That seems way too large.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in units of 1e-15 m (fm). So, k=0.2533 fm⁻¹ = 0.2533 / (1e-15 m) ) → 2.533e14 m⁻¹.

But perhaps I should be using k in units of inverse meters when computing the terms.

Wait, maybe that's where I'm going wrong. Let me re-express everything.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses k in units of 1/fm, so when I compute (2l+1)/(2k), and k is in 1/fm, then the unit of each term is fm.

But in any case, the sum I've calculated, when using the correct formula, gives about 26.4 fm, but that's not an option. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the differential cross-section, but the question is about the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute something else, like the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude being the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part can be found using the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by a factor.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) in the forward direction is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l).

Earlier, I computed this sum to be approximately 33.3 fm. But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l).

In that case, with k=0.2533 fm⁻¹,

sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) = l=1:3 *0.7193=2.1579; l=2:5 *0.9397=4.6985; l=3:7 *0.866=6.062; l=4:9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579+4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.918; +3.9456=16.8636.

Multiply by 1/k= 1/0.2533≈3.95 fm.

So 16.8636 *3.95≈66.5 fm.

Which is still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are about 177, 251, etc.

Another thought: Perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Let me try that.

So, 90 degrees is π/2 radians. Let's compute sin(2 delta_l) for each l in radians.

Compute 2 delta in radians:

l=0: 180 degrees → pi radians → sin(pi)=0.

l=1: 134 degrees → 134 * pi/180 ≈2.340 radians. sin(2.340)= approx 0.700.

l=2: 110 degrees → 1.919 radians. sin=0.944.

l=3:60 degrees=1.047 radians. sin=0.866.

l=4:26 degrees=0.454 radians. sin≈0.440.

So the terms would be:

l=1: 3/(2k) *0.700 → 3/(2*0.2533)=5.915 →5.915 *0.700≈4.14 fm.

l=2:5/(2k)*0.944 →5/0.5066≈9.871 →9.871 *0.944≈9.34 fm.

l=3:7/(2k)*0.866 →7/0.5066≈13.81 →13.81 *0.866≈12.00 fm.

l=4:9/(2k)*0.440 →9/0.5066≈17.76 →17.76 *0.440≈7.81 fm.

Sum:4.14+9.34=13.48; +12=25.48; +7.81≈33.29 fm.

Still around 33.3 fm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the question says degrees. So that's not the issue.

Another approach: Perhaps the formula is different. For example, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude when considering spin states, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f=4π/(k) sum ( (2l+1) sin(delta_{l}) ) / (2k) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude is given by f(θ, φ) = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) (e^{2i delta_l} -1 ) P_lOkay, so I've got this question about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but I'll try to think this through.

From what I remember, the scattering amplitude in nuclear physics is often described using partial waves, each characterized by a phase shift δ_l. The amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over these partial waves. The formula I think is something like f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * sum [ ( (V_l - U_l) ) * sin(2δ_l) / cos(δ_l) ) ] or something along those lines. Wait, maybe I should get the exact expression right.

Wait, I'm mixing up terms. The scattering amplitude for each partial wave is f_l = (1/(k)) [ ( (U_l + V_l ) / (U_l - V_l) )^(1/2) ) - 1 ] e^{2iδ_l}, where k is the wave number. But the total scattering amplitude is the sum of all f_l multiplied by the spherical harmonics, but when considering the direction along the beam, that's the forward direction, so θ=0. So for the forward direction, the amplitude simplifies because the spherical harmonics terms might not matter much, or maybe each term contributes in a specific way.

Alternatively, maybe for the forward direction (θ=0), the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (1/(2ik)) * sum [ ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * (2l + 1) ). Hmm, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach comes to mind. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the sum over all the phase shifts. The formula I think is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l} ( ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} ) * sin(2δ_l) ). But I'm not very confident about this.

Wait, maybe I should recall the optical theorem. The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = (4π/ k² ) Im f(0). But since we're given the phase shifts, perhaps I can find Im f(0) from them.

Wait, the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( ( (2l+1) )/(2) ) * ( ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} ) * ( sin δ_l ) / ( cos δ_l ) ) * e^{2iδ_l} * P_l(cosθ), where P_l are Legendre polynomials. But when θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So f(0) would be the sum over l of ( (2l+1)/2 ) * ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} * ( sin(2 δ_l) ) ) * e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, e^{2i δ_l} can be written as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). But since we're interested in the imaginary part, let's focus on that. So the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum over l of ( (2l+1)/2 ) * ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} * sin(2δ_l) ).

But wait, I'm not sure about the (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) part. Because in the context of the scattering amplitude, the term (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) is under a square root. Alternatively, I remember that the (U_l + V_l) is the sum of the incoming and outgoing wave functions, and (U_l - V_l) is their difference. But wait, another approach: perhaps the scattering amplitude for each partial wave is f_l = (1/(k)) [ ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} - 1 ] e^{2i δ_l}.

But since I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact form, perhaps I should consider the simplest case. The question gives phase shifts δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. Other phase shifts are ignored.

Wait, but wait a second, the phase shifts are given for l=0,1,2,3,4. So each δ_l is for a particular orbital angular momentum quantum number l.

Now, the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is the sum of the contributions from each l. So for each l, the amplitude is something involving δ_l.

I remember that the imaginary part of f(0) is given by (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). Oh wait, but that would be the case if (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) is 1, which would imply that the phase shift is small, but that's perhaps not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the approximate expressions.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion. The total amplitude is the sum over l of f_l * (2l+1) P_l(cosθ). At θ=0, each P_l(1) is 1. So the total f(0) is the sum over l of f_l * (2l+1).

Each f_l is given by (1/(k)) [ ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} - 1 ] e^{2i δ_l}.

But wait, (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) = [ (e^{2i δ_l} ) ] ? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For each partial wave, the ratio (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) is equal to ( (e^{2i δ_l} ) ) as per the Born approximation, perhaps. Because when you have U and V being the regular and irregular solutions, their ratio leads to the phase shift.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. The phase shift δ_l is defined such that (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) = e^{2i δ_l}. So the square root of that ratio is e^{i δ_l}.

So then, ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} = e^{i δ_l}.

So then, f_l = (1/k) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expression for f_l is (1/k) [ sqrt( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) ) - 1 ] e^{2i δ_l}.

Ah, but since sqrt( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) ) is e^{i δ_l}, then f_l becomes (1/k) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) e^{2i δ_l} = (1/k) (e^{3i δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ).

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute the imaginary part of f(0). Since each f_l contributes a term (2l+1) f_l, and f(0) is the sum over f_l*(2l+1), then the imaginary part would involve the imaginary parts of each f_l multiplied by (2l+1).

So for each l, the contribution to Im f(0) is (2l+1) * Im [f_l].

Let me compute f_l for each l. Let's write f_l as (1/(k)) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, let me see: f_l = (1/k) [ ( (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) )^{1/2} - 1 ] e^{2i δ_l}.

Since (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) = e^{2i δ_l}, then the square root is e^{i δ_l}.

So f_l = (1/k) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] e^{2i δ_l} = (1/k) [ e^{3 i δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ].

So the imaginary part of f_l is (1/k) [ sin(3 δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ].

So for each l, the contribution to Im f(0) is (2l+1) * (1/k) [ sin(3 δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ].

Wait, but wait, k is the wave number. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. So I need to compute k.

The relativistic energy of an electron is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But for an electron with energy E = 50 MeV, which is much larger than its rest mass (0.511 MeV), we can approximate p ≈ E / c. So the momentum p is about 50 MeV/c.

The wave number k is given by k = p / ħ c. So k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) ) = (50 MeV) / (ħ c^2) * c/(c) ) Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So 1/ħ c ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) = 5.056e-3 fm^{-1} per MeV.

So k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) ) = (50 MeV) / ħ c. Since ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, then k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute that: 50 divided by approximately 197.33 is around 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Now, for each l, compute the term (2l+1) * (1/k) [ sin(3 δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ].

But wait, the question gives the phase shifts in degrees. I'll need to convert them to radians for the sine function. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sine of degrees directly, but it's better to convert to radians.

Let me make a table for each l from 0 to 4:

For l=0:

δ_0 = 90° → π/2 radians.

Compute sin(3δ_0) = sin(270°) = -1.

sin(δ_0) = sin(90°) = 1.

So sin(3δ) - sin(δ) = (-1) - 1 = -2.

The term for l=0 is (2*0+1) * (1/k) * (-2) = 1 * (1/0.253) * (-2) ≈ 3.9526 * (-2) ≈ -7.9052 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but wait a second. The units here are going to be important. Because k has units of fm^{-1}, so (1/k) has units of fm. So each term for l is (2l+1) * [sin(3δ_l) - sin(δ_l)] * (1/k).

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which has units of fm. Because the scattering amplitude f has units of fm (since cross-section is in fm^2, and f is proportional to cross-section divided by k, which is fm^{-1}, so f has units of fm).

So for each l, the term is (2l+1) * (1/k) * [sin(3δ_l) - sin(δ_l)].

But wait, let me check for l=0:

sin(3*90) = sin(270) = -1.

sin(90) = 1.

So difference: -2.

Multiply by (2*0+1) =1: 1 * (-2) = -2.

Multiply by (1/k) ≈ 3.9526 fm.

So the term is -2 *3.9526 ≈ -7.9052 fm.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part, so this negative term would contribute. Hmm, but let me proceed for each l.

l=1: δ_1=67°.

Calculate 3δ_1=201°, which is in the third quadrant. Sin(201°) = sin(180+21) = -sin(21) ≈ -0.3584.

Sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205.

So sin(3δ) - sinδ = (-0.3584)-(0.9205) ≈ -1.2789.

Multiply by (2*1+1)=3: 3*(-1.2789)= -3.8367.

Multiply by (1/k) ≈3.9526: -3.8367 *3.9526 ≈ -15.168 fm.

l=2: δ_2=55°.

3δ=165°. Sin(165)=sin(180-15)=sin(15)≈0.2588.

Sin(55)≈0.8192.

So sin(3δ) - sinδ= 0.2588 - 0.8192≈-0.5604.

Multiply by (2*2+1)=5:5*(-0.5604)= -2.802.

Multiply by (1/k)≈3.9526: -2.802 *3.9526≈-11.085 fm.

l=3: δ_3=30°.

3δ=90°. Sin(90)=1.

Sin(30)=0.5.

So sin(3δ) - sinδ =1 -0.5=0.5.

Multiply by (2*3+1)=7:7*0.5=3.5.

Multiply by (1/k):3.5 *3.9526≈13.834 fm.

l=4: δ_4=13°.

3δ=39°. Sin(39)≈0.6293.

Sin(13)≈0.2249.

So difference:0.6293 -0.2249≈0.4044.

Multiply by (2*4+1)=9:9 *0.4044≈3.64.

Multiply by (1/k):3.64 *3.9526≈14.385 fm.

Now, sum all these contributions:

l=0:≈-7.905 fm

l=1:≈-15.168 fm

l=2:≈-11.085 fm

l=3:≈13.834 fm

l=4:≈14.385 fm

Adding them up:

-7.905 -15.168 = -23.073.

-23.073 -11.085 = -34.158.

-34.158 +13.834 = -20.324.

-20.324 +14.385= -5.939 fm.

Wait, but this gives a sum of approximately -5.939 fm. But looking at the options, none of the options are close to this number. Let me double-check my calculations because clearly I can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Maybe the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l). Oh! Because earlier I thought about sin(2δ) in the expression, perhaps I confused the terms.

Wait, another approach: from scattering theory, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im f(0)= (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ).

Because for each l, the amplitude's imaginary part comes from the sin(2 δ) term. So perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect because I used sin(3δ) - sin δ, but perhaps it's much simpler: it's just (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) multiplied by 1/k.

Wait, that would make more sense. Because each term in the sum would be (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l) * (1/k). So let's recompute with this approach.

So for each l, compute (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l) * (1/k).

Let me recalculate each term:

k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}, so (1/k)≈3.9526 fm.

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°. sin(180)=0. So term is (1)*0*(3.95) =0.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°. sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193.

(2*1+1)=3. So 3*0.7193=2.1579.

Multiply by (1/k): 2.1579*3.9526≈8.520 fm.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110°. sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

(2*2+1)=5. 5 *0.9397=4.6985.

Multiply by 3.9526: 4.6985 *3.9526≈18.465 fm.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60°. sin60≈0.8660.

(2*3+1)=7. 7 *0.8660≈6.062.

Multiply by 3.9526:≈6.062 *3.9526≈24.084 fm.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26°. sin26≈0.4384.

(2*4+1)=9. 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Multiply by 3.9526:≈3.9456 *3.9526≈15.595 fm.

Now, sum all terms:

l=0:0 → l=1:8.520 → l=2:18.465 → l=3:24.084 → l=4:15.595.

Sum: 8.520 +18.465 =27. 27 +24.084=51.084. 51.084 +15.595=66.679 fm.

Wait, but this is about 66.68 fm. But looking at the options, the closest is option A) 87163.4 fm, which is way bigger. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Wait, let's think about the formula again. I've read that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) times sin(2δ_l). But where does that come from?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). Let me check that.

If that's the case, then the sum would be:

Sum for each l:

l=0: 1 * sin(180) =0 → 0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Multiply by (1/(2k))= (1/(2*0.253))= 1/0.506 ≈1.9762 fm.

So 16.864 *1.9762 ≈ around 33.29 fm.

But none of the options match this either. Hmm. I must be making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. I recall that for the forward scattering amplitude, the imaginary part can be written as Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ). So let me use that.

Each term is (2l+1)*sin(2 δ_l), sum them, multiply by 1/(2k).

Let me recompute with this formula.

Compute sum for each l:

l=0: delta=90°, 2 delta=180°, sin=0 → term=1*0=0.

l=1: delta=67°, 2 delta=134°. sin(134)=0.7193. Term=3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2: delta=55°, 2 delta=110°. sin(110)=0.9397. Term=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: delta=30°, 2 delta=60°. sin(60)=0.8660. Term=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: delta=13°, 2 delta=26°. sin(26)=0.4384. Term=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1/(2*0.253)=1/0.506≈1.9762 fm.

16.864 *1.9762 ≈ approximately 33.29 fm.

But looking back at the options, none of them are close to 33.29. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B) 355.351 fm, C) 177.675 fm, D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, that's way off. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ). Because for each partial wave, the amplitude's imaginary part is proportional to sin(δ_l). Let's try that.

Compute for each l:

l=0: sin(90)=1 → term=1 *1=1.

l=1: sin(67)=0.9205 → term=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2: sin(55)=0.8192 → term=5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5 → term=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: sin(13)=0.2249 → term=9 *0.2249≈2.0241.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0241≈13.3816.

Multiply by (1/k)≈3.9526 →13.3816 *3.9526≈52.95 fm.

Still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should be summing (2l+1)* δ_l (in radians) times some factor. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ). Let me recheck:

sum is 16.864, multiplied by 1/(2k)=1.9762 → 33.29 fm. Still no match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the value of k. Let me re-calculate k.

The energy is 50 MeV. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. Since 50 MeV is much larger than m c^2, we can approximate the momentum p as p ≈ sqrt(2 m E), but perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

Wait, the exact formula for the momentum p of an electron with energy E is p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / c.

Wait, but let's compute it correctly.

E = 50 MeV.

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So E² = (50)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2.

m² c^4 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So E² - m² c^4 =2500 -0.261≈2499.739 (MeV)^2.

p c = sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.997 MeV.

So p = (49.997 MeV) / c.

The wave number k is given by k = p / (ħ c).

We know that ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (49.997 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm/c) ) → 49.997 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So my earlier calculation of k was correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Let's see if I can find the correct expression.

Upon reflection, I think the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ).

Wait, that gives us around 66.68 fm as calculated earlier. But the options are much larger. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2i k) ) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), but that seems unlikely because it would introduce a factor of i, which isn't present in the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ).

Wait, earlier when I used this, I got approximately 33.29 fm. But the options are much higher, so perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else. The units of f are in fm, so the options are in fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times 33.29. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, when I calculated k, I had k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}, which is correct. 1/k ≈3.9526 fm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should use them in radians. Let me recompute the sum with δ in radians.

Compute each l again:

l=0: δ=90°=π/2 radians.

sin(2δ)=sin(π)=0 → term=1 *0=0.

l=1: δ=67° → 67° * π/180 ≈1.169 radians.

2δ ≈2.338 radians. sin(2.338) ≈sin(134°)=0.7193.

So term=3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2: δ=55° →55 * π/180≈0.9599 radians.

2δ=1.9198 radians. sin(1.9198)≈0.9397.

Term=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: δ=30° →0.5236 radians.

2δ=1.0472 radians. sin(1.0472)=0.8660.

Term=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13° →0.2269 radians.

2δ≈0.4538 radians. sin(0.4538)=0.4384.

Term=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum=0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1/(2*0.253)≈1.9762 → 16.864 *1.9762≈33.29 fm.

Same result as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the electrons are charged particles and the scattering amplitude includes factors of the charge or something else. Wait, the phase shifts are given, so perhaps I should be using them directly without considering the charge. Alternatively, maybe the phase shifts are given in the Born approximation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the relation between the optical theorem and the imaginary part of the amplitude, but I can't see where I'm going wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

But that would involve complex terms.

Wait, let me expand e^{2i δ} -1. That's 2i sin δ e^{i δ}, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, e^{2i δ} -1 = e^{i δ} (e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ}) ) = e^{i δ} * 2i sin δ.

So e^{2i δ} -1 = 2i e^{i δ} sin δ.

So the imaginary part of (e^{2i δ} -1) is 2 e^{i δ} sin δ * (-i) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of (e^{2i δ} -1) is 2 sin δ cos δ.

Wait, because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{2i δ} = cos 2δ + i sin 2δ. So e^{2i δ} -1 = (cos2δ -1) + i sin2δ.

The imaginary part is sin2δ.

So, Im[ e^{2i δ} -1 ] = sin(2δ).

So Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ).

Which brings me back to the same expression as before. So the sum is 16.864, multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9762, giving approximately 33.29 fm.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form δ_l^o, which already includes the (U_l + V_l)/(U_l - V_l) term. Or perhaps I should multiply by something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), but earlier that gave about 52.95 fm, which is still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of the sum, so taking the absolute value. But that wouldn't help because the sum is positive.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, I found a reference that says that the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is given by Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ).

Wait, let me try that.

Compute each term:

l=0: sin(90)=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1: sin(67)≈0.9205 →3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2: sin(55)≈0.8192 →5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: sin(13)≈0.2249 →9 *0.2249≈2.0241.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0241≈13.3816.

Multiply by 1/k ≈3.9526 →13.3816 *3.9526≈52.95 fm.

Still no match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), as earlier, giving 33.29 fm, which is not an option.

Looking at the options again, the given options are much larger, but perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me think about the calculation of k.

Wait, wait, the calculation of k:

k = p / (ħ c).

p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.

E=50 MeV.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV / c.

k = (50 MeV/c ) / (ħ c ) → 50 / (197.33 MeV fm^{-1} ) )= 50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so that's correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps the answer is 355.351 fm, which is option B. How can I get that number?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) × (1/k) × sin(2δ_l), without dividing by 2.

Wait, when I did that earlier, I got 66.68 fm. Which is still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

But then, the imaginary part would involve the imaginary parts of each term.

Wait, e^{2i δ} -1 = cos(2δ) -1 + i sin(2δ).

The imaginary part is sin(2δ), which brings me back to the same formula as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

In that case, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), which is what I did earlier. So same result.

Hmm, maybe I should try another approach. Perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude, not the total. But the question says the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is the forward direction, so the total.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in u units (nuclear units) and need to be converted. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in terms of the scattering angles, but I think they're given as δ_l values.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute the sum for each l, being precise.

l=0: 2δ=180°, sin=0 → term=0.

l=1: 2δ=134°, sin=0.7193 →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: 2δ=110°, sin=0.9397 →5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3: 2δ=60°, sin=0.8660→7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4: 2δ=26°, sin=0.4384→9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9762 →16.864 *1.9762=33.29 fm.

Hmm. Still not matching any option. Perhaps I should check if the phase shifts are given in radians?

Wait, the phase shifts given are in degrees, but perhaps I should treat them as radians. Let me check.

For l=0: 90°=π/2 radians.

sin(2δ)=sin(π)=0 → term=0.

l=1:67°=1.169 radians.

sin(2δ)=sin(2.338)≈0.7193.

So term=3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:55°=0.9599 radians.

sin(1.9198)=0.9397.

Term=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:30°=0.5236 radians.

sin(1.0472)=0.8660.

Term=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:13°=0.2269 radians.

sin(0.4538)=0.4384.

Term=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

So sum is same as before:16.864.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.9762 →33.29 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in multiples of π/2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which gives 52.95 fm.

But that's not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the phase shifts are given for l=0 to 4, and higher l are zero. So the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part instead of the imaginary part. That would give a different result, but the question clearly states the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are being treated as their values in some other manner. For instance, perhaps they're given in degrees, but the calculation requires their use in some other way.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) × (1/k) × sin(δ_l ), but that gives 52.95 fm.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the options match my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

But then the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), which is the same as before.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach using the partial wave expansion.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude is given by f(θ)= sum ( (2l+1) * ( ( U_l + V_l )/( U_l - V_l ) )^{1/2} * sin δ_l / cos δ_l ) * e^{2i δ_l} ) * P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= sum ( (2l+1) * sqrt( (U_l+V_l)/(U_l-V_l) ) * sin δ_l / cos δ_l ) * e^{2i δ_l}.

But sqrt( (U_l+V_l)/(U_l-V_l) )=e^{i δ_l}, so f(0)= sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} * sin δ_l / cos δ_l ) e^{2i δ_l} }.

Simplify inside the sum:

e^{i δ_l} * e^{2i δ_l} = e^{3i δ_l}.

So f(0)= sum ( (2l+1) e^{3i δ_l} * (sin δ_l / cos δ_l) ).

Which can be written as sum ( (2l+1) e^{3i δ_l} tan δ_l ).

The imaginary part of f(0) is sum ( (2l+1) * Im[ e^{3i δ_l} tan δ_l ] ).

Let me compute each term:

e^{3i δ} = cos(3δ) + i sin(3δ).

tan δ = sin δ / cos δ.

So Im[ e^{3i δ} tan δ ] = [ cos(3δ) * (sin δ / cos δ) ) * i ] + [ sin(3δ) * (sin δ / cos δ) ) ].

Wait, no, more accurately, e^{3i δ} tan δ = [ cos(3δ) + i sin(3δ) ] * [ sin δ / cos δ ].

So the imaginary part is sin(3δ) * (sin δ / cos δ ).

So Im f(0) = sum ( (2l+1) * [ sin(3δ) * (sin δ) / cos δ ] )

= sum ( (2l+1) * [ sin(3δ) tan δ ] )

But this seems more complicated than before. Let me compute each term:

For l=0:

δ=90°, sin(3δ)=sin(270)= -1.

tan(90) is undefined (infinite). So this term would be problematic. Hmm, that's an issue. So perhaps this approach is leading me into trouble, especially for l=0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use l=0 to 4 and compute each term.

But for l=0, δ=90°, so tan(90) is infinite, which would make the term undefined. But that can't be correct. So perhaps this approach is not suitable.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is Im f(0)= sum ( (2l+1) * (1/k) * [ sin(3 δ_l) - sin δ_l ] ).

Which is what I did earlier, leading to a sum of approximately -5.94 fm.

But that's way off the given options.

Hmm. At this point, I'm a bit stuck. My calculated results don't match the options provided. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Let me compute that again with precise numbers.

Compute each term:

l=0: sin(90)=1 →1 *1=1.

l=1: sin(67)=0.9205 →3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2: sin(55)=0.8192 →5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: sin(13)=0.2249 →9 *0.2249=2.0241.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0241=13.3816.

Multiply by (1/k)=3.9526 →13.3816 *3.9526≈52.95 fm.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), but I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, 1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.253)=1/0.506≈1.9762.

sum=16.864 →16.864 *1.9762≈33.29 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in the form where δ_o is for l=0, but perhaps the formula uses 2l+1 in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in the form where they've already been multiplied by (2l+1), but that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l +1) factor in front, but that's what I've been doing.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in the form δ_o^o, δ_1^o, etc., and perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are being treated as exponents, but that seems unlikely.

At this point, I'm not sure where the mistake lies. My calculations don't align with the provided options. However, considering the options, the closest I have is 33.29 fm, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), which gives ~52.95 fm. But that's still not among the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 251.271 fm. Hmm, 251 is approximately 33 *7.6. But I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum without dividing by 2k. Let me see:

sum=16.864 →16.864 * (1/k)=16.864 *3.9526≈66.68 fm.

But this is option A: 87163.4 fm, which is way bigger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check.

E=50 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈50 MeV →p=50 MeV /c.

k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) )=50/(197.33)≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Yes, correct.

Another thought: perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) × (1/k) × [sin(2 δ_l )], without any division.

Which would give 66.68 fm, which is option B: 355.351 fm, no, that's not matching.

Wait, 66.68 is not an option. The closest is option B: 355.351 fm. 355 is about 5 times 71. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 5.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply the sum by (1/k)^2. Let's see: (1/k ) is 3.9526 fm. (1/k)^2 is 15.62 fm².

sum=16.864 →16.864 *15.62≈263 fm². But the options have units of fm, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by (1/k)^2 and then take the square root. 263 fm² →sqrt(263)≈16.22 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Born approximation, but I'm not sure.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and might need to make an educated guess. However, given that none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times 33.29, but I can't see where a factor of 10 would come from.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum without the 2 in denominator, so Im f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), which gives 66.68 fm.

But that's not an option either. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum with (2l+1) × sin(δ_l ), and then multiply by (1/k), which gives 52.95 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), which gives 33.29 fm. But that's not an option either.

Given that, I'm not certain where the mistake is, but perhaps the correct answer is option B: 355.351 fm. But I'm not confident.

The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the forward direction (θ = 0) for elastic electron scattering from a nuclear target. The phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$ are provided, and higher $l$ contributions are ignored. The goal is to compute the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude using these phase shifts.

### Key Formula and Approach
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ = 0 is given by:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar c}, \quad p = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} / c.
\]

For $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$ and $m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$, the momentum $p$ is approximated as $p \approx E / c = 50 \, \text{MeV}/c$. Using $\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$, the wave number is:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Calculation
For each $l$, compute the contribution to the sum:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

#### Step 1: Compute $\sin(2\delta_l)$ for each $l$
- $l = 0$: $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0$.
- $l = 1$: $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193$.
- $l = 2$: $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397$.
- $l = 3$: $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, $\sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660$.
- $l = 4$: $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$, $\sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384$.

#### Step 2: Compute contributions for each $l$
\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{0.253} \left[ 
(2 \cdot 0 + 1) \cdot 0 + 
(2 \cdot 1 + 1) \cdot 0.7193 + 
(2 \cdot 2 + 1) \cdot 0.9397 + 
(2 \cdot 3 + 1) \cdot 0.8660 + 
(2 \cdot 4 + 1) \cdot 0.4384 
\right].
\]

- $l = 0$: $1 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- $l = 1$: $3 \cdot 0.7193 = 2.1579$.
- $l = 2$: $5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985$.
- $l = 3$: $7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062$.
- $l = 4$: $9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456$.

#### Step 3: Sum contributions and multiply by $1/k$
\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{0.253} \left[ 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \right].
\]

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{0.253} \cdot 16.864 \approx 33.29 \, \text{fm}.
\]
