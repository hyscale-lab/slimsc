Okay, so I've got this problem about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the RV method. So, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because Kepler's third law says shorter period implies closer orbit for the same mass system.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. That's interesting because I thought more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_1's star is in a different stage or perhaps it's a main-sequence star that's more massive but same size as a slightly evolved star? Not sure, but the important point is their radii are the same.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The formula for transit probability, as I recall, is R_p / R_s, where R_p is the planet's radius and R_s is the star's radius. Wait, no, actually, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times the probability related to the orbital inclination. Oh wait, no, I might be mixing something up.

Wait, the transit probability is more accurately given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a ) ) where 'a' is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_s))², but no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by 1/(a (1-e²)^0.5)), but wait, no, that's the formula for the transit duration. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relative size of the planet's orbital plane as seen from Earth.

The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is given by P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but no, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * something else. Wait, maybe I'm better off thinking about the formula again.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, because the area blocked by the planet is a circle with radius R_p, so the area is π(R_p)^2. The area of the star is π(R_s)^2, so the probability is (R_p/R_s)^2 times the probability that the orbital plane is aligned. Oh, but the alignment part depends on the inclination.

Wait no, the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned within the small angle needed for a transit is 1/(sqrt(1 - b²)), where b is the impact parameter. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_s / a), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about Kepler's third law here. Since both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and different stellar masses. Let me get the semi-major axis for each planet.

Kepler's third law: (P^2) = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So, P² = (4π²/(G M)) * a³. Rearranging, a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So, a = [(G M P²)/(4π²)]^(1/3).

But wait, since we're comparing a₁ (Planet_1's semi-major axis) and a₂ (Planet_2's), perhaps we can find a ratio.

Given that M1 = 2 M2 (since Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's), and P1 = P2 /3.

So, let's compute a₁ and a₂.

a₁ = [ (G M1 P1²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

a₂ = [ (G M2 P2²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

But P2 = 3 P1, so P2² = 9 P1².

So,

a₁ = [ (G * 2 M2 * (P1²) ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

a₂ = [ (G * M2 * (9 P1²) ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the ratio a₁/a₂:

a₁/a₂ = [ (2 M2 P1²) / (9 M2 P1²) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a₂ is larger than a₁, which makes sense since Planet_1 has a shorter period and the star is more massive, so it's closer.

But how does this relate to transit probability?

Transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) (since the area blocked is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2, and the solid angle is a function of a). Wait, no, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)² * (R_s / (a))² ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it in terms of the transit probability formula.

The probability of a transit is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s)² / (a² (1 - e²))² ) * (1 / cos i), but for circular orbits, e=0 and i is 90 degrees for edge-on. Wait, no, perhaps the probability is [ (R_p + R_s) / (a) ]² * (1 / sqrt(1 - b²)) ), where b is the impact parameter. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a simpler approach. The transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area that would cause a transit. Wait, no, that's not right.

Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front.

Wait, the alignment probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for the transit. For a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the planet transits is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not confident about that.

Wait, I think that the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_p + R_s) / a. Because the planet must be within a certain distance from the center of the star's disk as seen from Earth. So the effective area is (R_p + R_s)², and the total area is π a², but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, because that's the ratio of the sum of the radii to the semi-major axis. So, if a is large relative to R_p and R_s, the probability is small.

But in this problem, both planets have Earth-like radii, and their host stars have the same radius. Let's denote R_s as same for both (since host stars have same radii). So, R_p is same for both, because they're Earth-like.

So, P ∝ (R_p + R_s) / a.

But since R_p and R_s are same for both planets, (R_p + R_s) is same for both. So P is inversely proportional to a.

So, P1 ∝ 1/a1, P2 ∝ 1/a2.

But from earlier, a2 is larger than a1, so 1/a1 > 1/a2. So, P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, but let me redo the a ratio. I calculated a₁/a₂ ≈ 0.606, meaning a₂ is ~1.65 times a₁.

So, a2 = a1 * (1/0.606) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So, P1 = (R_p + R_s)/a1.

P2 = (R_p + R_s)/a2 = (R_p + R_s)/(1.65 a1) ≈ 0.606 * (R_p + R_s)/a1.

So, P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Wait, so the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of about 1.65.

Wait, but the options have options where Planet_1 is preferred with 1.65 times higher probability (option C), and Planet_2 is preferred with 1.5 or 2.25 times.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the probability is (R_p + R_s)/a. Since R_p and R_s are same, so P is inversely proportional to a.

If a2 = 1.65 a1, then P2 = P1 * (a1/a2) = P1 * (1/1.65) ≈ 0.606 P1.

So, P1 is ~1.65 times higher than P2. So, Planet_1 has a higher probability, so researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Wait, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but earlier calculation for a2 is 1.65 a1, so P1 is 1.65 times higher. So, option C is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the a ratio.

Given M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P2 /3.

So, substituting into the a equation.

a1^3 = (G M1 P1²) / (4π²)

a2^3 = (G M2 P2²) / (4π²)

But P2 = 3 P1, so P2²=9 P1².

So,

a1^3 = (G * 2 M2 * P1²) / (4π²)

a2^3 = (G * M2 * 9 P1²) / (4π²)

Dividing a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = (2 M2 P1²) / (9 M2 P1²) ) = 2/9.

So, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So, P1 = (R_p + R_s) / a1.

P2 = same numerator / (1.65 a1) => P2 = P1 / 1.65.

Which means P1 is 1.65 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1, which is option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

So, the correct answer is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability of a transit is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the sum of the planet's and star's radii, \( P \propto \frac{R_p + R_s}{a} \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same mass and their host stars have the same radius, \( R_p + R_s \) is constant for both. Thus, the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis \( a \), meaning a smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M} \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star, we calculate the semi-major axis ratio \( a_1/a_2 \). Given that Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)) and Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter (\( P_1 = P_2/3 \)), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_2 P_1^2}{M_1 P_2^2} = \frac{M_2 (P_2/3)^2}{2M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{1}{18}.
\]

Taking the cube root, \( a_1/a_2 = (1/18)^{1/3} \approx 0.606 \), or equivalently, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Thus, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability.
