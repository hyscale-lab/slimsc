Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix is located in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that the density matrix for a qubit is a 2x2 matrix, and its representation in the Bloch sphere involves some coordinates. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me expand this. Each term is a projector: |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner, and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the bottom-right. So when I add them, each diagonal element becomes 1. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the diagonal becomes 1/2 each. The off-diagonal elements are zero.

So ρ looks like:
[ [0.5, 0],
  [0, 0.5] ]

Wait, that's interesting. I remember that the diagonal terms correspond to the Bloch sphere coordinates. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x, y, z) with magnitude ≤1.

So let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each contributes to the off-diagonal terms and the diagonal. Let's see.

The identity matrix I gives (I/2) as:
[ [0.5, 0],
  [0, 0.5] ]

Which is exactly what we have for ρ. That means the other terms, r·σ, must sum to zero. Because when I add (r·σ)/2 to I/2, it's equal to ρ.

Wait, let me write it out. So if I have:

ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2

But our ρ is (I)/2, so that implies that r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 is our ρ.

What's each Pauli matrix? Let me think.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

If the sum of r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz is zero matrix, then each component must be zero.

So for each element in the matrix, let's compute the sum.

The (1,1) element:
r_z * 1 (from σz) + 0 (from σx) + 0 (from σy) = r_z = 0?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when you add the matrices:

r_x σx looks like [[0, r_x], [r_x, 0]]
r_y σy is [[0, -i r_y], [i r_y, 0]]
r_z σz is [[r_z, 0], [0, -r_z]]

So summing these three:

The (1,1) element is r_z
The (1,2) element is r_x - i r_y
The (2,1) element is r_x + i r_y
The (2,2) element is -r_z

So the sum must be zero matrix. So each element must be zero.

So:

r_z = 0 (from (1,1) and (2,2) being 0)
r_x - i r_y = 0
r_x + i r_y = 0

From the first equation, r_x = i r_y. But r_x and r_y are real numbers because they're components of a real vector. So the only way this can be true is if both r_x and r_y are zero. Because if r_x is a real number and equals i r_y, which is imaginary, the only possibility is both are zero.

So r_x = 0, r_y =0, r_z=0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but the density matrix ρ is a completely mixed state because it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. Oh right, because it's I/2, that's the maximally mixed state. And in the Bloch sphere representation, the completely mixed state is at the origin, i.e., r = (0,0,0). Because that's the center of the sphere.

So the correct option is C) r=(0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding this, we find:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{2} 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix corresponds to the maximally mixed state of a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any qubit state can be written as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a real vector with \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \), and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this general form to the given density matrix, we see that the off-diagonal terms must vanish, and the diagonal terms must match. This implies that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \), meaning \( r_x = 0 \), \( r_y = 0 \), and \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( (0, 0, 0) \).
