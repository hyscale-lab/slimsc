Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all that. But let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, which probably means we can use standard constants without worrying about temperature effects on them.

Wait, the problem also gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Oh right, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, and each deprotonation has its own Ka.

I remember that orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-. So, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution. Hmm, but wait, how do these salts dissociate?

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, I think it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, K+ is a spectator ion, and the H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4's first dissociation. Or wait, wait. Let me think: H3PO4 can lose three H+ ions. So, H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (losing first H+). Then H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (second dissociation). And HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (third dissociation). So, the salts here are providing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the other salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate, I think. When that dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water of crystallization, but that probably doesn't matter for the concentration. So, Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh, because KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

Wait a minute, that combination sounds like a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+), but wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 is triprotic:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, H2PO4^- is the acid in the second dissociation (since it donates H+ to become HPO4^2-), but wait, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton) or a base (accepting a proton). Hmm, but in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Because in buffer solutions, you usually have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So, if you have a solution with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, those are two steps apart. Because H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4, but HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in this case, are they a buffer for the second dissociation step? Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, which would involve Ka2.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer for the second dissociation step. Wait, because we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. So, H2PO4^- is a weak acid (from H3PO4 losing one H+), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's consider the species present. KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and K+.

Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2- and Na+.

So, in the solution, the species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate H+) to become HPO4^2- (since H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-), which is the second dissociation (Ka2).

Wait, so the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- form a buffer solution involving the second dissociation. Because H2PO4^- is the acid (can donate a proton) and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base.

Wait, no, wait. If H2PO4^- is the acid, then the buffer is for the second dissociation (Ka2). Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be applied here. The pH of the solution will depend on the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) to the acid (H2PO4^-).

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Oh, right, so PO4^3- is the third deprotonation step. So, that would come from HPO4^2- accepting another proton. But in the solution, HPO4^2- can act as a base and accept a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but if we have HPO4^2- in solution, under what conditions would it deprotonate further? Well, the solution's pH would determine that. But since we have a buffer involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps the pH is around the pKa2 of H3PO4.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So, if I can find the pH using the ratio of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, then I can find out how much HPO4^2- is deprotonated to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the dissociations. So, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 is 1.8e-12). So, the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the pH and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
2. Use these concentrations to find the pH of the solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])).
3. Then, use the third dissociation expression (Ka3) to find [PO4^3-], given that [HPO4^2-] is known and pH is known.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- in solution, which is present in the solution. So, using Ka3, we can find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But knowing [H+] requires knowing the pH, which we can find from the buffer solution.

Wait, but let me start by calculating the moles of each salt.

First, find the moles of KH2PO4:

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So,

moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007338 mol.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

So, in the solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007338 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.

Wait, but wait. Are these the concentrations of the ions in solution? Because each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So yes, the concentrations are as I calculated: [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). Wait, pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

So,

pH = 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.03669)

Calculating the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.766.

log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.207 -0.114 ≈7.093.

Alternatively, more accurately, let me compute the ratio precisely.

0.028065 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.7663.

log(0.7663) ≈-0.114.

So pH ≈7.207 -0.114=7.093.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find [PO4^3-].

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have [HPO4^2-]=0.028065 M. [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) ≈6.65e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 6.65e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈5.0517e-14.

Divide by 6.65e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 6.65e-8 = (5.0517 /6.65) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /6.65 ≈ 0.7606.

So, 0.7606e-6 = 7.606e-7 M.

Wait, but that's approximately 7.6e-7 M. Looking at the options, the closest is option D:3.97e-7, option B:5.48e-7, option C:2.81e-7, option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, 7.6e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03669.

Let me calculate that more accurately.

0.028065 divided by 0.03669.

Let me compute 0.028065 / 0.03669.

Compute approximately:

0.028065 /0.03669 = (28.065e-3) / (36.69e-3) )=28.065/36.69 ≈0.766.

But let me compute more precisely.

36.69 *0.766 = 36.69 *0.7 =25.683; 36.69 *0.06=2.2014; 36.69 *0.006=0.22014. Sum: 25.683+2.2014=27.8844 +0.22014=28.1045. Hmm, but 0.766 *36.69 ≈28.1045; but the numerator is 28.065. So, 28.065/36.69 = approximately 0.766.

But wait, 0.766 might be a little less. Let me compute 36.69 * 0.765=?

0.7 *36.69 =25.683.

0.06 *36.69=2.2014.

0.005 *36.69=0.18345.

So total 25.683+2.2014=27.8844 +0.18345=28.06785.

Ah, so 0.765 *36.69=28.06785, which is very close to 28.065. So the ratio is approximately 0.765.

So, log(0.765) is approximately?

Log(0.765) = log(7.65e-1) = log(7.65) + log(10^-1) = 0.8843 -1 = -0.1157.

So, pH =7.207 -0.1157 ≈7.0913.

So, more precisely, pH is about 7.091.

Then, [H+]=10^(-7.091) ≈ 7.89e-8 M.

Wait, wait, no. Because pH is 7.091, so [H+] is 10^-7.091 ≈7.89e-8 M? Wait, wait let me calculate 10^(-7.091).

Wait, 10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.091)= approx 0.856. So, 1e-7 * 0.856=8.56e-8. So [H+]≈8.56e-8.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for better precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using exact expressions instead of approximations.

But perhaps another approach is to compute [PO4^3-] using the exact expression:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have Ka3=1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-]=0.028065 M, and [H+]=1e-pH =1e-7.0913 ≈8.56e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.56e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028065 =5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.56e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 /8.56e-8 = (5.0517 /8.56) *1e-6.

5.0517 /8.56 ≈0.59.

So, 0.59e-6 =5.9e-7 M.

Hmm, so approximately 5.9e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.48e-7, option D is 3.97e-7, option A is 6.24e-7.

Wait, but I'm getting 5.9e-7, which is closest to option B (5.48e-7) and option A (6.24e-7). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the [H+] calculation. Let me compute the pH more accurately.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =0.028065 / 0.03669.

Compute exact value:

0.028065 ÷ 0.03669.

= 28065 /36690 = let me compute 28065 ÷36690. Let me compute 28065 ÷36690.

Compute 36690 × 0.765 = ?

36690 ×0.7=25,683.

36690 ×0.06=2,201.4.

36690 ×0.005=183.45.

Sum: 25,683 +2,201.4=27,884.4; +183.45=28,067.85.

So, 0.765 ×36690=28,067.85. The numerator is 28,065, so the ratio is 28,065/36,690 = approximately 0.765 - (28,067.85 -28,065)/36690 → 2.85/36690≈0.0000776.

So, 0.765 - 0.0000776≈0.764922.

So log(0.764922) = ?

Log(0.7649) → let me think about it.

Log(0.75)= -0.1249, log(0.76)= around -0.1178, log(0.7649)=?

Wait, using a calculator method: 

We know that log(7.649) is approximately 0.8846 (since 10^0.8846 ≈7.649).

So, log(0.7649)= log(7.649e-1)= 0.8846 -1= -0.1154.

So, the pH is pKa2 + log(ratio) →7.207 -0.1154=7.0916.

So, pH≈7.0916.

Then, [H+]=10^-7.0916.

Compute 10^-7.0916= 10^(-7 -0.0916)=1e-7 *10^-0.0916.

10^(-0.0916)= approx 0.856.

Wait, 10^-0.0916=about 0.856? Let me compute more accurately.

Natural logarithm: ln(0.856)= ln(8.56e-1)= ln(8.56) -1 → approx 2.147 -1=1.147.

Wait, no, wait. 10^(-0.0916)= e^(ln(10)*-0.0916)=e^(-0.0916 *2.3026)=e^(-0.2107)= approx 0.810.

Wait, 0.810 is closer. Because 10^-0.0916 is 1/(10^0.0916). 10^0.0916 is approx 1.237 (since 10^0.09 ≈1.23, 10^0.0916≈1.23).

Wait, 10^0.0916 = e^(0.0916 * ln10)= e^(0.0916 *2.3026)= e^(0.2108)= approx 1.234.

So 1/1.234≈0.810.

So [H+]=1e-7 *0.810=8.1e-8 M.

Ah, so [H+]=8.1e-8 M.

Then, [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 *0.028065)/(8.1e-8).

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.028065=5.0517e-14.

Denominator:8.1e-8.

So,5.0517e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0517/8.1)*1e-6.

5.0517 ÷8.1≈0.6237.

So, 0.6237e-6 =6.237e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. So that's very close.

But wait, earlier I thought I got 5.9e-7, but perhaps that was from a less accurate [H+]. So, recalculating with [H+]=8.1e-8, the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.24e-7 M.

Which matches option A.

But wait, looking back, why is the [HPO4^2-] 0.028065 M and [H2PO4^-] 0.03669 M.

Wait, but when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the solution may have some PO4 species in different forms. But perhaps I'm correct in assuming that [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] are as I calculated.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors I'm missing? For example, does the solution volume change upon mixing the salts? No, the solution's volume is given as 200 cm³, so I think the moles are simply divided by 0.2 L.

Also, are there any other phosphate species present? Like PO4^3-? Well, in the solution, the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation, but initially, the salts don't provide PO4^3-. So, the initial concentrations are only H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The problem says to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So that would be the concentration coming from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So, according to this, the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.24e-7 M, which corresponds to option A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations:

Moles of KH2PO4:

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007338 mol → [H2PO4^-]=0.007338 /0.2 =0.03669 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:1.00g /177.99 g/mol≈0.005613 mol → [HPO4^2-]=0.005613 /0.2=0.028065 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH= pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2= -log(6.2e-8)=7.207.

Ratio=0.028065 /0.03669=0.765.

Log(0.765)= ~-0.115.

pH=7.207-0.115=7.092.

[H+]=10^-7.092= 8.17e-8.

Then,

[PO4^3-]=(1.8e-12 *0.028065) / (8.17e-8)= (5.05e-14) /8.17e-8= approx 6.18e-7.

Hmm, that's about 6.18e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

So, the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the dissociation constant for the third step of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄). Here's the detailed analysis:

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.007338 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03669 \, \text{M} \).  
  This provides \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = 0.03669 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.005613 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.028065 \, \text{M} \).  
  This provides \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = 0.028065 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) (base), corresponding to the second dissociation of H₃PO₄. The relevant \( \text{pKa}_2 \) is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]
The ratio of concentrations is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.03669} \approx 0.765
\]
The pH is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation of H₃PO₄
The third dissociation is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]
The expression for \( K_a3 \) is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
From the pH, \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.17 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \). Substituting:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.17 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.17 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.18 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
