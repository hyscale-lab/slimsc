Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question here. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if the parallax is smaller, the object is farther away.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The options are all in terms of r, the distance. So we need to figure out how N depends on r.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. But plx is 1/d, so substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, wait, the question is about how it changes per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so the number of stars per unit distance? Or wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting that.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)" — so perhaps they're asking about the differential number of stars with respect to r. Like, how many more stars are there as you move a small distance dr? So that would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, let's think again. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. But if we're looking for how the number changes with r, meaning the rate of change, that's the derivative dN/dr. So the derivative of r^5 is 5r^4. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4. 

So the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance (per unit distance) is proportional to r^4. Let me check the options.

Option C is ~ r^4, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thought—maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases as the fifth power of r. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm, maybe it's the differential change.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number per unit volume, but I'm not sure. But in any case, the reasoning I did earlier about the derivative leading to r^4 seems correct. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), which implies finding the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we get \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). 

Thus, the number of stars increases with distance at a rate proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.
