Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The operator in question is P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The question asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. 

Wait, the operator is a vector, so the overall operator P would be the vector sum of its components: P = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So, the operator becomes P = n_x P_x + 0 * P_y + n_z P_z. 

But wait, n is a unit vector, right? So n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero, I think, so the direction is along θ in the x-z plane. So n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ).

So the operator P is a 2x2 matrix given by (ħ/2)(n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ). Let me write that out. So P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

To find the eigenvectors, I need to solve (P - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Wait, let's compute P - (ħ/2) I. Since P is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], subtracting (ħ/2) I would give:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]].

So the matrix becomes:

[ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ] * [a; b] = 0.

Wait, but since the eigenvector must be non-zero, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. So let's compute the determinant:

|n_z -1     n_x     |
|n_x     -n_z -1| 

The determinant is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Expanding that: (-(n_z)(n_z -1) ) -1*(n_z -1) ) 

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly. (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1)) ) = (-n_z^2 +n_z -n_z +1 ) = (-n_z^2 + 1). Then subtract (n_x)^2, so determinant is (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2. But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, because it's a unit vector, this determinant is (-n_z^2 +1) - (1 - n_z^2) )= (-n_z^2 +1 -1 +n_z^2) = 0. So the determinant is zero, which makes sense as it's an eigenvalue equation.

So the equations from the matrix are:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

These two equations should be consistent. Let's take the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b.

Wait, but n_z can't be 1, because that would make the denominator zero. If n_z=1, then the first equation would be 0*a +n_x b=0 → b=0. Then the second equation would be n_x a + (-1-1) b = 0 → n_x a =0. So a could be any, but since n_x is non-zero if n_z=1? Wait, if n_z=1, then n_x=0, because the direction is along z. So in that case, P is P_z, and the eigenvector would be [1, 0] for eigenvalue +ħ/2, and [0,1] for -ħ/2.

But since the problem says the direction is along n in the x-z plane, n could be any direction in x-z, including the z direction. So perhaps I should handle that as a special case, but perhaps it's better to proceed generally.

Assuming n_z ≠1, so I can write a = [ -n_x/(n_z-1) ] b.

But let me think of this as ratios. So the ratio a/b is -n_x / (n_z -1).

Wait, let me consider that for the eigenvector, we can write the components as a and b. So a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express in terms of θ, since n is along x-z, so n_x=cosθ, n_z=sinθ. Wait, no: n is a unit vector, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, because θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Wait, actually, in standard spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis, with x and z as the plane. So yes, n_x=cosθ, n_z=sinθ.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think: in spherical coordinates, a point on the unit sphere is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So if the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n_x = sinθ * cos 0 = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, that makes sense because when θ=0, the direction is along z, so n_x=0, n_z=1. When θ=90 degrees, n is along x. So n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

So substituting into the ratio a/b = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1) = [ -sinθ ] / (cosθ - 1).

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think of the eigenvector equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalue equation can be simplified by parameterizing.

Wait, I'm perhaps overcomplicating. Let's think about the general form. The operator is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

So the matrix is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

We need to find the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue +1/2 (since the operator is (ħ/2) times the matrix, so the eigenvalue is (ħ/2) * (eigenvalue of the matrix)).

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, with P = (ħ/2) M, where M is the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. So λ = (ħ/2) * m, where m is an eigenvalue of M.

So we need m such that (M - m I) has determinant zero.

The determinant of M - m I is:

(n_z - m)(-n_z - m) - n_x^2 = 0.

Expanding: (-n_z (n_z - m) - m (n_z - m) ) - n_x^2 = 0.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as (n_z - m)(-n_z - m) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Which is (-n_z^2 - m n_z + m n_z + m²) - n_x^2 = 0.

Simplify: (-n_z^2 + m²) - n_x^2 =0 → m² = n_z^2 + n_x^2.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, m²=1 → m=±1.

So the eigenvalues are m=+1 and m=-1. So the eigenvalues for the matrix M are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues for P are (ħ/2)*1= ħ/2 and -(ħ/2).

We are interested in the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so m=1.

So the eigenvectors correspond to m=1.

So the equation for the eigenvector is (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

So the matrix (M - I) is:

[[n_z -1, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z -1]]

Now, to find non-trivial solutions (a, b) such that:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0,

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

These must be consistent. Let me take the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

But let's substitute a into the second equation.

The second equation: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

Substitute a = [ -n_x/(n_z-1) ] b.

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z-1) ] b + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ -n_x²/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x² - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = 0.

Expand the second term: (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z² -1.

So:

- n_x² - (n_z² -1) =0 → -n_x^2 -n_z^2 +1 =0.

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, this becomes 1 -1=0 → 0=0. So the equations are consistent.

So the eigenvectors are given by a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

Wait, but let's express this in terms of θ. Remembering that n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Hmm, let's simplify that.

Denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2).

Numerator: -sinθ= -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So a = [ (-2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] * b.

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels, so:

a = [ (sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / sin²(θ/2) ) ] *b.

Simplify: [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b = cot(θ/2) * b.

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the eigenvector components are a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Let me pick b=1 for simplicity; then a= cot(θ/2). But I need to normalize the vector.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the eigenstate as a linear combination.

Wait, maybe it's easier to write the eigenvector in terms of θ. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's take b=1, then a = cot(θ/2). So the vector is [ a, 1 ] = [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So |cot(θ/2)|^2 +1 =1 → [cot²(θ/2) ] +1 = csc²(θ/2) = 1/sin²(θ/2).

So the norm is 1/sin(θ/2). So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] * sin(θ/2).

Which simplifies to [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ] * sin(θ/2) → [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, let me recompute that. Wait, [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] is [ (cos(θ/2)/(sin(θ/2))), 1 ].

Multiplying by sin(θ/2) gives [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the signs right? Because when θ is 0 (along z), the eigenvector is [1,0], which makes sense for eigenvalue +ħ/2. When θ is π/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [0,1], which should correspond to the eigenvalue, but let's check.

Wait, when θ=π/2, n is along x. So P would be (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, with the eigenvectors [1,1]/√2 for +ħ/2 and [1,-1]/√2 for -ħ/2. Wait, but according to our previous result, when θ=π/2, θ/2 is π/4, so the eigenvector would be [ cos(π/4), sin(π/4) ] = [ √2/2, √2/2 ] which is [1,1]/√2 scaled by √2/2. Hmm, that's incorrect because the correct eigenvector for X is the same as that, but the eigenvalue eigenstate is [1,1]/√2 for +1. So in that case, our calculation matches, so the result seems correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), so that's a good match.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)).

But wait, the eigenvector is [a, b], but the problem statement says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So the eigenvector is a spin-½ state along n, which in this case would have components cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), right? Because in the standard basis, the spin-up state along z is [1,0], which corresponds to theta=0. So when theta is the angle from z, the state is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which looks like spherical coordinates for a 3D vector, but the state here is 2D, so probably not.

Option D has square roots and hbar factors, but I don't see any in our normalized eigenvector. Because the eigenvector components are normalized, so they can't have hbar factors, since hbar is a constant. So options A and D have hbar in their elements, which is not correct because the eigenvectors are dimensionless; they are vectors in Hilbert space, not physical quantities with units.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\cos\theta, 0, \sin\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix},
\]
where $n_x = \cos\theta$ and $n_z = \sin\theta$. The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]
where $| \psi \rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $\vec{P}$ into the eigenvalue equation, we solve for the eigenvector components $a$ and $b$ of $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$.

The eigenvalue equation becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z - 1 & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z - 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
= 0.
\]
From the first row, $(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0$, which gives the ratio:
\[
a = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1} b.
\]
Substituting $n_x = \cos\theta$ and $n_z = \sin\theta$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]
Choosing $b = 1$ for simplicity, the eigenvector becomes:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
To normalize, we compute the normalization factor:
\[
\sqrt{|\cot(\theta/2)|^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta/2)}.
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ represents a 3D spherical coordinate system, not a 2D eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect normalization and $\hbar$.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
