Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. And their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. Oh, but wait, the velocities might not directly affect the luminosity calculation, since luminosity here depends on other factors. 

Wait, the question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. I remember that the luminosity of a star (as a black body) depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and the 4π is from the surface area of the sphere.

So, the key here is to find the luminosity ratio L1/L2. Let's denote the parameters for Star_2 as R₂, T₂, and Star_1 as R₁ = 1.5 R₂, and T₁. But wait, how do we find T₁ and T₂?

The question says that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). If λ_max is the same for both stars, then T₁ must equal T₂. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T₁ = T₂. Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, let me think again. If λ_max is the same for both, then T₁ must be equal to T₂. Because if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Oh wait, but if that's the case, then the luminosity ratio would depend only on the radius. Because L is proportional to R² T^4. If T is the same, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 R₂, then (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. That would point to option A) ~2.25.

But wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength. So the peak wavelengths we observe are affected by the star's velocity. Oh, right! Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. So the star's own temperature determines the emitted wavelength, but the observed wavelength is Doppler shifted.

Wait, so the problem states that the observed wavelengths (the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest) are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both.

So, the actual emitted λ_max for each star would differ if their velocities are different. Because of the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, more accurately, the relativistic Doppler shift is λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ), but since the velocities here are 0 and 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is ~3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% of c), so non-relativistic approximation might be okay. Wait, but 700 km/s is about 0.00233c, so perhaps a non-relativistic approximation is sufficient.

The Doppler shift formula in the non-relativistic case is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c). So for Star_1, v_r is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s, so λ_obs2 ≈ λ_rest2 (1 + 700 / 3e5). Let me compute that fraction: 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333. So 1 + 0.02333 ≈ 1.02333.

Wait, but the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).

And λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, so λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But λ_rest is given by Wien's law as λ_rest = b / T.

So, λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = T2 / T1.

Because λ = b / T → λ1 = b/T1, λ2 = b/T2. So λ1/λ2 = T2/T1.

But from the Doppler shift:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).

So,

(T2 / T1) = (1 + v_r2 / c).

Wait, but let me re-express:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c) → (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c) → 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c) → T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

So T1 is T2 divided by (1 + v_r2/c). Hmm, but Star_2 has a higher velocity, so this would make T1 lower than T2? Wait, but that can't be because the observed wavelengths are the same, but Star_2 is moving away (if v_r is positive, meaning moving away from us, causing a redshift). So, Star_2's emitted light is redshifted. So, the actual emitted wavelength for Star_2 is shorter (since when moving away, the observed wavelength is longer), wait no, wait, the Doppler shift when moving away makes λ_obs longer than λ_rest. So, if Star_2 is moving away, its λ_obs is longer than λ_rest.

Wait, but we have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So, if Star_1's λ_rest is λ1, and Star_2's λ_rest is longer, but Star_2 is moving away, making its observed λ longer. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, when a star moves away from us, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So, Star_2 has v_r =700 km/s, which is moving away. So, λ_obs2 is longer than λ_rest2. Star_1 has v_r=0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, λ_rest1 must be less than λ_rest2, because λ_obs2 is λ_rest2*(1 + v_r/c). So, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r/c).

So, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But using Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c) → T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

So, T1 is T2 divided by a number greater than 1. So T1 < T2.

So, now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since R1 = 1.5 R2, that's ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / (R2^2 ) ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4).

But T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c). So, T1 = T2 * [1/(1 + 0.002333)].

So, T1^4 = T2^4 * [1/(1.002333)]^4.

So, [T1/T2]^4 = [1/(1.002333)]^4.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1.002333)]^4.

What's 1.002333^4? Let's approximate.

First, 1.002333 is approximately 1.00233. Let me compute the natural logarithm: ln(1.00233) ≈ 0.002327 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x).

So, ln(1.00233)^4 ≈ 4 * 0.002327 = 0.009308.

Then, e^0.009308 ≈ 1.00936.

So, 1.00233^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So, 1/(1.00233)^4 ≈ 1/1.00936 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2278.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. Option C is ~2.35, which is higher. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Because I might have made a mistake in the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise calculation:

v_r2 = 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So v_r2 / c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.0023333333.

So, 1 + v_r2/c = 1.0023333333.

(1.0023333333)^4 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

First, compute (1.0023333333)^2:

1.0023333333^2 = (1 + 0.0023333333)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0023333333) + (0.0023333333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000054444 ≈ 1.004672111.

Then, square that to get to the 4th power:

(1.004672111)^2 = ?

Again, using the expansion: (1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x + x², where x = 0.004672111.

So,

= 1 + 2*(0.004672111) + (0.004672111)^2

= 1 + 0.009344222 + 0.000021827

≈ 1.009366049.

So, 1.0023333333^4 ≈ 1.009366049.

So, 1/(1.009366049) ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2278.

So approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought initially that the Doppler effect wouldn't have an impact because the temperatures would adjust. But here, the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, which is the same for both stars. Hence, the actual temperatures are different. So, this introduces a factor that reduces the luminosity ratio from 2.25 to about 2.23.

So the correct answer should be D) ~2.23.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we start by using the formula for luminosity of a black body:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Substituting this into the radius ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem also states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, \( v_r = 0 \), so the observed wavelength is equal to the rest wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \). For Star_2, \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), so the observed wavelength is redshifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

Substituting \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} = 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.2278
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
