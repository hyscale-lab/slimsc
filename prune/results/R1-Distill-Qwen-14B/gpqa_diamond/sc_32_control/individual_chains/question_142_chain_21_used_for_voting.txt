Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, right, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, I think I've seen something like this before. Oh right! This looks like a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. So, the state isn't pure because it's a statistical mixture, not a superposition.

I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has a certain parametrization. A general qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So, the density matrix ρ is expressed in terms of this vector r.

Wait, the given ρ is ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me expand that. The |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (2,2). Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements as 1. Then, multiplying by ½ gives ρ as [[½, 0], [0, ½]]. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with both diagonal elements ½ and off-diagonal 0.

Now, the general form for a density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. Let me recall the Pauli matrices:

X = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, substituting into the general form, we get:

ρ = (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2

Let's compute each term. I is the identity matrix, so I/2 is [[½, 0], [0, ½]].

Then, r_x X is r_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] which gives [[0, r_x], [r_x, 0]]. Similarly, r_y Y is [[0, -i r_y], [i r_y, 0]], and r_z Z is [[r_z, 0], [0, -r_z]].

Adding all these together:

(I/2) + (r_x X)/2 + (r_y Y)/2 + (r_z Z)/2.

So the full matrix becomes:

Top-left element: ½ + (r_z * ½) → because the Z term adds r_z/2 to (1,1) and subtracts r_z/2 from (2,2).

Top-right and bottom-left elements: (r_x/2) + (-i r_y/2) from the X and Y terms.

Bottom-right element: ½ - (r_z * ½).

Wait, but the given ρ is diagonal with ½ on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. So, let's compare the two matrices.

Our given ρ is:
[[½, 0],
 [0, ½]]

The general ρ is:

Top-left: (½ + (r_z * ½))
Top-right: (r_x/2 - i r_y/2)
Bottom-left: (r_x/2 + i r_y/2)
Bottom-right: (½ - (r_z * ½))

So, setting our given ρ equal to this, let's see the conditions:

1. The off-diagonal elements must be zero. So, (r_x/2 - i r_y/2) = 0.

Which implies that r_x = 0 and r_y = 0, because r_x/2 - i r_y/2 = 0 implies r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because the real part is r_x/2 = 0, so r_x=0. The imaginary part is (- r_y)/2 = 0, so r_y=0.

2. The diagonal elements must be ½. So, (½ + (r_z/2)) = ½ and (½ - (r_z/2)) = ½.

Wait, let's compute the top-left: ½ + (r_z/2) = ½. So (r_z/2) must be zero → r_z=0.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make ρ = I/2, which is the completely mixed state. Oh, wait, that's exactly what ρ is in this problem! Because ρ is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

But wait, if r_z is zero, then the diagonal terms are ½, which is correct. But then, wait, how does this fit into the Bloch sphere? The Bloch sphere has r being a vector with magnitude ≤1. But if all components are zero, then r is the origin.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the components. Let me think again. The condition is that top-left is ½ + r_z/2 = ½ → r_z/2 must be zero, so r_z=0. Similarly, bottom-right is ½ - r_z/2 = ½, which also gives r_z=0.

So the r vector is (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0,0,0). Because r_x and r_y are zero, and r_z is zero.

Wait, but that's the origin in the Bloch sphere. The origin represents the completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because the density matrix I/2 is the state with maximum entropy, it's the completely mixed state, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the north pole, which represents the state |0⟩, but wait, no, because |0⟩ is (1,0,0) or (0,0,1)? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, the Bloch sphere parametrization is such that the state |0⟩ is at (0,0,1), and |1⟩ is at (0,0,-1), right? Because the general state is (I + r_z Z)/2 + ... So for |0⟩, the density matrix is |0⟩⟨0|, which would correspond to r_z = 1, because (I + Z)/2 = |0⟩⟨0|.

Similarly, |1⟩ is (I - Z)/2, so r_z = -1.

Wait, then for a maximally mixed state, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2 = I/2, we have r = (0,0,0), because r_z is zero, and the other components are zero.

So the position is (0,0,0), which is option C.

Let me quickly check the options:

A) r=(1,1,0) → Not sure, but probably a point on the equator.

B) (0,0,1) → That's the state |0⟩.

C) (0,0,0) → The origin, which is the maximally mixed state.

D) (1,1,1) → That's a point outside the Bloch sphere, since the sphere has radius 1.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the qubit is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. The density matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \(1/2\) and off-diagonal elements equal to zero.

For a single qubit, the Bloch sphere representation of a density matrix is given by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (X, Y, Z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector that parametrizes the state. Comparing this general form to the given \(\rho\), we find:

1. The off-diagonal elements of \(\rho\) must be zero. This implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\), as the off-diagonal terms depend on \(r_x\) and \(r_y\).
2. The diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are both \(1/2\). This implies \(r_z = 0\), as the diagonal terms depend on \(r_z\).

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. The origin represents the completely mixed state, which matches the given \(\rho\).

### Analysis of the options:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This corresponds to a point on the equator of the Bloch sphere, which does not match the given \(\rho\).
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** This corresponds to the state \(|0\rangle\), which is a pure state, not the given mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which matches the maximally mixed state \(\rho\).
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This corresponds to a point outside the Bloch sphere, which is not valid for a single qubit.

The correct answer is **C**, as the given density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.
