Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Normally, when its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. 

Hmm, the options given are A to D, and the transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is about 1448 Angstroms or 0.1448 nanometers. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. Oh wait, no, wait. Let's see: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. Oh right, that's in the UV-C range. But I don't think that's directly relevant yet.

So the key here is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower, 5500 K instead of 6000 K. So the question is about how the ratio changes when the star isn't spotted (T=6000 K) compared to when it is (T=5500 K). 

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_6000K divided by (n1/n2)_5500K. Because when the star is spotted, the ratio is lower, so the factor is greater than 1.

Wait, but wait, let's double-check that. So when the star is unspotted, temperature is higher (6000 K), and when spotted, it's 5500 K. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). But wait, because if E2 > E1, then as T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, making the ratio n1/n2 larger. Because if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T is higher, the denominator (kT) is larger, so the exponent is less negative, so the exponential is larger, making n1/n2 higher.

So if the star is hotter, the ratio n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500. 

But wait, let's get back to the ratio. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Because the Boltzmann factor for the higher level is exp(-E2/(kT)) and for the lower level is exp(-E1/(kT)), so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Because it's (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which is the same as exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ), if g1 and g2 are the same, which I think they are for this problem because they're talking about two specific levels, but the problem doesn't give g1 and g2, so maybe they are equal? Or maybe the ratio g1/g2 is a constant and doesn't affect the ratio of the ratios, so we can ignore it when taking the ratio of the two cases.

Wait, the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

Since n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Let me denote this as R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ). 

So the factor is R(6000 K) / R(5500 K) = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k *6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k*5500) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so we're left with exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k) ] (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ).

Wait, let's compute the exponent.

Let me compute the exponent part: [ (E1-E2)/(k) ] * [1/6000 - 1/5500 ].

But I don't know E1-E2. However, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the levels is given by the photon's energy: E = hc / λ.

Yes, that's correct. So E2 - E1 = hc / λ. Because when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon with energy E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So E1 - E2 = - (E2 - E1) = - hc / λ.

So substituting into the exponent, we have:

(E1-E2)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (- hc/λ) * (1/6000 -1/5500) / k.

So the exponent becomes (- hc/(λ k)) * (1/6000 - 1/5500).

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated, but let's compute this step by step.

First, compute 1/6000 - 1/5500.

1/6000 is approximately 0.0001666667.

1/5500 is approximately 0.0001818182.

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = 0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182 = -0.0000151515.

So that's negative.

So the exponent is:

(- hc/(λ k)) * (-0.0000151515) )

Which is positive. Because two negatives make a positive.

So the exponent is (hc/(λ k)) * (0.0000151515).

Compute hc/(λ k):

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

Let me compute hc/(λ k):

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ k = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = let's compute that.

1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m.

So 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 * 1.38 = approximately 1.994, and exponents are e-7 *e-23 = e-30. So 1.994e-30 J·m/K.

Wait, but hc is 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So hc/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.994e-30 J·m/K ) ) 

Wait, wait, no, because λ is in meters and hc is in J·m, and k is J/K. Let me recheck.

Wait, hc is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ is 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc/(λ) is (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = 1.372e-18 J.

Then hc/(λ k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = approximately (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 K.

1.372 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995, so approximately 9.95e4 K.

Wait, let me compute 1.372e-18 divided by 1.38e-23:

1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 9.95e4 K.

So hc/(λ k) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Now, the exponent is (9.95e4 K) * (0.0000151515) ) ≈ 9.95e4 * 1.51515e-5.

Compute that:

9.95e4 * 1.51515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.51515) ) * (1e4 * 1e-5) ) = (approx 15.066) ) * 1e-1 = approx 1.5066.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5066.

So the factor is exp(1.5066) ≈ e^1.5066.

We know that e^1 is about 2.71828.

e^0.5 is about 1.6487.

So e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, but wait, I'm approximating here. Alternatively, we can compute e^1.5066.

Alternatively, since 1.5066 is a bit more than 1.5, perhaps around 4.5.

But let's compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(5)=1.609; 4.5 is right in between.

Wait, ln(4.5) = ln(9/2) = ln(9) - ln(2) = 2.1972 - 0.6931 = 1.5041.

Oh, that's very close to our exponent of 1.5066.

So e^1.5041 = 4.5.

So e^1.5066 is a little higher than 4.5.

How much higher? Let's compute the difference.

Our exponent is 1.5066, which is 0.0025 higher than 1.5041.

The derivative of e^x is e^x, so the approximate increase is e^1.5041 * 0.0025.

e^1.5041 is 4.5.

So 4.5 * 0.0025 = 0.01125.

So e^1.5066 ≈ 4.5 + 0.01125 = 4.51125.

But wait, wait, perhaps more accurately, since the exponent is 1.5066, which is 1.5041 + 0.0025.

So e^(1.5041 + 0.0025) = e^1.5041 * e^0.0025.

e^0.0025 is approximately 1 + 0.0025 + (0.0025)^2/2 ≈ 1.002503125.

So 4.5 * 1.002503 ≈ 4.511263.

So the factor is approximately 4.51.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, option D is ~2.9, option B is ~7.8, and option A is ~1.1.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me double-check the calculation because sometimes it's easy to get the signs wrong.

Wait, the exponent was positive, which makes the ratio R(6000)/R(5500) = exp(positive number), so the ratio increases when T increases. So when the star is hotter (6000 K), the n1/n2 ratio is higher.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when it's at 5500 K, the ratio is lower. So the factor R(6k)/R(5.5k) is about 4.5. So the ratio without spots is 4.5 times higher than when it has spots.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the way the problem is phrased is that the ratio 'decreases' when the star has spots. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it's at 6000 K. So the factor is (6000K ratio)/(5500 K ratio) = 4.5.

So the answer should be C) ~4.5.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are the energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the problem does not provide \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \), we assume they are constant and cancel out when taking the ratio of the two cases.

The energy difference between the levels corresponds to the wavelength of the transition, \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). The energy difference is:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio of the populations at two temperatures, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (unspotted) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spotted), is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( E_2 - E_1 = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \), \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \times 0.00001515 \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \times 0.00001515 \approx 1.5066.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\exp(1.5066) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star is unspotted (6000 K) compared to when it is spotted (5500 K). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
