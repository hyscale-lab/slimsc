Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii are compared: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor.

Astronomers used spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the wavelength of maximum intensity for a black body is related to its temperature, right? That's Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max * T = constant. So if the lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. So Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. If lambda_max is the same, then T is the same. So both stars are at the same temperature. That's an important point.

Next, the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity refers to the component of the star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. A radial velocity of zero means Star_1 isn't moving towards or away from us in that direction. But Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. I'm not sure how radial velocity affects luminosity, but perhaps it's not directly relevant here since the question is about black body radiation and luminosity.

The astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to find the factor by which L1 is greater than L2.

Assuming both stars radiate as black bodies. Luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same temperature, T is the same for both. So the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)² multiplied by (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, the (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So why is the answer not A) ~2.25?

But wait, the problem also mentions that the mass is 1.5 times. Oh, but in the problem statement, we're told that both radii and masses are 1.5 times larger for Star_1. But in our calculation, the mass isn't directly affecting the luminosity here because we're using the black body formula, which only depends on radius and temperature. So the mass might be a red herring, or perhaps it's relevant for another part I'm missing.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the stars have the same temperature, then mass isn't directly influencing the luminosity in this case. But wait, mass might affect other things like radius or temperature. But in this problem, we're told that R is 1.5 times for Star_1, and T is same. So perhaps the masses are given but not needed for the calculation.

So perhaps the answer is 2.25, so option A.

But wait, the options don't have A as the correct answer in the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So according to my calculation, the answer should be 2.25, which is option A. But why are the other options close to that value?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed luminosity? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. If Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed wavelength might be shifted, but since the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, perhaps the Doppler effect is already accounted for in the calculation of the temperature.

Wait, let me consider that. If Star_2 is moving away (or towards) us, the observed wavelength would be shifted. But since their lambda_max are the same, that might mean that their actual temperatures, when considering the Doppler shift, are the same. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, no. Because the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So that would mean that their emitted wavelengths are the same, but perhaps the Doppler effect can affect the observed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect doesn't affect the peak wavelength of the blackbody emission because the star's movement doesn't change the intrinsic temperature as measured by the observer. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think. The peak wavelength observed is lambda_obs = lambda_emit / (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. So if Star_2 has a higher radial velocity, its observed lambda would be different. But in the problem, both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So let's model this.

For Star_1: radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s. So lambda1 = lambda_emit_1.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. So lambda2 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v2/c) assuming it's moving away. If it's moving towards, it's 1/(1 - v2/c). But the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_2's velocity is 700, but which direction? The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. Radial velocity can be positive (moving away) or negative (towards). But the problem states Star_1's radial velocity is 0, Star_2 is 700. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify direction, just that the radial velocities are 0 and 700. So we have to assume that they are moving in such a way that their observed lambda_max is the same.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So observed lambda_max for both is the same. So the observed lambda_max1 equals observed lambda_max2.

So let's write the equations for each star.

Star_1: observed lambda1 = lambda_emit1 * (1 + v1/c), but v1 is 0, so lambda1 = lambda_emit1.

Star_2: observed lambda2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

Given that lambda1 = lambda2 (same observed wavelength), so:

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's Law, lambda_emit is proportional to 1/T. So if lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2, then T1 = T2. But wait, if the observed wavelengths are same, but due to Doppler shifting, the emitted wavelengths might differ. So the actual temperatures might be different.

Wait, that's a different scenario. Let me clarify:

If the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same, but each star's own temperature determines their own lambda_emit. So:

lambda_emit1 = b / T1

lambda_emit2 = b / T2

But observed lambda_max1 is lambda_emit1 * (1 + v1/c) = same as observed lambda_max2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

So, since v1 is zero, lambda_emit1 = (lambda_emit2) * (1 + v2/c )

But lambda_emit1 = b / T1, and lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

So substituting,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

So T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but if the problem says that the observed lambda_max is same, then this equation comes into play. So the temperatures of the stars are not the same. Now I'm confused because earlier I thought they were same.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement.

"Astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

Ah, so the observed lambda_max is the same. So the emitted lambda_emit could be different because of the Doppler effect.

So that changes things. So in this case, their actual temperatures might be different. So I can't assume T1 = T2 anymore. I have to take into account the Doppler shifts.

So now, I need to account for the Doppler effect when calculating their temperatures.

So the observed lambda_max (lambda_obs) is equal to emitted lambda_emit multiplied by the Doppler factor.

For Star_1: lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 * (1 + v1/c) = lambda_emit1 because v1 is zero.

For Star_2: lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c ). Since lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2, we have lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c )

But from Wien's law, lambda_emit is b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So,

lambda_emit = b / T

So,

lambda_emit1 = (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

So this gives:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Rearranging,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but v2 is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s). Wait, 700 is much smaller than 3e5, so 700 / 3e5 is about 0.002333. So (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333

So T2 is slightly larger than T1. But wait, wait, the Doppler shift formula: if the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted, so the source's emitted wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, think about it this way: If a star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So the emitted wavelength is shorter, which means higher temperature. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength is shorter, meaning higher temperature.

But in our problem, the observed lambda_max is same for both. So for Star_1, lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs1, because its velocity is 0.

For Star_2, lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs2 / (1 + v2/c ), since v2 is positive (assuming moving away). So lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 / (1 + v2/c )

So, from Wien's Law,

lambda_emit = b / T

So,

lambda_emit1 = b / T1

lambda_emit2 = b / T2 = lambda_emit1 / (1 + v2/c )

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v2/c )

Cancel b,

1 / T2 = (1 / T1) / (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Which is consistent with my earlier conclusion. So T2 is T1 multiplied by approximately 1.002333.

So now, the temperatures are not the same. T2 is slightly higher than T1.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's said that the stars radiate as black bodies. So their luminosity is calculated using their own emitted properties, not the observed ones.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So perhaps they would compute the luminosity using the observed wavelengths, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the luminosity is an intrinsic property, so the calculation would be based on the star's actual (emitted) temperature and radius, not the observed.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the astronomers actually do. They observe the star's spectrum, which is Doppler shifted. To compute the star's actual luminosity, they need to correct for the redshift or blueshift to find the emitted wavelength, and thereby find the temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the luminosities are calculated as observed, but that doesn't make sense because the question says they computed them as black bodies.

So, let me get this straight. The astronomers observe the stars' spectra. They see that the peak wavelength is the same. Then, considering the Doppler shift, they can calculate the actual (intrinsic) temperature of each star.

So for Star_1: observed lambda1 = lambda_emit1 * (1 + v1/c )

v1 is 0, so lambda_emit1 = observed lambda1.

For Star_2: observed lambda2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v2/c ), and since observed lambda2 = observed lambda1, then lambda_emit2 = observed lambda1 / (1 + v2/c )

From Wien's law, lambda_emit is proportional to 1/T, so:

lambda_emit1 / lambda_emit2 = T2 / T1

But lambda_emit1 = observed lambda1

lambda_emit2 = observed lambda1 / (1 + v2/c )

So,

( observed lambda1 ) / ( observed lambda1 / (1 + v2/c) ) ) = T2 / T1

Simplify:

(1 + v2/c) = T2 / T1

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

So that's correct. So T2 is higher than T1.

Now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So,

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4

We have to find the ratio L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

And T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / [ T1 (1 + v2/c ) ]^4 )

Simplify:

= (2.25) * [ 1 / (1 + v2/c )^4 ] 

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c )^4

Now, v2 is 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So,

v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = approximately 0.00233333.

So,

1 + v2/c ≈ 1.00233333.

(1.00233333)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

We can approximate (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + n(n-1)x²/2 when x is small.

Here, x=0.0023333, n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2) * (0.002333)^2

Calculate each term:

1st term: 1

2nd term: 4*0.002333 = 0.009332

3rd term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 = 6 * (0.00000544) ≈ 0.00003264

So summing:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332

1.009332 + 0.00003264 ≈ 1.00936464

So approximately 1.00936.

But let's calculate it more accurately. Let me compute (1.00233333)^4 step by step.

First, compute 1.00233333 squared.

(1.00233333)^2 = (approx) 1.0046746

Then, square that again to get to the 4th power.

(1.0046746)^2 = approx 1.009367.

So, (1.00233333)^4 ≈ 1.009367.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009367 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.009367.

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009367.

Approximate:

1.009367 is about 1.00937.

So,

2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.2295

Wait, because 1.00937 * 2.229 = ?

Let me compute 1.00937 * 2.229.

1.00937 * 2 = 2.01874

1.00937 * 0.229 = approx 0.2314 (since 1.00937 * 0.2=0.20187, 1.00937 * 0.029= approx 0.02927).

So 0.20187 + 0.02927 ≈ 0.23114.

Total: 2.01874 + 0.23114 = 2.24988 ≈ 2.25. So 1.00937 * 2.229 ≈ 2.25. So 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.23.

Looking at the options, D is ~2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation step.

Wait, I computed (1 + v/c)^4 as 1.009367, so 2.25 / 1.009367 ≈ 2.2295.

Which rounds to 2.23, so D is the correct option.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radii**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Masses**: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity in this context).
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)).
4. **Radial Velocities**: \( v_{\text{rad},1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), \( v_{\text{rad},2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

### Step 1: Relating Emitted Wavelengths and Temperatures
Using Wien's law, the emitted wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]
The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v_{\text{rad}}/c)
\]
For Star_1 (\( v_{\text{rad},1} = 0 \)):
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},1}
\]
For Star_2 (\( v_{\text{rad},2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs},2} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot (1 + v_{\text{rad},2}/c)
\]
Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \), we equate the two:
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot (1 + v_{\text{rad},2}/c)
\]
Using \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T \), the temperatures are related as:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_{\text{rad},2}/c)
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substitute \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_{\text{rad},2}/c) \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 \cdot (T_1 \cdot (1 + v_{\text{rad},2}/c))^4}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1 + v_{\text{rad},2}/c)^4}
\]
Substitute \( v_{\text{rad},2}/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \):
\[
1 + v_{\text{rad},2}/c \approx 1.002333
\]
\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009367
\]
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009367} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
