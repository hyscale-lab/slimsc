Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the wave function of a particle and finding the normalization constant 'a'. 

The wave function is given as ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i. Wait, but the imaginary part is 0.5i, but when dealing with wave functions, usually the time-independent part is real, but maybe it's a complex function here. Oh wait, no, because the wave function can have a time-dependent part, but in this case, I think the given ψ is actually just the spatial part. But wait, the question is about the position measurements, so maybe the wave function is stationary. 

The problem says that when measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, the given ψ(x) is defined as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that can't be right because if the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, how does that fit in with the given function? Oh wait, maybe the given function is just the part where the wave function is non-zero, i.e., between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the expression given is valid between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "in a part of space where it can exist." So maybe the wave function is non-zero only within x=1 to x=3. So outside that, the wave function is zero. So the ψ(x) given is only valid for x between 1 and 3.

But wait, looking at the expression ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. That's a bit confusing because wave functions in stationary states are usually real (or have a time factor). Hmm, but perhaps that's part of the problem. So regardless, to find 'a', I need to normalize the wave function.

Normalizing the wave function means that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space equals 1. Since the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, I can integrate from x=1 to x=3.

So ψ(x) is a complex function: a/(sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i.

Wait, but for normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3. The modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you have a complex number as A + Bi, |A + Bi|^2 is A² + B² if A and B are real. Wait, no, more accurately, if the wave function is ψ = A + B i, then |ψ|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2. Because (A + Bi)(A* - Bi) = A² + B², since A and B are real.

So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So |ψ|² is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Let me set up the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Breaking this into two integrals:

a² * ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 * ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each part. First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 2 (since 3-1=2).

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2). Let me calculate that numerically. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a = sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is option B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Is that correct? Or should it be (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by something else?

Wait, another thought: Could the wave function be written as [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ] multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), or is it a subtraction? Because the way it's written, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i.

So when taking the modulus squared, as I did before, it's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for |ψ|². Let me double-check.

If ψ = A + B i, then |ψ|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2. So yes, in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So A² is (a²)/(1+x), and B² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the integral is correct.

So going back, a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.721. So a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we normalize the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval equals 1. 

The modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \)

For the first integral, \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \) evaluated from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), which gives:

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral, \( \int_1^3 dx = 2 \).

Substituting these results into the normalization condition:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \( a \) among the options is \( 0.85 \).
