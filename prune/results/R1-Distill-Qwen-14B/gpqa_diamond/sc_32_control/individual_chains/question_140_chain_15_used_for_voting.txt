Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius, so it's a solid at room temperature. 

Then there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and particularly, X and its analogs are used as reagents. The question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes present.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let's break it down.

First, thinking about the reaction: X reacts with liquid Y. The gas released has equal protons and neutrons. What gases have that? Let's see, H2O has H and O, but that's not the case. Wait, maybe NH3? No, because NH3 has 1 N and 3 H. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a gas where the molecule is something like CH4? No, CH4 has 6 neutrons and protons (C has 6 protons, H has 1 each). No, wait, the molecule as a whole. Oh wait, the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in total. So, for example, if it's CO2, then the molecule would have 22 protons (C:6, O:8 each, so 6 + 16 =22) and 12 + 16*2 =44 neutrons? No, wait, each atom's protons and neutrons. Hmm, maybe I got it wrong. The gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule as a whole. So total protons equals total neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's H2, but H2 has 2 H's, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming protium). That would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe NH3? No, NH3 has 14 protons (N has 7, H 1 each *3) and 14 neutrons? Wait, N has 7 protons and usually 7 neutrons (so 14). So NH3 has 14 protons (7+3) and 14 neutrons (7 from N, and 3 H have 0 each). So that's 14 each. So that's a possibility. But wait, wait, in that case, the molecule would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So yes, W could be NH3.

Alternatively, maybe CO. CO has 12 (C) + 8 (O) =20 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8. So 6+8=14. No, that's 20 protons, 14 neutrons. Not equal.

Alternatively, maybe something like C2H6O? No, maybe I should think of other possibilities. Wait, let's think of the gas that's commonly released in such reactions. For example, when metals react with acids, hydrogen gas is released. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so that won't fit.

Wait, wait, another angle: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 3 degrees Celsius, so B is a solid at room temp but melts around that. What's a solid with a melting point around 3°C? Maybe something like ice? But ice melts at 273 K (0°C). That's close. So B could be water (H2O), but wait, when you heat G and get B. Let me think.

So G is a precipitate formed when X reacts with Y. Heating G gives B. If B is H2O, then perhaps G is something like NaOH or another solid that dehydrates when heated. Hmm, not sure. Let's think again.

Wait, when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms. Heating G gives B, which is a solid melting at 277 K, which is water. So, maybe G is something like NaOH·H2O or a hydrate. But when heated, it releases water. Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate which when heated decomposes into CO2 and something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, maybe something like KMnO4 or others. But let's think about the reaction with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like ketones, which have a carbonyl group. Wait, but the reaction's product? Maybe a saponification reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a strong base. For example, NaOH. So when a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) reacts with NaOH, it would undergo saponification if it's an ester, but wait, the product would be a sodium carboxylate. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, going back to W: gas with same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of other possibilities. Ne: has 10 protons and 12 neutrons. No, that's not equal. Maybe CO? Wait, earlier thought: CO has 20 protons and 14 neutrons. No.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule of gas W has the same number of protons as neutrons. So H2O: 10 protons (H2:2, O:8) and 8 + (2*0) =8 neutrons. No. No. Wait, another approach: maybe the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the molecule as a whole.

So total protons equals total neutrons.

Examples:

- H2: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.
- O2: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so 2 O's have 16 protons and 16 neutrons). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits.

Wait, so W could be O2. But then what reaction would produce O2 gas? Maybe if Y is H2O and X is O2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe W is another diatomic gas.

Wait, another idea: What about CH4? 6 protons (C) +4 H's=10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe it's another molecule. Let's think about other possibilities. For example, N2: 14 protons, 14 neutrons (each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons; 2×7=14 each). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits. So gas W could be N2.

But how would that happen? If X is a metal reacting with an acid to produce N2 gas? Hmm, maybe if Y is a nitric acid or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkali metal reacting with something to release N2.

Wait, another angle: when metals react with water, they produce H2 gas. But if the reaction is violent, maybe it's a more reactive metal. So perhaps X is a metal like potassium or sodium, which reacts violently with water to produce H2. Then W would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which doesn't fit the protons equal to neutrons condition. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe another approach: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which is solid at 277 K. Well, 277 K is about 3°C. So B is solid (like ice) at that temperature. So when G is heated, it decomposes, releasing B (H2O). So G could be a hydrate, perhaps a copper sulfate pentahydrate or something. But then, maybe X is a metal reacting with an acid to produce a precipitate.

Wait, let me think about the reaction between a metal and an acid. If X is a metal like sodium (Na), which reacts with water (Y) to produce H2 (W), NaOH (G?), but NaOH is a strong base, maybe wouldn't precipitate. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that reacts with an acid (liquid Y) to form a salt that precipitates.

Wait, another possibility: X could be sodium metal. Sodium reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2 gas. So W is H2. But earlier, that doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition. Wait, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which doesn't fit. So maybe W isn't H2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate to produce CO2. But I'm not sure. Let's think of the precipitate G. When heated, it gives B, which is solid at 277 K. So maybe B is something else. Wait, 277 K is about 3°C, so ice is around 273 K. Close, but not exactly. Maybe B is something that has a higher melting point. Wait, maybe B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. Let me think of elements. For example, sulfur has a melting point around 315 K. Wait, maybe it's another compound.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base, perhaps it's deprotonating the keto acid, forming a carboxylate. But the product would have more oxygens. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that reacts with the acid to form a salt. Hmm.

Wait, the product has two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), and X is a base like NaOH, the product would be sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. So the product has two O atoms. That could fit.

So, if X is NaOH (sodium hydroxide), then Y would be an acid, say HCl. But no, when NaOH reacts with an acid, it produces a salt and water. But in that case, the gas W would be H2O? No, because it's a liquid. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH and Y is a salt solution that reacts with it. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. No, maybe I should focus on the isotopes part.

Wait, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes. So, let's think about possible elements in X.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, and H. The lightest is H (atomic mass ~1), the heaviest is Na (~23). So sum is 24. But 24 isn't an option. Wait, options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, maybe X isn't NaOH. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another possibility for X is potassium (K). K reacts with water to produce KOH and H2 gas. So W would be H2. But again, H2 doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition. Unless I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should look for X that has isotopes. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So maybe X has an element with multiple isotopes, like chlorine (has 35Cl and 37Cl) or something.

Wait, going back to the gas W. Suppose W is CO2. Then, the molecule would have 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8. So total neutrons: 6 + 8*2 =22. 44 protons and 22 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe W is CH4. Wait, earlier thought: 6 protons, but 6 neutrons? No. CH4 has 6 protons (from C) and 4 H's (1 each). So 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6 neutrons. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule with one atom. Like O3? No, O3 has 16 protons, 16 neutrons? Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so 3 O's would have 24 protons and 24 neutrons. So O3 would have 24 each. That fits. So W could be O3.

But how would that happen? Ozone is formed in certain reactions. Maybe from the decomposition of peroxides or something. Not sure, but let's consider that.

So, if W is O3, then in the reaction between X and Y, O3 is released. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions. Let me think of other possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe W is a molecule of another element. For example, Cl2? Cl has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (for 35Cl). So Cl2 would have 34 protons and 36 neutrons (assuming each Cl is 35Cl). Not equal. Or if it's 37Cl, then 37*2=74 protons and 76 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe W is something else. Let's think of noble gases. For example, Argon has 18 protons and 22 neutrons (if it's 40Ar). So total protons:18, neutrons:22. Not equal. So no.

Wait, maybe I should think of other possible gases. Let me think of the possible molecules where total protons equal total neutrons.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of common gases and their total protons and neutrons.

- H2: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.
- He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes, 2 each. So He is a possibility. But He is a noble gas; when does a reaction release He? Not common, I think.
- O2: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So 2 O's: 16 each. Yes, that fits.
- N2: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes.

So W could be O2 or N2. Let's think about what reaction would produce O2 or N2 gas.

If X is a metal reacting with an acid (like H2SO4?), perhaps producing O2. Alternatively, if Y is a solution of a compound that decomposes upon reaction with X to release O2 or N2.

Wait, if X is a metal and Y is a nitric acid solution, then the reaction might produce N2O or NO, but not N2. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution that reacts to produce O2, like if X is a strong reducing agent.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the other parts again. The product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a strong base, like KOH, when it reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), it would form a salt with two O's in the carboxylate ion.

Wait, but the product in that case would have more than two O's, depending on the acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like acetone (which is a ketone, but not an acid). Wait, no, a keto acid is an acid with a keto group, like acetoacetic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should think about X's isotopes. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So in X, one of the elements has a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl. So if X contains Cl, then the heavier isotope is 37Cl.

Which brings me back to thinking that X might be something like NaCl? No, NaCl is a salt. Wait, or maybe X is HCl, but that's a gas. Or perhaps X is a compound with multiple elements, such as KClO3 or something.

Wait, but earlier I was thinking X is NaOH. Let's consider that again. NaOH has Na, O, H. The isotopes would be for Na (23, 24, 25?), O (16, 17, 18), and H (1). So if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (sum of isotopes: 1). The heaviest is Na: 23. So sum is 24. But the options don't have 24. So perhaps X isn't NaOH.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes. So for each element present in X, sum their isotopic masses (like all H isotopes sum to about 1*number, O isotopes sum to 16*number, etc.).

Wait, if X has elements A and B, the lightest is A (say, H with mass 1), the heaviest is B (say, Cl with mass 35 and 37). So for Cl, the isotopes would contribute 35 and 37, so sum would be 72 (assuming one atom of each). Wait, but the problem says if multiple instances exist, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. So for each element in X, sum all their isotopes' masses.

Wait, but the question says "lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So it's about the elements, not the atoms. So for each element present, find the lightest and heaviest, then sum their atomic masses.

Wait, no. Let me read again: "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X".

So, within X, find the lightest element (by atomic number) and the heaviest element (by atomic number), then sum their atomic masses.

Wait, but the question also says: "considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

So perhaps it's for each element in X, sum all the isotopes present, then pick the lightest and heaviest elements (by atomic number) in X, sum their total isotopic masses.

Hmm. So for example, if X is NaOH, then elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not in options.

But if X is something else, say, KCl. Then elements K (~39) and Cl (~35 and 37). So the lightest is Cl (35?), but wait, K is heavier than Cl. So the lightest element is Cl (atomic number 17), heaviest is K (19). Wait, no, K is heavier than Cl. So lightest element is Cl, heaviest is K.

Wait, but K's atomic mass is about 39, Cl's is about 35.5. So sum would be 35.5 + 39 = 74.5. But the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X contains elements like C and O. Wait, let's think of another possibility.

Wait, going back to the reaction: when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of about 277 K. So perhaps B is something like sodium carbonate decahydrate, but no, that's a higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium hydroxide, but that's a solid at room temp.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe B is a salt that's a solid but has a lower melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound. Wait, perhaps B is a metal, but that's less likely.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a reagent that adds an oxygen. For example, KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, often used in organic reactions. When it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it oxidizes it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, X could be a metal that when reacts with a keto acid forms a salt with two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a metal like Mg, which reacts with a strong acid to produce H2 gas. But then W is H2, which doesn't fit the protons and neutrons condition.

Another approach: Maybe the gas W is CO. Wait, CO has 12 (C) + 8 (O) =20 protons, and 6 (C's neutrons) + 8 (O's neutrons) =14. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what about CO2? As before, 44 protons, 22 neutrons. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Another idea: Maybe the gas is something like Ne (neon). Ne is a noble gas, so it's monoatomic. Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons (for 20Ne). So protons equal neutrons. So W could be Ne. But I don't know of a common reaction that releases Ne gas. Unlikely.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about X's properties. It's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and particularly its analogs. So X may be something like NaOH, KOH, or another strong base. Or perhaps it's a halide like NaCl, but that's more of a salt.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a product with two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming a carboxylate. The product would have more oxygens, but maybe the question is about the number of O atoms in the product molecule. For example, if the product is the conjugate base (like acetate), it has two O's in the carboxylate group.

So, the product would have two O atoms, which makes sense. So X is a base like NaOH or KOH.

So if X is NaOH, then the elements in X are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (~1), heaviest Na (~23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option. So perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is potassium permanganate (KMnO4). But that's a strong oxidizing agent. Let's see: when KMnO4 reacts with something like a reducing agent, it could release O2 gas. So W would be O2. Which has 16×2=32 protons and 16×2=32 neutrons. That fits the condition (equal protons and neutrons). So W is O2.

So in this case, X is KMnO4. Let's see the reaction: KMnO4 reacts with an acid, say HCl, under certain conditions to produce MnCl2, O2, KCl, and H2O. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

But if X is KMnO4, then the elements present are K, Mn, O. The lightest element is K (39?), no, wait, K is 19th element with atomic mass ~39. Mn is 25th, atomic mass ~55. O is 8th, atomic mass ~16. So the lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Mn (55). Sum is 16+55=71, which isn't an option. So perhaps X isn't KMnO4.

Wait, another possibility: X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like sodium sulfate decahydrate, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. So if B is water (melting at 273 K), then perhaps G is a hydrate. For example, copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) when heated gives CuSO4 and water. So B would be H2O. If G is a hydrate, then X must be a substance that reacts with Y to form a hydrate.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate that, when heated, decomposes into CO2 and another product. For example, Na2CO3·10H2O heated gives Na2CO3 and H2O. But then B would be H2O again.

Wait, if B is H2O, then G is a hydrate. So, when X reacts with Y, it forms a hydrate. So perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a solution to form a hydroxide, which is then dehydrated to form a hydrate.

Wait, but then when you heat the hydrate, you get the anhydrous form and H2O. So, perhaps X is a metal, Y is a water solution, reaction forms a hydroxide, which is a precipitate. Then, upon heating, the hydroxide loses water to form a metal oxide and release H2O (B). But in that case, the metal oxide would be B? Wait, no, because the metal oxide is solid but wouldn't be H2O.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of X's isotopes again. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So one of the elements in X has a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl, so if X has Cl, then perhaps it's NaCl, KCl, etc.

If X is KCl, then elements are K and Cl. K has a mass around 39, Cl around 35.5. So the lightest element is Cl (35.5), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 35.5 +39=74.5. Again, not in the options.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound that includes hydrogen and oxygen, like H2O. But H2O is a liquid, so perhaps Y is another substance. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing hydrogen and another element with a heavy isotope, like deuterium. But deuterium is a heavier isotope of H. So if X is H2O with some D, then the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not in the options.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a compound like NH3. Then, the elements are N and H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest N (14). Sum is 15. Not in options.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the options given: 35, 25, 31, 29. Those are all in the 20s and 30s. So perhaps the sum is around 35, which is option A.

Wait, another approach: what if X is a compound that contains two elements, one light and one heavier. For example, something with H and O. H is 1, O is 16. Sum is 17. Not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains elements with atomic masses adding up to one of the options. For example, if X contains C (12) and O (16), sum is 28. Not an option. Wait, option D is 29, option C is 31.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound containing Cl and another element. Cl has an average atomic mass of about 35.5. So if X has Cl and H, then H is 1, Cl 35.5. Sum is 36.5. Not an option. But option A is 35, which is close.

Wait, but the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X has Cl and another element, say, K, then K is 39, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 74.5, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to think of the possible answers and work backwards.

Option A: 35. So the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses is 35. Possible pairs: 1 (H) + 34 (Se), but that's not likely. Or 15 (P) + 20 (Ca?), no. Wait, 16 (O) + 19 (K) is 35. So if X contains O and K, sum is 16+39=55. Not matching.

Wait, 17 (Cl) and 18 (Ar). No, that's 35. But X is a substance, so these elements would need to be part of the same compound. Hmm, maybe X is KCl. K is ~39, Cl ~35.5. So 39+35.5=74.5, which isn't 35.

Wait, another possibility: X contains C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28. Not in options. Alternatively, if X contains N (14) and O (16), sum is 30. Close to option C (31), but not quite.

Wait, perhaps X contains F (19) and O (16). 19+16=35. That matches option A. So if X contains F and O, then the sum is 35.

So what substances contain F and O? Fluorine compounds, like NaF or something else. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry, so perhaps it's something like TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride), but that's more advanced.

Alternatively, X could be a compound like HFO (hexafluoropentane?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something like a fluoroalkane.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a fluorinated compound, like TFE (tetrafluoroethylene), but I'm not sure about the reaction details.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a simple fluoride, like NaF. Then, when NaF reacts with something (maybe an acid), it produces HF gas. But HF is a liquid under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is CaF2, which reacts with an acid to produce Ca^2+ and 2 F^- and H2 gas? No, CaF2 is insoluble in most acids except HCl, but I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces F2 gas, but that's a strong oxidizer and not commonly produced in such reactions.

Wait, but if X contains F and O, and the sum is 19 +16=35, then that's option A. So perhaps the correct answer is A)35.

But I'm not entirely sure about the rest of the reaction details, but given the options, this seems plausible.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to release gas W (with equal protons and neutrons in the molecule), forms a precipitate G, and produces a solid B with a melting point near 277 K. Additionally, X reacts with a keto acid to produce a product containing two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons) or N₂ (14 protons, 14 neutrons). These are plausible based on the reaction conditions.

2. **Precipitate G and Solid B**: G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point near 277 K, suggesting it could be water (H₂O), as ice melts at 273 K. This aligns with the decomposition of a hydrate or hydroxide.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X could be a base or a compound that introduces oxygen atoms, such as NaOH or KOH.

4. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, chlorine (Cl) has isotopes like \(^{35}\text{Cl}\) and \(^{37}\text{Cl}\), or fluorine (F) has isotopes like \(^{19}\text{F}\).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The lightest and heaviest elements in X must be identified, and their atomic masses summed. For example:
   - If X contains fluorine (F, atomic mass ~19) and oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16), the sum is \(19 + 16 = 35\).
   - Other combinations (e.g., Cl and K) yield sums not matching the options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible explanation is that X contains fluorine and oxygen. The cumulative atomic masses of these elements are 19 (F) and 16 (O), respectively, summing to 35. This matches option A.

Answer: A
