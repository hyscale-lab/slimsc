Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside the interval x=1 to x=3. So they want to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm. So the wave function is a function of x, right? And in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is given by the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, that means the wave function should be zero outside this region. But wait, the wave function given doesn't have a form that naturally makes it zero outside a certain range. Oh, maybe because the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given expression is only valid between 1 and 3.

Wait, no, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But in reality, the wave function must be zero outside the region where the particle can exist. So perhaps the given expression is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the way the question is phrased, it says the wave function is described as that expression in the region where the particle can exist. So the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3.

But wait, the wave function given is complex: has a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5i). So the wave function ψ(x) is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i, but only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or is that the case? Wait, the problem states that the wave function is described as that in the part of space where the particle can exist, which is x between 1 and 3. So that's the region where ψ(x) is non-zero.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of |ψ|^2 dx must equal 1. Because the total probability must be 1.

So the plan is to calculate the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3, set it equal to 1, and solve for 'a'.

Let me write down the wave function:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, for x between 1 and 3.

So the absolute square is ψ*(x) ψ(x). Let's compute that.

ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate. So ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying ψ* and ψ:

|ψ|² = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + [0.5]² + i terms, but wait, when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), you get (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25, because the imaginary parts cancel out (they become real upon multiplication).

Wait, let me calculate it properly.

( a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i ) * ( a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i ) = (a/sqrt(1+x))² - (0.5i)^2.

Because (x - y)(x + y) = x² - y². Here, x is a/sqrt(1+x), and y is 0.5i.

So, computing this:

= (a²)/(1+x) ) - ( (0.5i)^2 )

But i squared is -1, so (0.5i)^2 = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

So the term becomes:

= (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right. Because (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 * i² = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25. So the overall expression is (a²)/(1+x) ) - ( -0.25 ) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but that seems a bit strange because the absolute square shouldn't have an imaginary component, which it doesn't, but the cross terms should cancel. Hmm, maybe I should expand it.

Wait, expanding ψ*(x) * ψ(x):

= (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (0.5i) + (-0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) + (-0.5i)(0.5i).

Simplify each term:

First term: a²/(1+x).

Second term: 0.5 a i / sqrt(1+x).

Third term: -0.5 a i / sqrt(1+x). So this cancels the second term.

Fourth term: (-0.5i)(0.5i) = (-0.25)i² = (-0.25)(-1) = 0.25.

So total is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Okay, so that's correct. So |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's a bit unusual because normally when you have a wave function, the absolute square is real and positive, which this is.

Now, the normalization condition is that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So,

∫_{1}^{3} [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫_{1}^{3} 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫_{1}^{3} dx = 1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.

Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2.

Putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Take the square root to find a:

a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )

Let me calculate this numerically.

First, compute ln(2). ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then, sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options: option B is 0.85, so that's close.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

0.5 is 0.5.

ln(2)=0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.72134752.

sqrt(0.72134752) ≈ Let's compute sqrt(0.72134752):

Well, 0.85^2 is 0.7225. Hmm, that's very close.

Wait, 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Our value is approximately 0.72134752. So it's a bit less than 0.85.

Wait, but 0.849^2 is (0.85 - 0.001)^2 = approx 0.7225 - 2*0.85*0.001 + (0.001)^2 ≈ 0.7225 - 0.0017 ≈ 0.7208.

Which is a bit higher than our target of 0.7213. Wait, 0.849^2 is about 0.7208, which is lower than 0.7213. Hmm.

Wait, let me compute 0.849^2:

0.849 × 0.849

= (0.8 + 0.049)^2 = 0.8^2 + 2 *0.8*0.049 + 0.049^2

= 0.64 + 0.0784 + 0.002401 = 0.64 + 0.0784 = 0.7184 + 0.002401 = 0.720801.

So 0.849^2 is about 0.720801.

The target is 0.72134752. So the square root is a bit more than 0.849.

Let me compute 0.8495^2:

0.8495 × 0.8495.

Let me compute 0.85^2 = 0.7225.

But 0.8495 is 0.85 - 0.0005.

So (0.85 - 0.0005)^2 = 0.7225 - 2 * 0.85 * 0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

= 0.7225 - 0.00085 + 0.00000025.

So approximately 0.7225 - 0.00085 = 0.72165.

Which is slightly more than our target 0.72134752.

So a is somewhere between 0.849 and 0.8495.

But the options don't have that precise a value. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.1

B) 0.85

C) 0.35

D) 0.6.

So 0.85 is option B. And our calculation shows it's approximately 0.849, which is about 0.85. So likely, the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that can't be right because in a wave function, the real and imaginary parts might be functions, but in this case, the real part is a function of x, and the imaginary part is a constant. But wait, is that possible?

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can have both real and imaginary parts, but the imaginary part can be a function of x as well. So in this case, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + ( -0.5i ), which as a function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i.

Wait, but that's a bit unusual because the imaginary part is a constant, not a function. So when we compute the absolute square, as I did, I think that's correct.

Wait, but in that case, the |psi(x)|^2 would be (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25, as I found. So the integral is as I did.

So the calculation seems correct. Then, the value of a is approximately 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), which is valid between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval equals 1. 

The absolute square of the wave function is calculated as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
   \]

Substituting these results back, we get:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213, \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest value to \( 0.849 \) among the options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.

**Answer: B**
