Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what's the geometrical position exactly referring to here?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh wait, I think I recognize this form. That looks like the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because each of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are equally weighted with probabilities 1/2 each. So this state isn't pure; it's a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices map to geometrical points. I remember something about the Bloch sphere. Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and it's represented as a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for mixed states, you need to represent them inside the sphere.

Wait, how is the density matrix mapped to coordinates on or inside the Bloch sphere? I think the general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three-dimensional space. So the vector r determines the position inside the Bloch sphere.

Let me write that out. The standard parametrization is:
ρ = (I + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)) / 2.

So if I can rewrite the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 1 in (2,2) and 0 elsewhere. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So our ρ is (I)/2.

Wait wait, so ρ = I/2. Let me plug that into the parametrization. So I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. So each component of r must be zero. So r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but some people might confuse the Bloch sphere representation. Let me just double-check. For the completely mixed state, which ρ = I/2 is, the density matrix is maximally mixed, so its representation is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. So yes, r is (0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single-qubit density matrix, it can be expressed in the form:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space. The position \(\mathbf{r}\) corresponds to the coordinates of the density matrix in the Bloch sphere.

For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form \(\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), it is evident that the term \(\frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\) must vanish, which implies \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
