Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's all about. Hmm, the question involves an electron's state and some matrix operator. I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional, so I guess I need to normalize it. Right, because the sum of the probabilities should be 1.

So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator. Let me write it out: |alpha> = A*(1+i)|up> + A*(2-i)|down>, where A is the normalization constant. Wait, no, actually, the question says it's proportional, so perhaps I should find A such that the norm is 1.

The norm squared is |A|² times (|(1+i)|² + |(2-i)|²). Let's compute that. |1+i|² is (1² + 1²) = 2. |2 -i|² is (2² + (-1)²) = 4 +1=5. So the total is 2 +5=7. So |A|² *7 =1 → |A|=1/sqrt(7). Since A is a normalization factor, it's 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm, but wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So the operator is acting on a two-level system. So this must be a spin operator, probably for the x or y component, but let me think.

Wait, the Pauli matrices, like sigma_x and sigma_y, have similar structures. Sigma x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and sigma z is diagonal. The operator here seems similar to (hbar/2) times the sigma_x matrix. Because sigma_x has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So this operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So it's the spin-x operator multiplied by hbar/2, which is the usual scaling for spin-1/2 systems.

Wait, but the operator's eigenstates would be the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x |+x> = +1 |+x>, and similarly for |-x>.

Wait, but in this problem, we're given a state, and we need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator. So the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z. So perhaps we need to expand |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator, which are the eigenstates of sigma_x.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2, so its eigenvalues would be ±hbar/2, not the usual ±1. But regardless, the method for finding probabilities would involve expressing |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of this operator.

So to find the probabilities, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. The state |alpha> is a vector in the spin space. The operator has a matrix which is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates are the ones I mentioned, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me denote these as |+x> and |-x>.

So I need to find the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>, then square their magnitudes to get the probabilities.

But wait, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Expressed as a column vector, that would be:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Similarly, |+x> is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T, and |-x> is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is ( [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] ) multiplied by the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, but in the Dirac notation, the inner product is <bra|ket>, so it should be the conjugate transpose. Oh right, so |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so < +x | is ( <up| + <down| )/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > = [ 1/sqrt(2) , 1/sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, no, the inner product is ( (1/sqrt(2)) * <up| + (1/sqrt(2)) * <down| ) acting on alpha. So it's:

(1/sqrt(2)) * ( <up|alpha> ) + (1/sqrt(2)) * ( <down|alpha> )

But <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (1/sqrt(2)) * ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

Factor out 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)):

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14)) )

Simplify numerator:

1 + i + 2 -i = 3. So 3 / sqrt(14) → sqrt(3^2) = 3.

Wait, 3 / sqrt(14) is the inner product. So the probability is the squared magnitude of this, which is (3^2)/(14) = 9/14.

Wait, hold on, that can't be right because 9/14 is about 0.64, and the other option would be 5/14 ≈0.36. Let me check the math again.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recompute the inner product.

Compute < +x | alpha >:

= (1/sqrt(2)) * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (1/sqrt(2)) * ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

= [3 ] / sqrt(14)

So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> is < -x | alpha >. Let's compute that.

< -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) < up| alpha> + ( (-1)/sqrt(2) ) < down | alpha>

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + [ (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(14):

[ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(14)

Compute numerator:

1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i )

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, probabilities can't be negative, so 5/14 is about 0.357. So the two probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357. So looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. But let's check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

So that would match our calculated probabilities. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the operator. Because I assumed the operator is sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2, but maybe the operator is different.

Wait, wait, the operator A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So that's exactly (hbar/2) times sigma_x, right? Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes. So the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

So when you measure this operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1, so the operator's eigenvalues are ±(hbar/2).

So when you measure this operator, you'll get either +hbar/2 or -hbar/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14 respectively.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The inner product gives the amplitude for the eigenstate, so the probability is the square of the amplitude. So the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is |amplitude for |+x>|^2 =9/14≈0.643, and for -hbar/2 is 5/14≈0.357.

So that's the probabilities. So the options check if these match.

Looking at option A: 0.64 and 0.36. That's pretty close.

Now, the average value of the operator. The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>, where A is the operator.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Wait, sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. So perhaps it's easier to compute it using the vector representation.

Alternatively, the expectation value can be computed as the sum over the eigenvalues times their probabilities.

Because the operator has two eigenvalues: +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14.

So the average value is ( (hbar/2)*(9/14) ) + ( (-hbar/2)*(5/14) ) )

= (hbar/2) * (9/14 -5/14 )

= (hbar/2) * (4/14)

= (hbar/2) * (2/7) )

= hbar/(7)

So the average is hbar/7. Which matches option A's third value.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the average value can be found using the state's components.

Another way: The expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed as a matrix, A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * <alpha| [ [0,1],[1,0] ] |alpha>

Which is (hbar/2) [ (a*d' + b*c') + (a'*d + b'*c) ) ] where the state is [a; b], and a', b' are their conjugates.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as the product of the conjugate of the state vector and the matrix.

The state vector is:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

The conjugate transpose is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying by the matrix:

[ [0, 1], [1,0] ]:

So the product is:

First element: 0*(1-i)/sqrt(7) + 1*(2+i)/sqrt(7) → (2+i)/sqrt(7)
Second element: 1*(1-i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2+i)/sqrt(7) → (1-i)/sqrt(7)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake.

Actually, when you multiply the conjugate transpose (row vector) with the matrix, you get a row vector. Then you multiply that with the original state (column vector) to get the inner product.

Let me proceed step by step.

So, the conjugate transpose of the state is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiply this by the matrix A_ij = [[0,1],[1,0]]:

The first element of the resulting row vector is (1-i)*0 + (2+i)*1 → (2+i), all divided by sqrt(7) because each term in the conjugate was divided by sqrt(7).

Wait, no, because each element in the conjugate is (1-i)/sqrt(7) and (2+i)/sqrt(7). So when multiplied by the matrix, each element is [ (1-i)*0 + (2+i)*1 ] / sqrt(7) → (2+i)/sqrt(7) 

The second element is [ (1-i)*1 + (2+i)*0 ] / sqrt(7) → (1-i)/sqrt(7)

So the resulting row vector after the matrix multiplication is [ (2+i)/sqrt(7) , (1-i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, multiply this with the original state vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, the inner product is:

[ (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) ] * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out 1/7:

( (2+i)(1+i) + (1-i)(2-i) ) /7

Let me compute each term.

First term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i + (-1) → 1 +3i.

Second term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

So adding the two terms: [1+3i] + [1-3i] = 2.

So the inner product is 2/7.

Multiply by (hbar/2) because the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches what I got earlier. So the average value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.643) and 5/14 (≈0.357), and the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

So this matches. So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm of the state is computed as:

\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalization constant is \( A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

The operator in question has the matrix representation:

\[
A_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & \text{if } i \neq j, \\
0 & \text{if } i = j.
\end{cases}
\]

This corresponds to the operator \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli-X matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the inner products \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \) and \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):

1. **Inner product with \( |+x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle + \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right).
\]

Substituting \( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \):

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643.
\]

2. **Inner product with \( |-x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle - \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle \right).
\]

Substituting \( \langle \uparrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow|\alpha\rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \):

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Next, we compute the average value of the operator \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The expectation value is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha| \sigma_x |\alpha\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle +x| \sigma_x |+x\rangle P(+x) + \langle -x| \sigma_x |-x\rangle P(-x).
\]

Since \( \sigma_x |+x\rangle = |+x\rangle \) and \( \sigma_x |-x\rangle = -|-x\rangle \), we have:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (+1)P(+x) + (-1)P(-x) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:

- Probabilities: \( P(+x) \approx 0.643 \), \( P(-x) \approx 0.357 \).
- Average value: \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

These match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
