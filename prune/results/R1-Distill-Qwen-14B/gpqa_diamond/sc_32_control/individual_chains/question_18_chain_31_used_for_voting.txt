Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I remember that in stellar abundances, the brackets [X/Y] represent the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms compared to the Sun. Oh right, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(N_X / N_Y) - log10(N_X/Sun / N_Y/Sun). Wait, no, actually, I think it's [X/Y] = log(N_X / N_Y) - log(N_X,Sun / N_Y,Sun). Or maybe it's [X/Y] = log10(N_X / N_Y) - log10(N_X,☉ / N_Y,☉), where ☉ is the Sun's value. 

So the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here; maybe it's just a distraction. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. 

The given values are various abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Oh, wait, H is hydrogen, so [Fe/H] is the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun. So [Fe/H]=0 means that Star_1 has the same iron abundance as the Sun? Because if the Sun has [Fe/H]=0 by definition.

Wait, the question also states that the photospheric composition of the Sun is given. For the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Let me calculate that. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Wait, but wait, I think I might have confused the notation. Oh wait, the standard notation for solar abundances is often given as 12 + log (n_X / n_H), where n_X is the number density of element X. So for the Sun, [Fe/H] = 0, meaning nFe/nH is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, let me get this straight. [X/Y] is defined as log10 (nX/nY) - log10 (nX,☉ / nY,☉) ), which is the same as log10 ( (nX/nY) / (nX,☉ / nY,☉) ) ), which is log10( (nX/nY) * (nY,☉ / nX,☉) ) ), so [X/Y] = log10( (nX * nY,☉) / (nY * nX,☉) ) ). Hmm, not sure if I'm getting that right.

But let's focus on the given data. 

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/Fe)_☉ ) ) = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/Fe)_☉.

And [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe,nH)_☉ → same as the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_☉.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_☉.

So I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, the ratio is nSi,1 / nSi,2? Or the other way around? The question says, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So probably nSi,1 / nSi,2.

But how do I find this ratio using the given data.

Wait, let's think about each star's silicon abundance relative to hydrogen. Because the ratio nSi,1 / nSi,2 can be expressed in terms of their Si/H ratios.

Because nSi,1 / nSi,2 = (nSi,1 / nH,1) * (nH,2 / nSi,2). Wait, no, that's not directly helpful. Let me think again. Alternatively, (nSi,1 / nH,1) divided by (nSi,2 / nH,2) would give (nSi,1 / nH,1) * (nH,2 / nSi,2) ) → which is (nSi,1 nH,2) / (nH,1 nSi,2) ). Not sure if that helps. Or perhaps I can express each star's [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], but since [Fe/H] is zero for Star_1, and [Fe/H] for Star_2 isn't given. Wait, Star_2 doesn't have [Fe/H] given, but only [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H].

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_☉. So for Star_1, using [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_☉ ) = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_☉.

But (nFe)_1 is same as (nFe)_☉ because [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So (nSi)_1 = (nFe)_1 * (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nFe)_☉ * 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_☉ )? Wait, no. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ / nFe_☉).

But since [Fe/H]_1 =0 → (nFe_1 / nH_1 ) = (nFe_☉ / nH_☉ ). So nFe_1 = (nFe_☉ / nH_☉ ) * nH_1. Similarly, for the Sun, nFe_☉ is a constant.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express nSi_1 / nH_1 and nSi_2 / nH_2, then take their ratio.

So for Star_1:

nSi_1 / nH_1 = [ (nSi_1 / nFe_1) * (nFe_1 / nH_1) ) ] = [ (nSi_1 / nFe_1) ] * [ (nFe_1 / nH_1) ]

We know that [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ / nFe_☉ )

And [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_☉ / nH_☉.

So:

nSi_1 /nH_1 = (10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ /nFe_☉ )) * (nFe_☉ /nH_☉ ) )

Simplify:

= 10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ )

So nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ )

Similarly, for Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg_2 /nSi_2 =10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ )

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 /nH_2= nMg_☉ /nH_☉ → nMg_2 = (nMg_☉ /nH_☉ ) *nH_2.

Hmm, but how to relate this to nSi_2. Let's see.

We can express nSi_2 in terms of nMg_2 and the [Mg/Si] ratio.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ )

So nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ ) )

But nMg_2 = (nMg_☉ /nH_☉ ) *nH_2.

Wait, but I don't know nH_2 or nH_1. However, in the photosphere, the total number of hydrogen atoms (nH) is often used as a reference. But in this problem, are we assuming that the hydrogen content is the same for both stars? No, because the problem doesn't state that. So we can't directly compare nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 in terms of their abundances relative to hydrogen.

Because, nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2 )

But I don't know nH_1 or nH_2. But wait, if the two stars have different masses, maybe their surface gravities are different, affecting the line abundances? But the problem says to assume LTE and use the EW method, which I think gives the same elemental abundances regardless of surface gravity because it's in LTE. Or maybe not, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same for both, but that's an assumption not stated in the problem. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the ratio of the silicon number densities in the photospheres, independent of hydrogen. So perhaps I can find (nSi_1 / nSi_2) = (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2 ) → Wait, that's complicating things.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's find for each star, the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen, then take the ratio.

So for Star_1:

nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ )

And for Star_2:

We have [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_☉ /nH_☉.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ )

So from Star_2's [Mg/Si], we can express nSi_2 in terms of nMg_2 and Sun's ratio.

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ ) )

But nMg_2 = (nMg_☉ / nH_☉ ) *nH_2.

So substitute:

nSi_2 = ( (nMg_☉ /nH_☉ ) *nH_2 ) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

nSi_2 = (nMg_☉ * nH_2 ) / (nH_☉ ) ) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ ) )

The nMg_☉ cancels out:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_☉ ) * (nSi_☉ ) / (10^0.3 * nH_☉ )

Wait, perhaps I should write it differently.

Let me think: nSi_2 = [nMg_2 / (10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ )) ]

But nMg_2 = (nMg_☉ /nH_☉ ) *nH_2.

So substitution:

nSi_2 = ( (nMg_☉ *nH_2 )/(nH_☉ )) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ ) )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 * nMg_☉ )/(nH_☉ ) * (nSi_☉ ) / (10^0.3 * nMg_☉ )

Cancel nMg_☉:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 * nSi_☉ )/(nH_☉ *10^0.3 )

= (nH_2 /nH_☉ ) * (nSi_☉ /10^0.3 )

Wait, but nH_2 is the number of hydrogen atoms in Star_2. I don't know how it compares to Star_1's nH_1. Unless, wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the overall composition of the stars except for the abundances given. So I can't directly relate nH_1 and nH_2.

So, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_☉/nH_☉. And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 (nSi_☉ /nFe_☉ ). So combining, nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1)*(nFe_1/nH_1) = 10^0.3 (nSi_☉/nFe_☉) * (nFe_☉ /nH_☉ ) ) = 10^0.3 (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ ).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_☉/nH_☉.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^0.3 (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ )

So, rearranged, nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ )) )

But nMg_2 = (nMg_☉ /nH_☉ ) nH_2.

So, substitute:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_☉ /nH_☉ ) nH_2 ] / [10^0.3 (nMg_☉ /nSi_☉ ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

nSi_2 = [ nMg_☉ nH_2 / (nH_☉) ] * [ nSi_☉ / (10^0.3 nMg_☉ ) ) ]

nMg_☉ cancels:

= [ nH_2 / nH_☉ ] * [ nSi_☉ / (10^0.3 ) ]

So, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_☉ )/(10^0.3 nH_☉ )

Wait, no, the expression is nSi_2 = [nH_2 * nSi_☉ ] / [nH_☉ * 10^0.3 ]

So, nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_☉ )/(nH_☉ *10^0.3 )

But from Star_1, nSi_1/nH_1 =10^0.3 (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ )

So, now, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [10^0.3 (nSi_☉/nH_☉ ) ] / [ (nSi_☉ )/(nH_☉ *10^0.3 ) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me compute (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) → this would be (nSi_1 nH_2 ) / (nH_1 nSi_2 )

But I'm interested in (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ), which is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2 ). Hmm, perhaps it's getting too tangled.

Wait, let's compute (nSi_1/nH_1 ) divided by (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) ] / [ (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ]

From earlier:

(nSi_1/nH_1 ) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ )

(nSi_2/nH_2 ) = (nSi_☉ ) / (nH_☉ *10^0.3 )

So, their ratio is:

[10^0.3 (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ ) ] / [ (nSi_☉ )/(nH_☉ 10^0.3 ) ) ] 

= [10^0.3 * (nSi_☉ /nH_☉ ) ] * [ (nH_☉ 10^0.3 ) / nSi_☉ ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (nH_☉ /nH_☉ ) * (nSi_☉ /nSi_☉ )

= 10^(0.3+0.3) * 1 * 1

=10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, approximately 4.

So, (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ≈ 4.

Which means nSi_1 /nH_1 = 4 * (nSi_2 /nH_2 )

So, nSi_1 =4 * (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) *nH_1.

Wait, but that still leaves me with the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

Which is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ) * (nH_2/nH_1 )

Wait, wait, I think I messed up. Let me write:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nSi_1 /nH_1) * (nH_2 /nH_1) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2 )

No, that's not right. Let me think again.

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nSi_1 /nH_1) * (nH_2 /nH_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ) * (nH_1 /nSi_2 )

Wait, maybe it's better to write:

nSi_1 = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) *nH_1

nSi_2 = (nSi_2/nH_2 ) *nH_2

So, nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) *nH_1 ] / [ (nSi_2/nH_2 ) *nH_2 ]

= [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ] * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

We found earlier that [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ] ≈4.

So, nSi_1/nSi_2 =4 * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, I can't proceed. Unless there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star's photosphere is the same? The problem doesn't say so, but maybe it's a necessary assumption for this problem. If so, then nH_1 =nH_2, and the ratio would be 4 *1 =4. Which would correspond to option A (~3.9), close to 4.

But I'm not sure if I can assume that. The question doesn't mention anything about the stars' sizes or surface gravities. However, the problem says to use the EW method under LTE, which I think gives the same number density regardless of surface gravity, so maybe surface gravity isn't a factor here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio would just be 10^0.3 / (10^-0.3 ) =10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is about 4. So the options include A) ~3.9.

Wait, but wait, the [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, which I think would affect the ratio. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in handling the exponents. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_☉/nFe_☉ ) =0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^0.3 (nSi_☉/nFe_☉ )

And [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_☉/nH_☉.

So, nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1 ) * (nFe_1/nH_1 ) = 10^0.3 (nSi_☉/nFe_☉ ) * (nFe_☉/nH_☉ ) ) = 10^0.3 (nSi_☉/nH_☉ )

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_☉/nH_☉.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2 ) - log(nMg_☉/nSi_☉ )=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^0.3 (nMg_☉/nSi_☉ )

So, nSi_2 = nMg_2/(10^0.3 (nMg_☉/nSi_☉ ) )

But nMg_2 =nMg_☉/nH_☉ *nH_2.

So,

nSi_2 = (nMg_☉/nH_☉ *nH_2 ) / (10^0.3 (nMg_☉/nSi_☉ ) )

= (nH_2 /nH_☉ ) * [nSi_☉/(10^0.3 ) ].

So, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_☉ )/(nH_☉ 10^0.3 )

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [10^0.3 (nSi_☉/nH_☉ ) ] / [ (nSi_☉ )/(nH_☉ 10^0.3 ) ) ]

= [10^0.3 * nSi_☉/nH_☉ ] * [nH_☉ 10^0.3 / nSi_☉ ]

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (nH_☉ /nH_☉ ) * (nSi_☉/nSi_☉ )

= 10^(0.6) → approx 3.98.

So, if (nSi_1/nH_1) = 4 * (nSi_2/nH_2 ), then nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nH_1 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

Wait, no, let's think again.

nSi_1 = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) *nH_1.

nSi_2 = (nSi_2/nH_2 ) *nH_2.

So, nSi_1/nSi_2 = [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) *nH_1 ] / [ (nSi_2/nH_2 ) *nH_2 ]

= [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ] * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

We found that [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ] = 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But without knowing the ratio of nH_1/nH_2, we can't find the exact ratio of nSi_1/nSi_2.

Wait a minute, but perhaps in the photosphere, the ratio of hydrogen to other elements is the same for both stars? Because the problem only gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as zero for their respective stars. Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, but for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0. So, [Fe/H]_2 isn't given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the total hydrogen is the same. But I think that's not given.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars, but that's an assumption not stated.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the total number of hydrogen atoms per unit volume is the same, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the key is that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0, but what about the other elements? The problem doesn't give [Fe/H]_2, but perhaps the ratio of H in each star's photosphere is such that it cancels out. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the ratio of silicon is directly given by the product of [Si/Fe] and [Fe/Si] or something like that.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_☉/nFe_☉ )

And for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, so nMg_2/nSi_2=10^0.3 (nMg_☉/nSi_☉ )

But how does that tie back to silicon?

Another approach: express everything in terms of solar abundances.

Let me denote:

nSi_☉ = S, nFe_☉ = F, nMg_☉ = M, nH_☉ = H.

So, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^0.3 * (S/F )

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = (F/H) nH_1.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (10^0.3 * S/F ) = (F/H nH_1 ) * (10^0.3 S/F )= (10^0.3 S)/(H ) *nH_1.

So, nSi_1 =10^0.3 (S/H ) nH_1.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2=10^0.3 (M/S )

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2= (M/H) nH_2.

So, nSi_2= nMg_2/(10^0.3 (M/S )) = (M/H nH_2 )/(10^0.3 (M/S )) = (1/(H )) (nH_2 ) (S)/(10^0.3 M ) * M )? Wait,

Wait, nMg_2= (M/H ) nH_2.

So,

nSi_2 = (M/H nH_2 ) / (10^0.3 (M/S )) )

= [ (M nH_2 )/(H ) ] / [ (10^0.3 M S^{-1} ) ]

= [ M nH_2 / H ] * [ S / (10^0.3 M ) ]

= [ nH_2 / H ] * [ S/(10^0.3 ) ]

So, nSi_2= (nH_2 / H ) * (S / 10^0.3 )

Now, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 is:

[10^0.3 (S/H ) nH_1 ] / [ (nH_2 / H ) * (S /10^0.3 ) ) ]

= [10^0.3 (S/H ) nH_1 ] * [ H/(nH_2 ) * 10^0.3 / S )

= (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) * (S/H * H ) / (S ) ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

= 10^0.6 * (1) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

So, nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^0.6 * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

Hmm, but without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, I can't compute this. Unless I can find a way to relate nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

nSi_1 =10^0.3 (S/H ) nH_1.

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / H ) * (S / (10^0.3 ) )

So, ratio = [10^0.3 (S/H ) nH_1 ] / [ (nH_2 / H ) * (S /10^0.3 ) ) ]

= [10^0.3 * (S/H ) * nH_1 ] * [ H / (nH_2 S ) * 10^0.3 ]

= 10^0.3 * 10^0.3 * (S/H * H )/(S) ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

= 10^(0.6) * 1 * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

So, ratio =10^0.6 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

But unless we know how the hydrogen atoms compare between the two stars, I can't find this ratio. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same for both stars. That is, nH_1 =nH_2. If that's the case, then the ratio becomes 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So the answer would be option A (~3.9). But is that a valid assumption?

The problem doesn't explicitly state that, but given that the question is about the ratio of silicon, and the only other information is about [Fe/...], perhaps the total number of hydrogen is the same for both stars.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same overall number of hydrogen for both stars, meaning that nH_1 =nH_2.

In that case, the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, so the answer is option A.

But wait, another angle: the problem states that the photospheric composition for the Sun is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

Wait, so 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH )=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^-4.5 ≈3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH )=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for the Sun, nFe/nH=3.16e-5, nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, the ratio of Mg to Fe in the Sun is (1e-5)/(3.16e-5 )=1/3.16≈0.316. So, [Mg/Fe]_☉ = log(0.316 )= -0.5. But that might not be directly relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps I need to compute the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2 using the expressions we have, but without knowing the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2, I can't get a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the same number of hydrogen atoms. If I assume that nH_1 =nH_2, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, leading to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the same number of hydrogen atoms, making the ratio 10^0.6. That would make the answer A.

So, after this lengthy thought process, I think the correct answer is A, approximately 3.9.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X,☉/N_Y,☉). The key steps are as follows:

### For Star_1:
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: This implies  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,☉}}}{n_{\text{Fe,☉}}}.
  \]
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,☉}}}{n_{\text{H,☉}}}.
  \]
- Combining these, the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen is:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,☉}}}{n_{\text{H,☉}}}.
  \]

### For Star_2:
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: This implies  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg,☉}}}{n_{\text{Si,☉}}}.
  \]
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,☉}}}{n_{\text{H,☉}}}.
  \]
- Rearranging for silicon:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{1}{10^{0.3}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,☉}}}{n_{\text{H,☉}}}.
  \]

### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,☉}}}{n_{\text{H,☉}}}}{\frac{1}{10^{0.3}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,☉}}}{n_{\text{H,☉}}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Final Calculation:
- \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), which is approximately 3.9.

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
