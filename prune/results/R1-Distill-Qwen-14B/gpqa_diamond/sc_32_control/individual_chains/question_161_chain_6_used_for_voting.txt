Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my vacuum physics, but let me think through this.

So the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, right? The idea is to minimize gas molecules so that when the electron beam is on, the electrons don't get scattered too much by these gas particles. Because if there are gas molecules around, the electrons can collide with them, which would blur the image in the microscope.

But even with that ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles are still there, and a mass spectrometer detected them. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Or something like that.

But here's the kicker: when Mike turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. And the temperature remained the same because the sample compartment didn't change temp. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path in the absence of the electron beam was λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. How does that affect the gas molecules?

Oh, right, the electrons can cause ionization of the gas molecules. When the electron beam hits the gas, it can knock out electrons from the gas atoms or molecules, creating ions. These ions have a charge, so they might behave differently. How does that affect the mean free path?

I think that ionized particles would experience electrostatic forces. But wait, in an electron microscope, the electron beam is a high-energy beam. If gas molecules get ionized, they become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum might move more, perhaps, but how does that relate to the mean free path?

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. If the gas is neutral, collisions are just between neutral molecules. But if some molecules are ionized, perhaps their behavior changes. Do they interact more or less with each other?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces a charge on the gas molecules. If a gas molecule is ionized, it's more likely to interact with the beam or other charged particles. But wait, the mean free path would be determined by the probability of collisions between the gas particles themselves. So if some are charged, do they collide more or less frequently?

Wait, but wait another angle—maybe the ionization causes some of the gas to be in a different state. For example, if the neutral gas has a certain mean free path, but when ionized, their effective diameter changes. Or maybe they move faster because they're charged and influenced by electric fields.

Wait, the mean free path equation is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*pi*d^2*P). So factors are T, pressure, and the collision diameter d. But in the case of ions, the collision diameter might be different. Also, the ions might have different velocities.

Wait, but Mike measured λ1 under the vacuum conditions without the electron beam. Then when the beam is on, the gas is ionized. So the mean free path λ2 is determined by the ionized gas.

How does ionization affect the mean free path? Let's think about the collision cross-section. If the gas is neutral, it's neutral molecules. When ionized, maybe the cross-section changes. For example, if the ions are moving faster, perhaps their mean free path increases. Alternatively, if the ions are charged, they might repel each other more, thus reducing the collision rate and increasing the mean free path.

Wait, but if the gas is at the same temperature, but some molecules are ionized, the average velocity might change? Or the collision frequency.

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of the electron beam, the gas particles may become excited or ionized, which might change their effective diameter. For example, ions might have a larger effective diameter because the charge affects how they interact. Or maybe the ionization doesn't affect the diameter much.

Alternatively, maybe the ionization leads to a lower density of neutral gas because some are ionized. Wait, but the pressure is the same because the pumps are running. Hmm, but the pressure in the compartment is still under ultra-high vacuum, so it's a low-pressure situation. But when the beam is on, maybe some gas gets ionized, but the pressure is still the same because the pumps keep it low.

Wait, the pressure P in the mean free path equation is the same, because the pumps are maintaining the same pressure. So why would λ change? Because the equation uses d, the collision diameter. If ionization changes d, then λ would change.

If the gas molecules are ionized, perhaps their effective diameter increases. For example, ions have an effective size that includes their charge cloud. If d increases, then the denominator in λ becomes larger, so λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the collision diameter d increases, the mean free path λ = (kT)/(sqrt(2)*pi*d² P) would decrease. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Looking back at the options, that would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another angle: the presence of a charged beam could cause the gas to be more likely to move, perhaps increasing the mean free path. Because the electrons are moving quickly and maybe sweeping the ions along, making them move further before colliding. Or maybe the ionization leads to the gas molecules moving faster.

Wait, but in the presence of an electron beam, the gas molecules are being bombarded by high-energy electrons. This could cause them to gain energy, perhaps increasing their velocity. If their velocity increases, the mean free path would increase because λ is proportional to velocity over collision rate.

Wait, mean free path λ = v * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions. If velocity v increases, τ would decrease because collisions happen more often, but maybe the product stays the same, or does it?

Alternatively, the formula for mean free path can also be written as λ = (1/√2) * sqrt( (3kT)/(π m d²) ) ), where m is the mass of the molecule. So if the temperature T is the same, but the mass m changes (unlikely here), or if the effective diameter d changes.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the mass might change if it's a different ion, but that's not the case here. The same gas is present, just some are ionized. So the mass m remains same.

But the collision diameter d might change. For ions, the collision diameter could be larger because of the charge. So if d increases, λ decreases.

Alternatively, when a gas is ionized, perhaps they're accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. The electron beam is focused with electrostatic and magnetic lenses. The ions, being charged, could be deflected or accelerated, perhaps causing them to move more, which might affect their mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path is about their movement due to their own thermal motion, not external fields. Or wait, in a vacuum, the molecules move freely, but in the presence of a beam, perhaps the beam's electric field affects their movement. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it can cause gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which might cause them to have a higher effective cross-sectional area. So, more likely to collide, thus reducing the mean free path.

So, putting it all together: λ1 is the mean free path under vacuum conditions without the beam. When the beam is on, the gas is ionized, leading to a larger effective diameter (d), which would make λ2 = (kT)/(sqrt(2)*pi*(d')² * P) < λ1. So λ2 < λ1. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

The question involves understanding how the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope changes when the electron beam is activated. Initially, the mean free path is λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr) without the electron beam. When the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path changes to λ2, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.

The mean free path is given by the equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(d\) is the collision diameter of the gas molecules, and \(P\) is the pressure. In this scenario, the temperature \(T\) and pressure \(P\) remain constant, so any change in the mean free path must be due to changes in the collision diameter \(d\).

When the electron beam is activated, it can ionize some of the gas molecules. Ionized gas molecules have an effective diameter \(d'\) that is larger than the diameter of neutral molecules because the ionization introduces a charge cloud around the molecules. This increase in the effective collision diameter (\(d' > d\)) reduces the mean free path, as the denominator in the equation becomes larger. Therefore, the mean free path decreases, and we conclude that:

\[
\lambda_2 < \lambda_1
\]

Among the given options, this corresponds to option C.
