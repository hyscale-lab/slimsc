Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, with various concentrations given.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is the complex ion CaY^2- where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The reaction should be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). 

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, without any dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because the complex can dissociate a little, we have to find the [Ca^2+] in the solution.

Since K is pretty large (5x10^10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and free EDTA^4- should be really low, but let's see.

Let me think about the setup. Let's let s be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates from the complex. So when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA gives one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentrations would be:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca^2+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

Change upon dissociation:
[CaEDTA^2-] decreases by s → 0.02 - s
[Ca^2+] increases by s → s
[EDTA^4-] increases by s → s

Since K is so large, s will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02. That should simplify the calculations.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02) / (s * s) ) = 0.02/(s²)

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02/(s²)

Solving for s²:

s² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13? Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So:

s² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no: 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. So 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13? No, wait 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? No, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? Let me think: 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4 * 1e-13. So yes, s² = 4e-13 → s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5?

Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * (10^0.5 * 10^-7) ) ≈ 2 * (3.162e-7) ≈ 6.324e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is correct. 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approx 6.32e-7.

So s is about 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca^2+ is 6.32e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but let me recheck the math.

K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10.

Assume [Ca] = [EDTA] = s.

So K = 0.02/(s^2) =5e10 → s^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Wait, that can't be right. 0.4e-12 is 4e-13.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13? No, wait 0.4e-12 is 4e-13. Wait no, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? Because 0.4 is 4 * 10^-1. So 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? Yes. So s²=4e-13 → s=√(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 6.5 is 6 and a half, which is 6+0.5. 10^0.5 is about 3.162, so 10^-6.5 is 3.162e-7.

So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( s \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions that dissociate from the complex. Initially, \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = 0\). After dissociation:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - s \approx 0.02 \, \text{(since } K \text{ is large, } s \ll 0.02)
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = s
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{s^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( s^2 \):

\[
s^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
s = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
