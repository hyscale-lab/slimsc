Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, it's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. The question gives me the concentrations and volumes of HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical reaction I know is H+ + OH- → H2O, and for strong acids and bases, this is a pretty standard value, usually around -57 kJ/mol or something like that. Wait, but I need to be careful because the problem might involve different amounts of acid and base, so I have to find out which is the limiting reactant.

The problem mentions three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So, when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Let me list out the data:

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M.
H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M.
Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M.

I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base. Then see which is the limiting one because the reaction will only go to the point where one of them is used up.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Similarly, HCl is monoprotic, so one H+ per molecule. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH-.

So let me calculate each:

For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, volume = 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L)
Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Since each gives one H+, moles of H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

For H2SO4:
Molarity = 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so H+ from H2SO4 = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.5 M, volume = 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so OH- moles = 0.2 mol.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The moles of H+ available are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant here because 0.2 <0.28. That means all 0.2 mol OH- will react, but there will be some H+ left over.

Wait, but wait a second. So the total H+ available is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization will use up all the OH- and 0.2 mol of H+.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 mol, but wait, no, water is formed in a 1:1 H+ to OH- ratio, so 0.2 mol of H2O would form. So the heat released depends on how much H+ and OH- reacted.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually given as -57 kJ per mole of H2O, but sometimes in calories (I think 1 cal is about 4.184 J). Wait, the options are in kcal and kJ, so I need to get the units right.

Wait, but wait another thing. Each mole of H+ from an acid and each mole of OH- from a base combine. So if the OH- is the limiting reagent, all OH- will react, and the total moles of H+ that react is equal to the moles of OH-.

So for this problem, 0.2 mol of OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the total moles reacting is 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, making 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (ΔH per mole of H2O).

But wait, what is the ΔH of neutralization for each acid? Wait, no, because HCl and H2SO4 are both strong acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So their neutralization reactions would each have the same ΔH per mole of H2O formed as the standard value, which is about -57 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. Hmm, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it neutralizes with a base, each mole of H2SO4 would produce two moles of H2O. But in this case, the OH- is the limiting reactant, so the amount of H+ that reacts is limited by the OH- available.

Let me think again. The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the reaction will proceed until all 0.2 OH- is consumed, which uses 0.2 H+.

Thus, the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy change (ΔH) is 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the options have -11.42 kcal as option B, and -16.0 kJ as option D. Oh wait, but 57 is in kJ per mole, so 0.2 *57= 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, in the options, B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, so I'm getting kJ but the options have kcal. Oh, perhaps I'm making a mistake in units.

Wait, wait. Let me check. 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So if I have the enthalpy per mole in kcal, perhaps I'm supposed to use a different value.

Wait, standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as about -57 kJ/mol, but sometimes it's given as about -13.6 kcal/mol. Because 57,000 J is 57 kJ, which is about 13.6 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4184 J, so 57000 J /4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal).

Wait, so if the standard ΔH is -57 kJ/mol or -13.6 kcal/mol, then 0.2 mol would be 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal? Or wait, 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, the options are given as A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

So if I use 57 kJ/mol, the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is close to option D, which is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the initial calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the reaction can only proceed until OH- is exhausted, using 0.2 H+.

Thus, moles of H2O formed: 0.2.

So if ΔH per mole is -57 kJ, then total ΔH is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the value per mole of acid, but I think the standard is per mole of H2O.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total enthalpy change for all the possible neutralization, but only considering the limiting reagent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the equivalents. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole contributes 2 equivalents of H+. Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 equivalents of OH- per mole.

So the equivalents of H+ is:

HCl: 0.1 *1 = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 *2= 0.18 eq.

Total H+ eq: 0.28 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 *2= 0.2 eq.

So H+ has 0.28 eq, OH- has 0.2 eq. So neutralization stops when 0.2 eq of H+ and OH- have reacted.

So the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Thus, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not matching. Wait, but perhaps the standard value used is different. Wait, sometimes the value is 57 kJ per mole for a monoprotic acid and base. But here, the reaction involves H2SO4, a diprotic acid. So perhaps the calculation is a bit more involved.

Wait, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 can neutralize two moles of Ba(OH)2. Let me think about the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I should write the reaction equations.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl^-.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely as H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, dissociates into Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when these are mixed, the H+ from both acids will react with OH^- from the base.

As before, the moles H+ are 0.28, OH- 0.2. So OH- is limiting.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (ΔH per mole of H2O).

If ΔH per mole is -57 kJ, then total is -11.4 kJ.

But wait option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for ΔH. Let me think. I recall that sometimes the neutralization enthalpy is given as -57 kJ per mole of H2O. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Hmm, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal? Wait, wait no. Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ.

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that's option A. But earlier I thought the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is not exactly an option.

Wait, but the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles correctly again.

Wait, HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 mol/L=0.1 mol; H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 *2=0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2:0.2 L *0.5=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 *2=0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction moles are 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

So 0.2 moles of H2O.

If each mole of H2O releases 57 kJ, then 0.2 → 11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match that in kJ except D is -16.0, which is larger. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction isn't just H+ + OH- → H2O, but considering the specific neutralization reactions of each acid.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the neutralization for each acid separately.

So HCl is a monoprotic acid. Neutralizing it with a base would produce 1 mole of H2O per mole of HCl.

H2SO4 is diprotic. Each mole produces 2 moles of H2O.

So perhaps I should find how much of each acid reacts with the base.

Wait, but the base is Ba(OH)2, which can provide 2 OH- per mole.

So the base can neutralize H+ from both acids.

But since the base is limited by the amount of OH- available, which is 0.2 mol, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol.

So, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+ (all of it), and H2SO4 contributes 0.18 mol H+. So total H+ is 0.28.

So 0.2 mol of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

But which H+ comes from which acid? It depends on the concentration.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization will use up the H+ from HCl first, as it's a monoprotic strong acid, and then the H2SO4.

Wait, let me think: when you mix all these together, the H+ ions from both acids are available. The OH- will react with H+ from any source until they are all consumed.

So the OH- (0.2 mol) will take H+ from both acids. So first, HCl's 0.1 mol H+ will react with 0.1 mol OH-, leaving 0.1 mol OH- to react with H2SO4.

Each H2SO4 provides 2 H+, but we only need 0.1 mol H+ to neutralize the remaining 0.1 mol OH-.

So from H2SO4, 0.05 mol will react (since each provides 2 H+). So total H+ reacted: 0.1 (from HCl) +0.05 *2=0.1 +0.1=0.2 mol.

So total H2O formed: 0.2 mol.

But wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole contributes two H+. So the moles of H2SO4 needed to provide 0.1 mol H+ is 0.05 mol.

So now, the enthalpy from HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → 0.1 mol H2O → 0.1 * (-57 kJ) = -5.7 kJ.

From H2SO4: 0.05 mol H2SO4 → provides 0.1 mol H+ → same as 0.1 mol H2O → another -5.7 kJ.

Total ΔH = (-5.7) + (-5.7) = -11.4 kJ.

So the total is -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate based on the equivalents.

Wait, the HCl has 0.1 eq (because 0.1 mol *1), H2SO4 has 0.18 eq (0.09 mol *2), and Ba(OH)2 has 0.2 eq (0.1 mol *2).

So the available equivalents are 0.28, and the base provides 0.2 eq.

So all 0.2 eq will be neutralized. So the total H2O is 0.2 mol.

Thus, same as before, -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the mistake is in the unit conversion.

Wait, the options have some in kcal and some in kJ.

If I think in kcal, using 57 kJ per mole is 13.6 kcal per mole.

So 0.2 moles *13.6 kcal/mol= 2.72 kcal. So the change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why would the answer be presented in kcal? Typically, in chemistry, we use kJ. But maybe the question expects it in kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that each mole of H2O is -57,000 calories. Wait, but wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J, and 1 kcal is 4184 J.

So 57,000 J /4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal. So 57 kJ is 13.6 kcal.

So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 *13.6=2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But the initial calculation gave me 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps I'm missing the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and each reaction releases more heat? No, because the neutralization per mole of H2O is standard, regardless of the acid.

Wait, but when you have H2SO4, the neutralization releases more heat because it's diprotic. Wait, no, because each mole of H2O formed contributes the same ΔH.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that the initial calculation of H+ is correct, but the way to calculate enthalpy is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation of the most probable answer, considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and that each mole contributes 2 H+.

But I think I accounted for that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is actually asking for the total neutralization, but in reality, H2SO4 may not be fully dissociated, but since it's a strong acid, it should be fully dissociated.

So, I'm confident that the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the options are A) -2.72 kcal and D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, but wait, 11.4 kJ is not an option except D is -16.0 kJ. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, let me double-check the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. So H+ is 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L= 0.09 mol. → H+ is 0.18.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 mol. → OH- is 0.2.

Yes, that's correct.

So the limiting reagent is OH- with 0.2 mol.

Thus, 0.2 mol H2O formed.

So why is the answer not in the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation using the standard value of 57.3 kJ per mole of H2O. So 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ → approximately -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options have that. Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units. Let me think: the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

If the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal). So option A is -2.72 kcal, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.3 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, but the closest is D) -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, the neutralization reaction for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce 2 moles of H2O.

So perhaps I should calculate how much of each reacts.

But wait, when you mix all solutions, the H+ comes from both acids and OH- from the base. So the total H+ is from HCl and H2SO4, and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is about the total moles of H+ and OH- in solution, and the heat is calculated per mole of acid-base reaction, regardless of the source.

Wait, but the approach is the same as before.

So I think the correct answer should be -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M *0.5 L=0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL=0.3 L. 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L. 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So yes, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the limiting reagent is OH-, 0.2 mol.

So the moles of H2O are 0.2.

So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Which would be option D if it was -11.4 kJ, but it's -16.0 kJ. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup.

Wait, wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the heat released per mole of reaction, but considering that the enthalpy per mole of acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the total moles of each and see the neutralization.

Wait, for HCl and Ba(OH)2:

Each mole of HCl (1 H+) needs 1 OH-.

HCl: 0.1 mol → needs 0.1 mol OH-.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.2 mol OH-.

So after neutralizing HCl, 0.1 mol OH- remains.

Now, the H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

The remaining OH- is 0.1 mol, which can neutralize 0.1 mol H+.

So from H2SO4, 0.1 mol H+ is neutralized, which comes from 0.05 mol H2SO4 (since each gives 2 H+).

So total H2O formed: 0.1 (from HCl) +0.1 (from H2SO4) =0.2 mol.

So same as before. So ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So why?

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

If the standard ΔH is -57 kJ per mole of H2O.

So 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. So negative, so -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the answer in kJ but a different ΔH value.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the total heat released from all possible neutralizations, but that doesn't make sense because the limiting reagent is the OH-.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 mol.

Each mole gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol.

Yes.

HCl is 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 *0.3=0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ is 0.28. OH- is 0.2.

So all OH- reacts, using 0.2 H+, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

Thus, the total moles of H2O is 0.2.

So the calculation is correct.

So where is the discrepancy in the options?

Let me look at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

So option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.4 kJ (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, so 11.42 *4.184 ≈48.3 kJ).

But that's much higher than our calculation. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, but using a different ΔH value.

Wait, if the ΔH is taken as -57,000 cal per mole (which is -57 kcal), then 0.2 mol would be -11.4 kcal, which is close to option B's -11.42 kcal.

But wait, that can't be right because 57,000 cal is 57 kcal, but the standard is -57 kJ per mole, not kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the ΔH is taken as -57 kcal per mole.

If so, 0.2 mol * (-57 kcal/mol) = -11.4 kcal, which is option B.

But I'm confused because usually the standard value is in kJ, not kcal.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of 57.3 kcal per mole of H2O. So 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kcal → approximately -11.46 kcal, which is option B.

So, in that case, the answer would be option B.

But I'm a bit torn because standard practice uses kJ. But the option B is closer.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the value of 57.3 kJ/mol, and expecting the answer in kcal.

Wait, 57.3 kJ is 57,300 J. To convert to kcal: 57,300 /4184 ≈13.68 kcal.

So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 *13.68≈2.736 kcal → approximately -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A's -2.72 kcal.

So that would make option A the answer.

But why would the question mix units like that? It provides three volumes in mL and concentrations in M, which is standard, but the options are a mix of kcal and kJ.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the heat released in kJ, but the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but that only the first dissociation is complete, and the second is not. But no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, both dissociations are complete in aqueous solution.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm mixing up moles of H+ and moles of H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total equivalents.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 N = 0.1 eq (since it's monoprotic).

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 *2 =0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 *2 =0.2 eq.

So total equivalents: 0.1 +0.18=0.28 eq.

Available OH- equivalents:0.2.

So neutralization is 0.2 eq → 0.2 moles of H2O.

Thus, ΔH is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) =-11.4 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. The closest is D: -16.0 kJ.

But I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 as a separate reaction, and HCl as another.

So for Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4:

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4:0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2:0.1 mol.

The reaction ratio is 1:1.

So H2SO4 is limiting, but Ba(OH)2 is in 0.1 mol, which is more than H2SO4's 0.09.

So all 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.18 mol H2O.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol → which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

Then, HCl:0.1 mol H+ will react with 0.02 mol OH-, producing 0.02 mol H2O.

So total H2O: 0.18 +0.02=0.2 mol.

Same result as before.

Thus, ΔH is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So again, the same conclusion.

But the options don't have this. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of 57 kcal per mole, which would lead to 11.42 kcal * (-1) = -11.42 kcal, which is option B.

But that would require using the wrong units for ΔH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid, not per mole of H2O.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

In any case, I think the correct approach leads to ΔH =-11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the total heat released when all the H+ and OH- are neutralized, but that can't be because OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that I should calculate the heat for each acid and base reaction separately.

For example:

HCl and Ba(OH)2: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But each HCl provides 1 H+, each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So reaction would be: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So the moles of HCl needed per mole of Ba(OH)2 is 2.

Moles of HCl available:0.1; moles of Ba(OH)2:0.1.

So for 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, need 0.2 mol HCl. But only 0.1 mol HCl is available. So HCl is limiting.

So HCl can neutralize 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2.

So moles of H2O:0.1.

Heat from this reaction:0.1 mol H2O →0.1 * (-57 kJ) =-5.7 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2:0.1 -0.05=0.05 mol → which provides 0.1 mol OH-.

Then, H2SO4:0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

The 0.1 mol OH- can neutralize 0.1 mol H+.

So from H2SO4, 0.05 mol H2SO4 is used (0.05 *2=0.1 H+).

Thus, H2O formed:0.1 (from HCl) +0.1 (from H2SO4) =0.2 mol.

Heat:0.2 * (-57) =-11.4 kJ.

Same as before.

So I think the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as 11.4 kJ in kcal.

Wait, wait because if I compute 11.4 kJ to kcal, 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as 11.4 kJ.

So perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal, leading to option A.

But why would the problem expect that? I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using 57 kJ per mole.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy is 57,300 cal per mole, which is 57.3 kcal.

So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kcal, which is option B.

So then the answer would be option B.

But I'm not certain. I think I've spent enough time on this. I think the correct approach leads to 0.2 moles of H2O, and the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is equivalent to -11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} + 0.18 \, \text{mol} = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it will be completely consumed, leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ unreacted.

4. **Calculate moles of H₂O formed:**
   - Since OH⁻ is limiting, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O is formed.

5. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is \( \Delta H = -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of H₂O.  
   - Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

6. **Convert to kcal if necessary:**  
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{1}{4.184} \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

7. **Analyze the options:**  
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value when converted to kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.

The correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, which corresponds to the calculated enthalpy change when expressed in kcal.

Answer: A
