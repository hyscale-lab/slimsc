Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. First, I need to understand what the complexes are. So, cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate. The stability constant, β, tells us how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. 

So, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)₁, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃, and Co(SCN)₄. But wait, the order of the beta values is β1=9, then β2=40, beta3=63, and beta4=16. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because beta3 is higher than beta2, but beta4 is lower. So the most stable complex is the third one, Co(SCN)₃? Interesting.

The question asks specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions, so that would be the Co(SCN)₂ complex. Right, so we're looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²+ ions in the solution.

So, the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then find the percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex.

I remember that when dealing with complexes and stability constants, the distribution of species can be found using the logarithms and the stability constants. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on their stability and the concentrations of the ions.

The formula I think I should use is the one for the fraction of each species in the solution. The fraction f_n for the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [Co²+][SCN^-]^n) / (sum over all m of β_m [Co²+][SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but wait. The formula might be a bit different. Let me think again. The total concentration of all complexes and free ions is equal to the total cobalt concentration, which is given as 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ plus [Co²+] equals c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But when you have a series of complexes, you can model their formation using the stability constants. The stability constant for each complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the ions. For example, β₂ is the constant for Co²+ + 2 SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)_2²+. So, β₂ = [Co(SCN)_2²+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2).

To find the fraction of each complex, we can use the following approach. The fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n²+] / [Co²+] (but wait, no, actually f_n is [Co(SCN)_n²+] divided by the sum of all [Co...], including the free Co²+).

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to model the fraction using the concept of formation. The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but wait. Since the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n²+] plus [Co²+]. Alternatively, [Co²+] = c(Co) / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 (β_n [SCN^-]^n )) )

Wait, no. Let me think about the general expression. For each complex, the formation can be linked. Let me define x = [Co²+], which is the free ion concentration. Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n²+] = β_n * x * [SCN^-]^n 

Because each complex is formed by the free Co²+ and n SCN^- ions. So, the total concentration of Co is:

x + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n x [SCN^-]^n = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

We can factor x out:

x [1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n [SCN^-]^n ] = c(Co)

So, x = c(Co) / [1 + sum β_n [SCN^-]^n ]

Once we have x, we can find each [Co(SCN)_n²+] as β_n x [SCN^-]^n. Then, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n²+] / c(Co), which is (β_n x [SCN^-]^n ) / c(Co).

But since x = c(Co) / denominator, substituting:

[Co(SCN)_n²+] = β_n x [SCN]^n = β_n (c(Co) / denominator ) [SCN]^n.

So, [Co(SCN)_n²+] = c(Co) * β_n [SCN]^n / denominator.

Thus, the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n) / denominator.

Wait, because denominator is 1 + sum_{m=1}^4 β_m [SCN]^m.

So, the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 β_m [SCN]^m )

Wait, but that makes sense because each complex is formed by the free Co²+ and the respective number of SCN^- ions. So, the denominator is the total sum of all possibilities, including the free Co²+.

So, now, we can compute this for each n.

The question is asking for the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2²+] complex, which is n=2.

So, let's compute the denominator first.

Denominator D = 1 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Given:
β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16
[SCN^-] = 0.1 M

So, let's compute each term:

Term for β1: 9 * (0.1) = 0.9
Term for β2:40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4
Term for β3:63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001 =0.063
Term for β4:16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Adding all terms:

1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = Let's compute step by step.

1 + 0.9 =1.9
1.9 +0.4=2.3
2.3 +0.063=2.363
2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So, denominator D=2.3646

Now, the fraction f_2 is (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D.

β2 [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40 * 0.01=0.4

So, f_2=0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let's compute:

2.3646 * 0.169 is about 0.3998.

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.169 = let's compute:

2.3646 * 0.1 = 0.23646
2.3646 * 0.06 =0.141876
2.3646 *0.009=0.0212814
Adding them: 0.23646 +0.141876=0.378336 +0.0212814=0.3996174, which is approximately 0.4. So, 0.169 gives approximately 0.4.

So, 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or about 16.9%. But wait, wait a minute. The options include 16.9% (option D). But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]²+. So according to this, it's about 16.9% which is option D.

But wait, wait. I think I might have mixed up n. Wait, are the beta values in the order β1, β2, β3, β4 corresponding to n=1,2,3,4? The question says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So yes, n=1 to 4.

Wait, but in the calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] is the second complex, which is n=2, and that's the fraction f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169. So 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 42.3%
B)25.6%
C)38.1%
D)16.9%

So, option D is 16.9%, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the denominator calculation.

Denominator D = 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016.

Adding those:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646. Correct.

Then f2=0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 → 16.9%, which is option D.

Hmm, but wait, some sources I remember say that when you have a series of complexes, the most abundant species is the one with the highest beta multiplied by [SCN]^(n), but in our case, the denominator includes all, so the fractions are normalized.

Wait, in our case, f3 is (63*(0.1)^3)/2.3646 = 63*0.001=0.063 → 0.063/2.3646 ≈ 0.0266, so about 2.66%.

And f4 is 16*(0.1)^4=16e-4=0.0016 → 0.0016/2.3646≈0.000677, which is about 0.0677%.

So, the largest fraction is f1: 9*(0.1)=0.9 → 0.9/2.3646≈0.381 → 38.1%, which is option C.

Wait, so f1 is about 38.1% and f2 is about 16.9%. So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]²+. So that's f2, which is approximately 16.9%, option D.

Wait, but wait, I thought sometimes the dithiocyanato complex is the one with higher stability, but in this case, the β3 is higher than β2, so the third complex is more stable. So why is the fraction for n=3 so low?

Ah, because [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is relatively low. The higher order complexes require more SCN^- ions, and with a lower [SCN], the higher n terms contribute less.

So, the fraction ends up being higher for lower n because even though β3 is bigger, the [SCN]^3 is 0.001, which is much smaller than [SCN]^2 (0.01) and [SCN]^1 (0.1). So β3 * [SCN]^3 is 63 * 0.001 = 0.063, which is lower than β2 * [SCN]^2, which is 40 * 0.01=0.4.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4, which is a bigger term than n=3's 0.063. So f2 is about 16.9%, which is option D.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the thiocyanate concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10⁻² M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex, fₙ, is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{m=1}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is:

\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Adding these terms:

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺
For \( n = 2 \), the fraction is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
f_2 \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
