Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that resemble those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be, relative to the star's radius, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, right, so when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The bigger the planet compared to the star, the larger the dip.

But in this case, the star has spots. So when the spots rotate into view, they make the star appear dimmer because they're cooler. But when the star is not spotted (the other hemisphere), it's at the higher temperature. So the variation in brightness from the spots would be similar to a planet blocking the star's light.

The problem says the star's one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Hmm, so the filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. Wait, the filling factor is the area covered by spots relative to the hemisphere.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so its surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So if one hemisphere has 20% (or 0.2) spots, that's 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² of spots. So the total area of spots is 0.4πR².

But wait, the question is about comparing the spot effect to a planet's transit. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star's brightness decreases because those spots are cooler, right? The planet, when it transits, blocks a part of the star's surface, causing the same kind of dip.

So the brightness variation caused by the spots would be similar to the variation caused by a planet whose area is equal to the area of the spots. Wait, no, because the spots are spread over a hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, changing the overall brightness.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the equivalent of a planet covering the same area as the spots. But I'm a bit confused because the spots are spread across a hemisphere, but the planet would block a circular area.

Wait no, the star's brightness variations due to spots would be a continuous dimming as the spots rotate. But a planet's transit would cause a sharp dip when it moves across the star's disk.

Wait, but the question says that the photometric variations can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness dip from the spots must be similar in amplitude to the dip from a planet.

So I need to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are transiting (or when the star is appearing with spots to us) and compare that to the fractional change when a planet transits.

Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, part of the spotted hemisphere comes into view, leading to a change in brightness. But the planet would cause a similar dip when it's in front.

Wait, but the problem is considering the amplitude of the brightness variation. So when the spots are observed, the star's brightness is lower, and when it's not, it's higher. The amplitude of this variation should match the amplitude of the dip caused by a planet.

Wait, so the star's brightness variation due to spots: when the spots are on the visible side, the star appears dimmer; when the unspotted side is visible, it's brighter. So the change in brightness depends on the temperature difference and the area of the spots.

On the other hand, a planet causes a dip in brightness equal to the area of the planet relative to the star, multiplied by the star's flux.

Wait, but the flux from the star depends on its temperature. So for the star, the total flux is σTeff^4 * 4πRstar^2. The flux from the spots is σ(Teff - 1000)^4 multiplied by the area of the spots.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's total flux is L = 4πRstar² σ Teff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot emits less flux. So the total flux when the spots are visible would be L * (1 - (A_spots * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) ), approximately. Wait, no. Because each spot has a lower T, its contribution is lower. So the change in flux would be the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

Alternatively, the flux from the spots is (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) times the flux from the rest of the star. So the change in flux would be (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) multiplied by the area of the spots divided by the total area.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the flux from the star without spots is F = σTeff^4. The flux from the spots is F_spot = σ(Teff - 1000)^4. So the total flux when the spots are visible would be (F) * (1 - A_spots) + F_spot * A_spots.

But A_spots is the area of the spots divided by the total star area. Hmm.

Wait, the star's total area is 4πRstar². The area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πRstar² = 0.4πRstar², as I thought earlier.

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) = 0.4/4 = 0.1, or 10%. Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2πR², so spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the fraction is 0.4πR² /4πR² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, but the star has only one hemisphere spotted. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 10% of the star's surface is spots. When the other hemisphere is facing, the spots are on the back side, so no spots are visible. So the brightness variation is between the star being at maximum brightness (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible) and minimum brightness (when the spotted hemisphere is visible).

Wait, no. Because the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is 2πR². If one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%, that means 20% of that hemisphere's area is spots. So 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the fractional area of the spots relative to the entire star is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 10% of the star's surface is spots. So the total flux from the star would be:

Flux = (1 - 0.1) * σTeff^4 + 0.1 * σ(Teff-1000)^4.

Wait, no. That's not exactly right. Because each spot is a part of the surface, so each spot contributes its own flux. So the total flux is (area without spots) * flux per unit area (Teff^4) plus (area with spots) * flux per unit area (T_spot^4).

So the flux when the spots are visible is:

F_spots_visible = (1 - A_spots) * F_total + A_spots * F_spot,

where A_spots is the fractional area covered by spots (0.1), F_total is the star's flux per unit area (σTeff^4), and F_spot is σ(Teff-1000)^4.

Wait, but wait. The star's total flux is F_total = σTeff^4 * (4πR²). So when a fraction A of the area is covered by spots with temperature T_spot, the flux becomes F = (1 - A) * F_total + A * σT_spot^4.

So the change in flux is ΔF = F_spots_visible - F_normal.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are visible, the star's flux is F = F_total * (1 - A) + A * σT_spot^4. When the spots are not visible (other hemisphere), F is F_total.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be ΔF = F_normal - F_spots_visible.

F_normal is F_total.

F_spots_visible is F_total * (1 - A) + A * σT_spot^4.

So ΔF = F_total - [ F_total*(1 - A) + A σT_spot^4 ] = F_total * A (1 - (σT_spot^4 / F_total per unit area? Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of F_total.

Wait, F_total = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So the flux per unit area on the star is σ Teff^4.

So the flux from the spots is σ (Teff - 1000)^4 per unit area.

Thus, the total flux when spots are visible is:

F = (1 - A) * (σ Teff^4) * 4π R² + A * (σ (Teff - 1000)^4) * 4π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the total area of the star is 4π R². The spotted area is A * 4π R². So the flux is (1 - A) * σ Teff^4 * (4π R²) * (1) + A * σ (Teff - 1000)^4 * (4π R²).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The star's total flux is F = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When a fraction A of the surface is cooler, the flux becomes F' = F * (1 - A) + A * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4 * (4π R²) / (4π R²) ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the fractional change in flux.

So the fractional change ΔF/F is [ (F - F') ] / F.

F = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

F' = F * (1 - A) + A * (σ (Teff - ΔT)^4).

So F' = 4π R² σ [ (1 - A) Teff^4 + A (Teff - ΔT)^4 ].

Then, the fractional change is (F - F')/F = [ (1 - ( (1 - A) Teff^4 + A (Teff - ΔT)^4 )) ].

So, (F - F')/F = A [ 1 - (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ].

So the fractional change is A * [1 - ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ].

In this case, A is 0.1, Teff is 6000 K, ΔT is 1000 K.

So (Teff - ΔT)/Teff = 5000/6000 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^2 = ~0.6944. Then squared again: ~0.482.

So 1 - 0.482 ≈ 0.518.

So the fractional change is 0.1 * 0.518 ≈ 0.0518, or about 5.18% dip in brightness when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the dip is actually a decrease in brightness, so the amplitude is about 5.18% of the star's brightness.

Now, the question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet Rpl such that when it transits the star, the dip in brightness is the same amplitude, 5.18%.

The dip in brightness caused by a planet is (Rpl / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is π Rpl², and the star's area is π Rstar², so the fractional area is (Rpl / Rstar)^2.

Wait, but wait. When a planet transits a star, the dip is (Area of planet)/(Area of star) = (π Rpl²) / (π Rstar²) )= (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So to get a dip of 5.18%, we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ sqrt(0.05) ≈ 0.2236, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.0518 is about 0.0518. So sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Wait, but wait a minute. The dip due to the planet is (Rpl / Rstar)^2, but the dip due to the spots is 5.18%. So Rpl/Rstar should be sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277, which is about 0.23.

Looking at the options:

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, none of these options is around 0.23. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area comparison. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the fractional area of spots is 10% (A = 0.1). The temperature difference is 1000 K. So (6000-1000)/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 = let me compute more accurately.

0.8333^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

Then (0.6944)^2 = approx 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So the fractional change is 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, which is about 5.1775% dip.

So the planet's dip must be 5.1775% of the star's brightness. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Taking square root, Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the filling factor. Wait, the question says the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere.

Hemisphere area is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total star area is 4π R².

So the area fraction is 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1, which is 10% as before. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that when the spots are visible, the flux is F' = (1 - A) F + A F_spot.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because the star's flux is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

But wait, another approach: the differential brightness.

The maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (all the star's surface is at Teff), and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible (so 10% of the surface is at lower temperature).

So the maximum flux F_max = σ Teff^4 * 4π R².

The minimum flux F_min = ( (1 - A) * Teff^4 + A * (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) * σ * 4π R².

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Which is:

1 - [ (1 - A) Teff^4 + A (Teff - ΔT)^4 ] / Teff^4.

= 1 - (1 - A) - A [ (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ]

= A [ 1 - ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

Which is the same expression as before. So no mistake there.

So 0.1 [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ] = 0.1*(1- (625/1296)).

Wait, 625/1296 is approximately 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, or 5.1775%.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So Rpl/Rstar is sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, so approximately 0.23.

But the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of these is 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the entire hemisphere. Oh, wait, the star's brightness variation is when the spotted hemisphere is visible. The change is between when the spots are visible (low flux) and when not (high flux). So the amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_min.

Wait, but wait, when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere, the flux is lower. So the amplitude is F_max - F_min. The relative amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Which is what I computed as approximately 5.18%.

But the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_max.

So setting (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_max = (F_max - F_min).

Which gives (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (F_max - F_min)/F_max = 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

So approximately 0.23.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the star's temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are 5000 K.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (T_spot / Teff)^4 as (5000/6000)^4.

Let me compute that precisely.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by A=0.1: 0.0517747.

So the fractional change is ~5.177% as before.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is the same as what a planet would cause. So the amplitude is the same.

Hmm. Maybe I should think in terms of luminosity, not just area.

Wait, another approach: the flux from the star is L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4.

When a planet transits, it blocks an area of π Rpl^2. So the blocked flux is (π Rpl^2 / 4π Rstar^2 ) ) * (σ Teff^4) ) = (Rpl^2 / (4 Rstar^2)) ) * σ Teff^4.

So the dip is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) ) * ( σ Teff^4 ) / (4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4 ) ) → no, wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, when a planet transits, the dip is (Area of planet)/(Area of star), which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So to get the same dip as from the spots, which is 5.177%, set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 5.177% = 0.05177.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

But looking at the options, option D is 0.32, which is larger. Option C is 0.11, which is about 0.012, which would give (0.11)^2=0.0121 or 1.21% dip.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the star's luminosity change differently. The problem says the star's hemisphere has spots, but when the star is rotating, only part of the spots come into view. Wait, no, the problem states that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are all visible, leading to the dip. So the dip is 5.177% as calculated.

But perhaps the planet would need to cause the same dip, so Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, but the options do not have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let's recheck.

The problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. The Sun's radius is R_sun, but the problem says the star's R is same as the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun.

The problem says the star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.

Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere.

Hemisphere area: 2π Rstar².

Spot area: 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Total star area: 4π Rstar².

So fractional area: 0.4 π Rstar² / 4 π Rstar² = 0.1, as before.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the planet to cause the same amplitude as the spots, but in the opposite way. Because the spots cause a dip, but when the spots are on the other side, the star is brighter. So the amplitude is the maximum minus the minimum.

Wait, but when the spots are on the side, the star is less bright. So the amplitude is the difference between the maximum (unspotted) and minimum (spotted) brightness.

So if the planet causes a dip equal to that amplitude, then the planet's area must be the same as the area that is causing the dip.

Wait, but the dip from the spots is 5.177%, and the dip from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

So approximately 0.23. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the change in flux. Let me think about another approach.

Alternative approach: The brightness change is due to the change in the effective temperature as seen from Earth.

Wait, perhaps the star's flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f + f * (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4)) ), where f is the filling factor (0.1).

The fractional change is then F0 * [1 - f(1 - (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4)) ].

So the change is F0 * f [ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 ].

So the fractional change is f * [1 - (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4) ].

Which is the same as before.

So perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement to see if I missed anything.

Wait, the problem says that the star's one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². The star's entire area is 4π R², so 0.4π R² /4π R²= 0.1.

So all correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's light curve as the star rotates, and the spots cause a dip that's as if a planet is blocking a certain area. So perhaps the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is when the entire spot area is blocking, but the planet would block a circular area of the same area.

Wait, but the spot area is 10% of the star, which is 0.1.

So the planet's area (Rpl^2/Rstar^2) would have to be 0.1 for the dip to be the same.

Wait, no, because the dip from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So if the dip is 0.1 (10% of the star's area), then Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is ~0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the dip due to the spots is about 5.18%, not 10%. So why would the planet need to have a radius of 0.32 to cause a 10% dip, but our calculation says the dip is 5.18%, so the planet's radius would be 0.2275.

Wait, wait a minute. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip due to the spots. Because the spots are cooler, but the star's overall flux when the spots are visible is not just the area fraction times the difference in flux.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the flux from the spots. Let's recalculate the fractional change more accurately.

The star's flux without spots is F = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F' = 4π R² σ [ (1 - A) Teff^4 + A (Teff - ΔT)^4 ].

So the fractional change is (F - F')/F = (1 - [ (1 - A) Teff^4 + A (Teff - ΔT)^4 ]) / Teff^4.

Which is 1 - (1 - A) - A ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) = A [ 1 - ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) ].

So with A = 0.1, Teff = 6000 K, ΔT = 1000 K.

(Teff - ΔT) = 5000 K.

(5000/6000)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775.

So the fractional change is about 5.1775%.

But when a planet transits, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So to have the same dip, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. The closest options are C) ~0.11 (dip of ~1.21%) and D) ~0.32 (dip of ~0.1024, 10.24%).

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a circular area, not spread across a hemisphere. Or perhaps I misapplied the filling factor.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of a hemisphere. So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Star area is 4π R². So A = 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the spots rotate, so the maximum dip is when the planet appears to block the maximum number of spots. Wait, but the star's brightness when the spots are fully visible is the minimum, and when the other hemisphere is visible, it's the maximum.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the star's brightness varying between F_max and F_min, with the amplitude being F_max - F_min.

So the amplitude is 5.18% of F_max.

The planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_max.

So to have the same amplitude, we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F_max = F_max - F_min.

Which is the same as (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (F_max - F_min)/F_max = 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Again, no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's entire surface as being spotted, not just a hemisphere. But the question says only one hemisphere is spotty.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as similar to the planet's transit, but the planet would need to block a larger area to cause the same dip.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the flux change to the planet's flux change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are cooler, but the planet is a dark object, so the dip is the same as the area blocked. So perhaps the dip from the spots is higher because the spots are cooler, but no, the dip would be the same as the planet blocking a part of the star's disk.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The star's brightness change due to the spots is the same as the planet's brightness change when it transits. So the dip in brightness from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The dip from the spots is the same as that, so Rpl/Rstar must be sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 0.32, which is sqrt(0.1) (~0.316), which would correspond to a 10% dip. But our calculation says the dip is ~5.18%.

Another possibility: perhaps I should compute the effective area of the spots as seen from Earth.

Wait, when the star rotates, only part of the spots come into view. But the problem states that the entire hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all 10% of the star's surface is spots, leading to the dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's rotation period, but the question doesn't mention it, so I think it's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing luminosity with flux. Let me think again.

The star's luminosity is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the luminosity is L' = L * (1 - A) + A σ (Teff - ΔT)^4 * (4π R²) / (4π R²) ) → no, that's not correct. Because the area of the spots is A * 4π R², and each spot's flux is σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

Wait, the total flux from the star when spots are visible is:

F = F_total * (1 - A) + A * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

Where F_total = σ Teff^4.

So the dip is F_total - F = F_total * A [ 1 - ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) ].

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the options don't include the right value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is considering the average brightness change. Let's compute the ratio of the star's brightness with spots to without spots.

The star's flux when spots are visible is F' = F * (1 - A) + A * ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) ).

So F' = F [ (1 - A) + A ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) ) ].

The fractional change is (F - F')/F = A [ 1 - ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) ].

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 5.177%.

So the dip is 5.177% of the star's flux.

So the planet's transit must cause a dip of the same percentage, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the planet relative to the star's radius, but the star's radius is the same as the Sun, which is R_sun. So perhaps the exoplanet's radius is 0.2275 R_sun. But that's way larger than any known exoplanet. But the options are in the range of 0.07 to 0.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the star's temperature. Let me think again.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

Wait, perhaps the change in flux is (T_spot^4) / (Teff^4) = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So the flux from the spots is 0.48225 times the flux from the rest of the star.

So the star's flux when the spots are visible is (1 - A) * 1 + A * 0.48225 = 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.48225 = 0.9 + 0.048225 = 0.948225.

So the dip is 1 - 0.948225 = 0.051775, or 5.177%.

So the planet's radius would need to be such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the star is only showing part of the spotted hemisphere at any time. Wait, no, the problem states that the entire hemisphere is covered with spots, and when that hemisphere is facing us, all spots are visible. So the dip is maximal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the amplitude as the maximum minus the minimum, but perhaps I should think of the amplitude as the maximum dip, which is 5.177%.

In that case, the planet's radius would be as calculated.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the star's flux when the spots are visible and when they are not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the effective temperature of the spots as being 1000 K less than the star's, so Teff_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the flux per unit area of the spots is (5000/6000)^4 = 0.48225 of the star's flux.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 (1 - A) + A * 0.48225 F0, where F0 is the star's flux without spots.

So F = F0 [ (1 - A) + A * 0.48225 ].

The dip is F0 - F = F0 * [ 1 - ( (1 - A) + A * 0.48225 ) ] = F0 * [ A (1 - 0.48225) ] = F0 * A * 0.51775.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0.

Thus, the planet's radius must satisfy (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl ≈ 0.2275 Rstar.

So, again, same conclusion.

But the options don't have 0.23. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius to produce the same maximum dip, but the maximum dip would require the planet to block the same area as the spots.

Wait, for example, if the spots' area is 0.1 Rstar², then the planet's area would need to be 0.1 Rstar², leading to Rpl = sqrt(0.1) Rstar ≈ 0.316 Rstar, which is option D.

But this would correspond to a dip of 10%, but our calculation shows the dip is 5.177%.

So perhaps the problem is considering the planet's radius to block the same area as the spots, not the same dip. But that would not match the dip in brightness.

Wait, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area blocked, but also depends on the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the planet to block the same amount of flux as the spots. So the planet would need to block a fraction A of the star's area, but because the spots are cooler, their effect is smaller.

So, perhaps the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, and the spots cause a dip of A [1 - (Teff_spot^4 / Teff^4)].

So to have the same dip, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = A [1 - ( (Teff_spot^4)/(Teff^4) ) ].

In that case, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Again, same result.

So I think my calculation is correct. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121) ≈ 0.11, but that would correspond to a dip of 1.21%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the planet's radius to cause the same amplitude as the star's own brightness variation, which includes both the spots and the unspotted area.

Wait, but the problem states that the photometric variations resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude is the dip from the spots, which is 5.177%.

So the planet's radius must cause a dip of 5.177%, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 0.32, which is the sqrt(0.1) as before.

But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's entire surface as being covered by spots, but the question says only one hemisphere.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the planet to cause a dip equal to the star's average brightness variation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is taking into account the spot's filling factor per hemisphere, but the planet's area is for the entire star.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change.

Wait, let me compute (5/6)^4 precisely.

5/6 = 0.8333333.

0.8333333^4 = ?

0.8333333^2 = 0.6944444.

0.6944444^2 = 0.482253.

So yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is approximately 0.23, but it's not one of the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) 0.32, which is sqrt(0.1), but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot area as a fraction of the entire star, not just a hemisphere. So A = 0.2, not 0.1.

Wait, if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then A would be 0.2.

In that case, the fractional change would be 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355, or 10.355% dip.

Then, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32, option D.

But the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun and one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spot area is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.1 of the star's total area.

So unless the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, which would make A=0.2, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32, which is option D.

But the question clearly states the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so A=0.1.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but if I have to choose from the given options, the closest would be option D) 0.32, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think once more.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as it rotates, and the area of the spots as seen from Earth changes. But the problem states that the entire hemisphere is spotty, so when that hemisphere is visible, all the spots are visible, leading to the maximum dip.

So I think my initial approach is correct.

In conclusion, the correct Rpl/Rstar is approximately 0.2275, which is not among the options. But perhaps the intended answer is option D) 0.32, which would correspond to a dip of 10.24%, which is about twice the dip we calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the dip using more precise numbers.

Let me compute (5/6)^4 exactly.

5/6 = 0.8333333333.

0.8333333333^4 = ?

Compute 0.8333333333^2 = 0.6944444444.

0.6944444444^2 = 0.4822530864.

So 1 - 0.4822530864 = 0.5177469136.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.05177469136.

So the dip is 5.177469136%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177469136.

Taking square root:

sqrt(0.05177469136) = 0.2275.

So about 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~0.32.

But I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C) ~0.11, which would correspond to a dip of about 1.21%, which is much smaller than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the dip is 10%, but I'm not seeing where.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's flux when the spots are visible as F' = F * (1 - A * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) ), which would be a different approach.

Let me compute that.

F' = F * (1 - A * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) )

So the dip is F - F' = F * A * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer is approximately 0.23, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) 0.32, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. So A=0.2.

In that case, the dip would be 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ] = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 → 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. In that case, option D would be correct.

But the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So A=0.1.

But given the options, the intended answer might be D) 0.32, based on A=0.2.

So, perhaps the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \) (i.e., \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).

2. **Spot Area**:
   - The filling factor of 20% refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots.
   - Hemisphere area: \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - Spot area: \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - Fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots:  
     \[
     A = \frac{\text{Spot area}}{\text{Total star area}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \, \text{(10% of the star's surface)}.
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots:  
     \[
     F_{\text{total}} = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
     \]
   - When spots are visible, the flux is reduced due to their lower temperature:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spots\_visible}} = (1 - A) F_{\text{total}} + A \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4.
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux (dip in brightness) is:  
     \[
     \Delta F/F = A \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right].
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \Delta F/F = 0.1 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right].
     \]
     - \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \).
     - \( \Delta F/F = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775 \, \text{(5.1775% dip)}.

4. **Exoplanet's Radius**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \Delta F/F.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{\Delta F/F} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (~0.39)**: This corresponds to a much larger dip (approximately 15.5%), which is inconsistent with the calculated dip of 5.177%.
- **Option B (~0.07)**: This corresponds to a dip of about 1.21%, which is much smaller than the calculated dip.
- **Option C (~0.11)**: This corresponds to a dip of about 1.21%, which is also much smaller than the calculated dip.
- **Option D (~0.32)**: This corresponds to a dip of approximately 10.24%. While this is larger than the calculated dip, it is the closest option provided. It may reflect an assumption that the filling factor applies to the entire star (20% of the total surface area, \( A = 0.2 \)), leading to a larger dip:
  \[
  \Delta F/F = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.10355 \, \text{(10.355% dip)}.
  \]
  - In this case:
    \[
    \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218 \, \text{(0.32)}.
    \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated dip based on the problem's description is approximately 5.177%, corresponding to \( R_{\text{pl}}/R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2275 \). However, this value is not among the provided options. The closest option is **D (~0.32)**, which may assume the filling factor applies to the entire star rather than just one hemisphere. Therefore, the intended answer is:

**Answer: D**
