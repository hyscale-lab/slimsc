Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I remember that bromine is a halogen and often acts as an electrophile in reactions. So, I think this is an addition reaction, probably on a double bond. 

Wait, wait, the molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Hmm, cyclopent-1-enol is a cyclopentene ring with an -OH group. The numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl is on carbon 1? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond starting at C1, so C1 and C2 are double-bonded, and the OH is on C1. But wait, that might not make sense because if the double bond is between C1 and C2, the OH is on C1, so maybe it's an enol structure. Enols are compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups, right?

But wait, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol—so the cyclopentene ring has substituents. The substituents are two methyl groups on the 4-position. So the ring is numbered such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, the OH is on C1, and the two methyl groups are on C4.

So when bromine reacts with this enol, what happens? I think bromine adds across the double bond in an electrophilic addition. But wait, the enol also has an OH group. Could there be some kind of conjugate addition or maybe some kind of ring opening?

Wait, but in enol ethers or similar structures, sometimes reactions can proceed differently because of the adjacent groups. But in this case, it's an enol, which is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So maybe the reaction is an addition of Br2.

But wait, bromine can also undergo some other reactions, like oxidation. Oh, wait, the enol has an -OH group, which is acidic. Maybe the reaction isn't just a simple addition but involves some kind of oxidation or ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is similar to the bromination of an alkene. I remember that bromine adds across double bonds in a dibromide, leading to vicinal dihalides. But in this case, the starting material is an enol, which is adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but cyclopent-1-enol has the structure where C1 has OH and a double bond to C2. So the molecule is an enol, which can tautomerize to a keto form. But in the presence of a double bond, maybe the bromine would add to the double bond.

So if Br2 adds to the double bond, the positions where the Br adds would be C1 and C2. But wait, since the ring is cyclopentene, adding Br across the double bond would give a bromocyclopentane derivative.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol. So adding Br2 would lead to 1,2-dibromocyclopentanol? But the substituents are 4,4-dimethyl, so the product might have Br on C1 and C2 and methyl on C4.

Looking at the options, options A and D are diols with Br on 1 and 2. Options B and C are mono-brominated products, but as ketones.

Wait, so perhaps the enol is actually undergoing some oxidation. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another possibility is that the enol is reacting in a different way. Maybe the OH group is deprotonated, making the enolate, which could then react with Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol can form a cyclic bromonium ion when Br2 adds. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: when enols react with halogens like Br2, sometimes they can undergo a conjugate addition, adding across the double bond but in a conjugated manner. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the starting material again. The molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl is on C1. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with substituents: two methyl groups on C4 and an -OH on C1.

Now, when bromine (Br2) is added, it's a di-electrophile. So the double bond would react with Br2 in an addition reaction. The bromine will add across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide.

But wait, the presence of the hydroxyl group—does that affect the addition? I think in some cases, the enol can lead to an anti addition because of the ring's structure. But I'm not sure.

So adding Br across C1 and C2 would give a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S) and D is (1R,2R). So the stereochemistry matters here.

Wait, but the starting enol's configuration—what is the geometry of the double bond? If it's a cyclopentene, the substituents are in a certain arrangement. The addition of Br2 can be either anti or not, but in a ring structure, the addition might be constrained.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol can undergo an oxidation reaction. Wait, another possibility: when an enol reacts with a halogen, it can form a bromoketone. Wait, how does that happen?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that enols can undergo oxidation. For example, in the presence of an oxidizing agent, the enol might form a ketone. But Br2 isn't typically an oxidizing agent for that; maybe in some conditions.

Wait, but another thought: when an enol reacts with bromine, a possible reaction is the formation of a dibromide, but sometimes, if the enol is in a particular position, the reaction can lead to a bromohydrin. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is converted into a carbocation upon attack by Br2, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the enol's ability to form a bromonium ion. Let me think: when Br2 adds to a double bond, it forms a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate, which then opens up with a nucleophile. In this case, the enol's hydroxyl group could act as a nucleophile.

Wait, that's an interesting point. So Br2 adds to the double bond, forming a bromonium ion. Then, the hydroxyl group (which is a poor nucleophile but maybe in such a strained ring, it could attack) would open the bromonium ion, leading to an alcohol with Br attached.

Wait, but the ring is cyclopentane, which is strained, so maybe the ring can open. Hmm, but I'm not sure that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the enol can undergo bromination as an electrophilic addition without any ring opening, leading to the vicinal dibromide. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But wait, looking at the options, options A and D are 1,2-dibromo products. The difference is in the stereochemistry. The other options are mono-bromo.

Wait, but why would the product be a mono-brominated product? Unless the reaction isn't an addition but instead an oxidation.

Another possibility: the enol could undergo oxidation to form a ketone, and then bromination. Wait, but the starting material is an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone.

Wait, if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then the ketone would undergo bromination where? Bromine typically adds to double bonds, but if the ketone is present, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the most likely reaction between an enol and bromine. I remember that enols can undergo dihalogenation. So Br2 would add across the double bond, giving a vicinal dihalide. But in this case, the ring is small, so the addition might lead to some ring strain.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, adding Br across the double bond would produce a cyclopentane ring with two adjacent Br atoms. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But looking at the options, options A and D are such products. The difference is the stereochemistry. Are the Br atoms added in a cis or trans fashion?

Wait, the addition of Br2 to a double bond is typically anti. So in the cyclopentene, the two bromines would add to opposite sides, leading to a trans diastereomer. But wait, the ring's structure might influence this. Alternatively, for the cyclopentene, which is a five-membered ring, the addition could lead to a specific stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a bromohydrin, but that would involve adding one Br and an OH group, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but the starting material has an -OH group on C1. So when Br2 adds to the double bond, the OH is adjacent to the site of addition. So after addition, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH is still on C1.

Wait, but that can't be. Because C1 would have both Br and OH? That would mean substitution, but the starting material has C1 as part of the double bond, so adding Br would mean that C1 is now bonded to Br and OH.

Wait, perhaps that's possible. So the product would be 1-bromo-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, but the positions of the Brs are 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of a ring opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the enol has an -OH group adjacent to the double bond. When bromine adds to the double bond, could the OH group attack the bromonium ion, leading to a substitution?

Wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is deprotonated, making the enolate, which then reacts with Br2.

No, wait, enolates are more about nucleophilic reactions, but Br2 is an electrophilic reagent. So perhaps the enolate would attack Br2.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options again. Options A and D are diastereomers, both 1,2-dibromo. So the question is about the stereochemistry.

Wait, the starting material is cyclopent-1-enol, which is a cyclopentene ring. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The addition of Br2 would proceed with anti addition because Br adds across in a trans fashion. So the two Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But in a cyclopentane ring, the trans addition would result in how the substituents are arranged. Let me imagine the ring: after addition, the Brs would be on opposite faces, but in a five-membered ring, that might lead to a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but when the Br2 adds, the two Br atoms add across the double bond. So the initial diene becomes a dibromide. The stereochemistry would depend on whether the reaction is concerted or forms a bromonium ion intermediate.

If it's concerted, the addition would be anti, leading to a trans-dibromide. But in a ring, the trans might be more or less possible depending on ring size. For cyclopropane, it's impossible, but cyclopentane is a bit larger.

Wait, but considering the chair-like transition state, the addition of Br2 would place the Brs on opposite sides. So the resulting molecule would have the Brs on opposite positions, leading to a trans configuration.

But wait, in a five-membered ring, the positions are such that if you have Brs on C1 and C2, their positions would be on adjacent carbons, and the ring would have to accommodate that.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a vicinal dibromide with the Brs on adjacent carbons in a trans configuration. So looking at the structures, options A and D are 1,2-dibromo with different stereochemistry.

Option A is (1R,2S), which would be a trans configuration because the substituents on adjacent carbons are opposite. Option D is (1R,2R), which would be a cis configuration.

But wait, depends on how the Brs add. If the addition is anti, then the Brs would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans arrangement. So in cyclopentane, that would mean the Brs are on opposite faces, leading to a certain diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's structure makes the addition proceed with a certain stereochemistry.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the major product is a vicinal dibromide. So among the options, options A and D are dibromides. So the answer would be either A or D.

Now, looking at the stereochemistry.

In the starting material, the enol is in a certain configuration. Let's imagine the cyclopentene ring. C1 has the OH group and the double bond to C2. The ring is arranged such that the substituents are in a certain position. When Br adds, it could be either in a way that the Brs are cis or trans across the ring.

Wait, perhaps the initial addition of Br2 to the double bond would form a trans dibromide. So the Brs would be on opposite sides, leading to the (1R,2S) configuration in option A.

But wait, how does the configuration come about? Let me think about the structure.

Assuming the starting enol is in a certain configuration. Let's say the OH is on the same face as the double bond. When Br2 adds, the Brs would add from opposite faces, leading to a trans arrangement.

So the product would have Brs on opposite sides. Hence, when looking at the molecule, the Br on C1 and C2 are on opposite faces.

So the two Brs would each be on opposite sides—so R and S configurations.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers would form, but the question is about the major outcome.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction leads to a bromohydrin, but that's when adding water as a nucleophile. But in this case, the enol has the OH group, so perhaps the bromonium ion opens with the OH group, leading to a bromohydrin. But then the product would have an additional OH.

Wait, but the starting material already has an OH. If the OH is used in the nucleophilic attack, then perhaps the product would have two Brs and another OH, but that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is deprotonated, making the enolate, which then attacks the Br2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed via addition but via some kind of substitution. But I don't think that's the case here.

Another thought: could the enol undergo oxidation with Br2? Sometimes, in certain conditions, enols can be oxidized to ketones. But I'm not sure if Br2 is a strong enough oxidizing agent for that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the major outcome is the formation of a bromoketone. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition. But the enol is already a conjugated system. So perhaps the Br adds to the carbonyl group. But wait, the starting material is an enol, not a ketone. So the position of the carbonyl is not present in the enol form.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structures. Looking at options:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

So options A and D are diols with dibromide, B and C are ketones with mono-bromide.

So, is the reaction more likely to result in a diol with dibromide (A or D) or a ketone with one Br (B or C)?

Wait, if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then the ketone would have a carbonyl group. Then, bromine could add across the carbonyl group, but that's not typical. Alternatively, the ketone might undergo a different reaction.

Wait, but wait. Bromine can also react with ketones in some cases, like in the presence of an enol. I'm a bit hazy here. Maybe the enol attacks Br2, leading to the substitution of the OH with a Br, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's hydroxyl group participates in the addition reaction, leading to a bromide in a different position.

Wait, another angle: maybe the enol's structure directs the bromine to add in a certain way. For example, the OH group is adjacent to the double bond, so the addition of Br2 could lead to a bromide on the same carbon as the OH.

Wait, but in the addition, the Brs add to the double bond carbons. So C1 would have Br and OH, and C2 would have Br. But how can a carbon have two Brs? No, each carbon in the double bond would get one Br.

Wait, no. Each Br would add to each carbon in the double bond. So C1 and C2 each get a Br.

So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH remains on C1.

Wait, but then that carbon (C1) would have both Br and OH groups attached. Is that feasible? I think so, because each is a substituent on the same carbon. So the structure would have C1 with Br, OH, and two other bonds (like two CH2 groups in the ring? Or perhaps more substituted).

But looking at the options, the diols have Br on C1 and C2, with the OH on C1. So that makes sense.

So the major product is either A or D, which are 1,2-dibromo with OH on C1.

Now, the question is about the stereochemistry. How would the Brs add?

In the addition of bromine to a double bond, the Brs add anti to each other. So if the starting enol is in a certain configuration, the Brs would be added on opposite sides.

But in a ring structure, the anti addition could lead to a specific diastereomer. For a cyclopentane ring, the addition of Brs in an anti fashion would result in a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's structure doesn't allow for free rotation, so the Brs are added in a trans configuration, leading to the (1R,2S) or (1S,2R) configuration.

Wait, but how would that translate to the options given? Option A is (1R,2S), which would be a trans arrangement, and option D is (1R,2R), which is cis.

So, since the addition is anti, the Brs would be trans, so the product would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R) configuration. Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which would be the trans configuration.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think about it: in a cyclopentene, when you add Br2, the Brs add with anti stereochemistry leading to the two Brs being on opposite faces of the ring.

So, the product would have the Brs in a trans configuration. So whether it's (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), but the options only have (1R,2S) and (1R,2R).

Wait, but the starting material's configuration—does the enol have any specific stereochemistry? The question states 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The position of the methyl groups might influence the addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is planar, and the addition of Br2 can proceed from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But the options don't include that; instead, they have specific configurations.

Wait, perhaps the ring's substituents influence the addition's stereochemistry. The two methyl groups on C4 are bulky, so they might influence where the Br adds.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed with high stereoselectivity, and the major product is a racemic mixture. But the options don't have a racemic option; they have specific configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a specific configuration due to steric effects. For example, the methyl groups on C4 are on the same side, so the addition would be from the opposite face, leading to a certain configuration.

But without a clear image, this is getting a bit too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a diol but a ketone with a bromide. Let's think again: if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then bromine could add to the carbonyl group. But wait, adding bromine to a carbonyl group would usually require a different condition, like in a bromohydrin reaction, but that's with water.

Wait, another possibility: if the enol is oxidized to a ketone, then bromine could add to the carbonyl group. But I don't think Br2 is a strong oxidizing agent for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's OH group is involved in a substitution reaction. But I don't think so, as Br2 is more of an electrophilic addition agent.

Wait, but looking back at the options, options B and C are ketones. So if the enol forms a ketone, and then a bromine adds, perhaps in a conjugated position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. Let me think: in an enone system, bromine can add in a conjugate fashion. But in this case, the starting material isn't a ketone; it's an enol.

Wait, but if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then the conjugate addition would be possible. So if the enol becomes a cyclopentanone, then bromine could add in a conjugate position, leading to a bromide in the alpha position.

But wait, where would that be? The ketone is at C1, as the enol tautomerizes to cyclopentan-1-one. Then, adding Br in a conjugate position would be at C2 or C5 (but numbering depends on where the double bond is after tautomerization). Hmm, getting a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromoketone. If the enol reacts with Br2 in such a way that the OH is replaced by Br, but that would require a substitution reaction, which is less likely with Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol attacks Br2, leading to the formation of a bromide on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the enol's OH group is a good leaving group, but that's not common unless under specific conditions. But I don't recall Br2 being used for such substitutions.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again. The main possibilities are adding Br2 to the double bond (giving a diol with two Brs) or the enol converting to a ketone and then adding Br somewhere else.

Between the options, the diol options (A and D) suggest an addition, while the ketone options (B and C) suggest a different pathway.

But I'm more confident that Br2 adds across the double bond in an addition reaction, leading to a vicinal dibromide. So the product would be a diol with two Brs.

Now, which of the options A or D is correct?

If the addition is anti, leading to a trans diastereomer, then option A is (1R,2S), which is a trans configuration. So that would be the case if the addition is anti.

Alternatively, if the addition leads to a cis configuration, that would be option D, (1R,2R).

But I think the addition of bromine to double bonds is generally anti. So the product would have the Brs on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration.

But in a cyclopentane ring, the anti addition might be constrained, leading to a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the chair-like transition state for the addition would lead to the Brs being on opposite faces, leading to the (1R,2S) configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is A.

But another thought: when adding Br2 to a cyclopentene, the ring's strain might influence the product. Since cyclopentane is less strained than cyclopropane, but the addition of Brs would add more substituents, making the ring even more strained.

Wait, but in this case, the addition of Brs would make the ring less likely to open, so it's more likely to form the dibromide.

Hmm. I'm trying to decide between A and D.

Wait, wait. If the addition is anti, then the two Brs are on opposite sides. So looking at the cyclopentane ring, if C1 and C2 are adjacent, and each has a Br, then their arrangement would be trans.

So for C1 (R configuration) and C2 (S configuration), that would be option A (1R,2S). Alternatively, if both are R, that's option D.

But how do the configurations work when adding Brs anti?

Let me imagine the starting enol. Let's say the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the OH on C1. The ring is such that when Br2 adds, the Brs add on opposite sides.

The starting enol's geometry: if the OH is on the same side as one of the substituents, the Brs would add from the opposite side.

Wait, perhaps a model would help, but since I can't build it, I'll have to visualize.

But without the exact model, I'll proceed with the assumption that the addition is anti, leading to a trans configuration, which corresponds to option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which is a trans arrangement, and option D is (1R,2R), which is cis.

So if the addition is anti, the product would be trans, so option A.

But wait, another point: the enol's configuration. If the enol is in the s-cis conformation, then addition of Br2 would lead to a certain stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction goes via a bromonium ion, which can open on either side. But again, without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is option B or C, which are ketones with bromide. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another thought: the enol could undergo oxidation to form a ketone. So if the enol converts to cyclopentanone, then bromine could add to the carbonyl group, but that's unlikely without a catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds to the carbonyl group, but I don't think that's a typical reaction.

Another possibility is that the enol's OH is a good nucleophile, and it attacks the bromonium ion formed by the double bond and Br2. But in that case, the Br would add to the other side.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I think the most likely scenario is that Br2 adds to the double bond, leading to a vicinal dihalide, with the OH remaining on C1. So among the options, the diols are A and D.

So, I think the correct answer is either A or D, depending on the stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe the product is (1R,2R), which would be option D. How?

Because in a five-membered ring, the anti addition might not be possible, leading to a cis addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's strain leads to a syn addition, making the Brs add on the same side.

Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps the ring's structure favors a syn addition in this case, leading to a cis configuration.

In that case, the product would have the Brs on the same side, leading to (1R,2R) configuration, which is option D.

Hmm. I'm not confident, but I'll go with option A if the addition is anti or option D if it's syn.

Wait, another approach: think about the oxidation state. Adding Br2 to the double bond doesn't change the oxidation state, so the product remains an alcohol with Brs. So options A and D are alcohols with Brs. So that's more likely than the ketones.

So I'll go with either A or D.

But how to decide the stereochemistry.

In the addition of Br2 to a double bond, the Brs add with anti stereochemistry. So the initial bromonium ion forms, and then the ring opens with the Brs adding opposite each other.

In a cyclopentene, the ring is not as strained as cyclopropane, so the anti addition is feasible.

Thus, the product would have Brs in a trans configuration. So if the molecule is viewed such that C1 is R and C2 is S, that would be option A.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a cis configuration because of the ring's constraints.

Wait, another way: imagine the cyclopentene with the double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would form a bromonium ion, which then opens to add Brs. The opening can occur from either face, but in a ring, the transition state would have the Brs on opposite faces.

So the product would have the Brs on opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration.

So the product would be (1R,2S), which is option A.

Wait, but another thing: the starting material's configuration. If the enol is in a certain configuration, the addition could lead to a specific diastereomer.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a racemic mixture, but that's not indicated here.

But the question doesn't specify the starting material's stereochemistry, so perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that.

So, perhaps the major product is (1R,2S), which is option A.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't proceed via anti addition but via some other mechanism, leading to a cis product.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol's hydroxyl group is involved in the attack, leading to a different outcome.

But I think the most straightforward reaction is the addition of Br2 across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide with anti stereochemistry, so option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which is an enol with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C1. Bromine (Br₂) is a halogen that typically reacts with double bonds through electrophilic addition, forming a vicinal dibromide. The key consideration is whether the addition occurs with anti (trans) or syn (cis) stereochemistry.

In the case of cyclopentene derivatives, the addition of Br₂ generally proceeds with anti stereochemistry, as the bromine atoms add to opposite sides of the double bond. This is due to the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate, which allows for anti addition when the ring opens. The resulting product would have bromine atoms on C1 and C2 in a trans configuration.

The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, and the bulky methyl groups on C4 do not significantly influence the stereochemistry of the addition. The product will retain the hydroxyl group on C1, along with the two bromine atoms on C1 and C2. Among the given options, the stereochemistry of the product corresponds to the (1R,2S) configuration, which matches option A.

Options B and C involve ketones with a single bromine atom, which would require the enol to tautomerize to a ketone and undergo a different reaction pathway. However, the reaction conditions described (reaction with Br₂) favor direct addition to the double bond, making options B and C less likely. Option D represents a cis configuration of the bromine atoms, which is inconsistent with the anti addition mechanism.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is the formation of (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.
