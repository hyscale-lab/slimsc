Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which of the listed symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I should recall what these symmetries are. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the theory looks the same under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, meaning the theory is invariant under the Poincare group, which is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. So, if a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry because Poincare is a larger group.

Then there's CP symmetry, which is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). CPT symmetry is the combination of C, P, and T (time reversal). I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry; that is, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. So, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory.

Wait, but what about CP symmetry? Do operators in SMEFT necessarily respect CP? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. SMEFT includes all possible operators that are consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, right? The Standard Model itself doesn't have CP symmetry (except in some specific cases), but the effective operators can have terms that violate CP if they are allowed by the symmetry structure.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if a symmetry is a necessary requirement, then the operators must respect it regardless of the model.

Wait, the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so SMEFT, being an effective theory built from it, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) is correct. Poincare symmetry (2) is more general, including translations. But do the SMEFT operators necessarily respect Poincare? Because the SMEFT is constructed as a theory with a cutoff, but the operators are built from the SM fields. Wait, but if the theory is constructed to allow all possible operators consistent with the SM, does that include Poincare?

Wait, no. SMEFT is built in a way that the operators are written down respecting the symmetries of the SM. The SM is Poincare-invariant, so the operators must respect Poincare as well. Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. So if the operators are part of an effective theory that's a valid extension, then they must respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but wait, are there cases where an operator might not respect Poincare? I'm not sure. Maybe the operators are constructed with the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare, so each operator must respect Poincare.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because the Standard Model is. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2). So options 1 and 2 are correct. Then, what about CPT symmetry (4) and CP (3)?

CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT. So all operators must respect CPT (4) as well. So 1,2,4 are correct.

What about CP (3)? The SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry unless the operators are CP-even. But the operators can have terms that violate CP if needed. For example, some dimension-6 operators do violate CP. But the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if a symmetry doesn't have to be respected, then it's not a required symmetry for all operators.

So the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). CP (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators. So the correct combination is 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is option C) 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because it extends the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model, and SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory and is automatically respected by any Lorentz-invariant theory. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not universally required.
