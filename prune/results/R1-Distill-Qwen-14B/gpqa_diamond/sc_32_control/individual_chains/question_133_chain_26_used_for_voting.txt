Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains potassium hydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4·2H2O). Both have 1.00 grams each, and the volume is 200 cm³. The temperature is 25°C, and they gave me the pKa values for H3PO4. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? But in solution, phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, maybe these are part of a buffer solution. Oh right, KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-, so they're adjacent in the phosphate ion series.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it dissociates in three steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. The third is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. But the K values are given as Ka1, Ka2, Ka3, which are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid-base pairs (with Ka2), this must be a buffer solution. So, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. Once I have the pH, I can see which form of phosphate is predominant and calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-). Hmm, but under normal circumstances, especially with pH around the second dissociation, PO4^3- might be minimal. Maybe I need to calculate the exact concentration using the given K values and the concentrations of the buffer components.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.
2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Use the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) to find the pH.
4. Determine the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 expression.

Wait, but wait a second. PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12. So, the concentration of PO4^3- will be based on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH.

Alternatively, since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH will be around the second pKa (pKa2). Let's compute that first.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. 

Calculating the moles:

For KH2PO4:
Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.

The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.200 L. 

Concentrations:
[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.036715 M.
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.02809 M.

Now apply Henderson-Hasselbalch:
pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, let me compute that: log(6.2) is about 0.792, and 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 1e-8. So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = 7.207. Let me confirm with a calculator.

So, log([base]/[acid]) = log(0.02809 / 0.036715) = log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.115 ≈ 7.092.

Now, this pH is where the second dissociation is in effect. But we are looking for PO4^3-, which involves the third dissociation. So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the third dissociation.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74. Wait, that's way higher than the pH we have (7.09).

Wait, but if the pH is lower than pKa3, then HPO4^2- will be the predominant form. Because the solution is acidic, so the HPO4^2- is more than PO4^3-.

Hmm, so the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low because the pH is much lower than pKa3. But let's quantify it.

The expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. So to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

We need [H+], which is 1e-pH. pH is 7.092, so [H+] = 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Wait, wait, 10^-7.092 = approximately 8.21e-8. Because 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.092 is about 0.821. So yes, 1e-7 * 0.821 = 8.21e-8.

So, plugging in the numbers: [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / (8.21e-8)

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, as calculated earlier.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.21e-8.

Let me compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.056e-14.

Denominator: 8.21e-8.

So, 5.056e-14 / 8.21e-8 = approximately 6.16e-7 M.

Wait, but let me compute the exact numbers.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 1.8 * 0.02809 * 1e-12 = 0.050562 * 1e-12 = 5.0562e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.0562e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0562 / 8.21) * 1e-6.

5.0562 / 8.21 ≈ 0.616.

So, 0.616e-6 = 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Maybe my approximation has some error.

Wait, let me recheck the pH calculation. Because I used [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] as 0.02809 and 0.036715 respectively. Their ratio is 0.02809/0.036715 ≈ 0.765.

Wait, log(0.765) is log(7.65e-1) = log(7.65) + log(1e-1) = 0.884 -1 = -0.116. So pH = pKa2 + (-0.116) = 7.207 - 0.116 = 7.091.

So [H+] is 10^-7.091. Let me compute that more accurately.

7.091 is the pH. So [H+] = 10^-7.091 ≈ 8.18e-8 M.

So, using more precise numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 mol/L.

[H+] = 8.18e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.18e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Divide by 8.18e-8: 5.0562e-14 / 8.18e-8 = (5.0562 / 8.18) * 1e-6.

5.0562 / 8.18 ≈ let's compute that: 8.18 goes into 5.056 how many times?

8.18 * 0.6 is 4.908. 5.056 -4.908=0.148. So 0.6 + 0.148/8.18 ≈ 0.6 + 0.018 ≈ 0.618.

So 0.618e-6 = 6.18e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is actually a buffer, and the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, but let's think again.

Wait, another approach: The solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third ionization.

But considering that the pH is 7.09, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74), so the solution is in the range where HPO4^2- is mostly un-ionized. So, the concentration of PO4^3- should be very low.

So, the [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+].

Wait, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precise values.

Let me compute the exact [H+].

pH = 7.092 → [H+] = 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092) = 1e-7 * 0.818 ≈ 8.18e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.18e-8) = (5.0562e-14) / (8.18e-8) ≈ 6.18e-7 M.

So the answer should be approximately 6.18e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But I'm not seeing another option around that value except option A.

Wait, wait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps I can consider the exact calculation of [H+] and exact ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the buffer. Wait, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So their concentrations are from KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, respectively.

Wait, but for the buffer, I should have considered that H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch holds: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

Another possible mistake: I might have used the wrong moles. Let me recalculate the moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. 1g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007343 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so 0.007343 / 0.2 = 0.036715 M H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1g / 177.99 = approx 0.005618 mol. In 0.2 L, that's 0.02809 M HPO4^2-.

So the ratio is 0.02809 / 0.036715 = approx 0.765.

pKa2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.765) → log(0.765)= approx -0.115. So pH=7.207 -0.115=7.092.

All right, that's correct.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.18e-8) = (5.056e-14) /8.18e-8 = 6.18e-7 M.

So the closest option is A) 6.24e-7 M. 

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7. Did I make a mistake? Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate [PO4^3-] using the exact expression from the third dissociation. Let me write the equilibrium again.

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the values:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M.

[H+] = 1e-7.092 ≈ 8.18e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.18e-8) → (5.056e-14) / 8.18e-8 = 6.18e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.18e-7, which rounds to 6.2e-7. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- isn't just 0.02809 M because some of it can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But in reality, since the pH is much lower than pKa3, the amount of PO4^3- formed is negligible, so the assumption that [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.02809 M is valid. So the calculation should be correct.

Therefore, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.18e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M). But wait, the given options don't have exactly 6.18e-7. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, another possible mistake: perhaps I should account for the fact that some of the HPO4^2- is converted into PO4^3- and H+. But since Ka3 is very small, this is minimal, so the approximation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact value without rounding early. Let me compute more precisely.

Compute [H+] as 10^-7.092.

7.092 is 7 + 0.092.

10^-7 is 1e-7.

10^-0.092 = antilog(-0.092) = 1/(10^0.092). 10^0.092 is approximately 1.236. So 1/1.236 ≈ 0.8095.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8095 ≈ 8.095e-8 M.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.095e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.056e-14.

Divide by 8.095e-8 → 5.056e-14 /8.095e-8 = (5.056/8.095) * 1e-6.

5.056 / 8.095 ≈ 0.625.

So 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 M.

Ah, now that's 6.25e-7 M, which is closer to option A: 6.24e-7 M. So that's the right answer.

Wait, but wait: when I compute 5.056 / 8.095, let me compute it more accurately.

5.056 ÷ 8.095.

8.095 × 0.625 = 5.059375. So 8.095 × 0.625 = 5.059375. But our numerator is 5.056.

So 5.056 is just a bit less than 5.059375. So 0.625 × (5.056/5.059375) = approximately 0.625 × (0.9997) ≈ 0.6248.

So 0.6248e-6 M → 6.248e-7 M, which is 6.25e-7 when rounded to four significant figures.

So the concentration is approximately 6.25e-7 M, which is very close to option A: 6.24e-7 M.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, with a total volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided as Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol  
  Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol  
  Concentration = 0.007343 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.036715 M (H₂PO₄⁻)

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol  
  Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol  
  Concentration = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M (HPO₄²⁻)

### Step 2: Determine the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The buffer system consists of H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant dissociation constant is Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, so:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.02809}{0.036715}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the third dissociation step:  
\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄}^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]
The expression for Ka₃ is:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄}^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for [\text{PO₄}^{3-}]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
- \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \)  
- \( [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = 0.02809 \, \text{M} \)  
- \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.18 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \)

Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.18 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.18 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.18 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.18 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**.

Answer: A
