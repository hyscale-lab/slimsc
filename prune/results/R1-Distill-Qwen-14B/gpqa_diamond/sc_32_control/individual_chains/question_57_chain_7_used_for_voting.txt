Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to remember.

First, I think phase shifts are important in scattering theory. Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of these phase shifts. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is something like the sum over l of (something with phase shifts and spherical harmonics). Wait, more specifically, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam (which would be θ=0 degrees) involves the sum of the tangent of the phase shifts.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. For the forward direction (θ=0), I remember that the imaginary part is related to the sum of the phase shifts. Oh right! The formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ tan(δ_l) * (2l+1), but wait, isn't there another factor? Hmm, maybe k is the wave number.

Wait, but in the problem, they give the phase shifts δ0, δ1, ..., δ4. They said to ignore the rest, so I'm supposed to sum from l=0 to l=4. So the formula would be Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) * tan(δ_l). 

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have mixed up the formula. Alternatively, I remember that the total cross-section is given by the sum over l of ( (2l + 1) * |f_l|^2 ), but that's for the cross-section. But since the question is about the imaginary part, maybe I'm on the right track.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l ( (2l+1) (i^l) (tan δ_l - i) P_l^m (cosθ) ) / ( sqrt(4π) (2l + 1) ) ), but maybe I'm complicating things too much. 

Alternatively, I think that for the forward direction, the imaginary part simplifies. Let me look for another approach. Oh right! The optical theorem comes into play here. The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The theorem says that σ_total = 4π |f|^2, but more importantly, it states that Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total. Wait, but maybe I'm not using that correctly here.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2ik)) times the sum over l of (2l + 1) tan δ_l. So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) tan δ_l.

But wait, what is k? The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but since the problem gives the energy as 50 MeV, I need to calculate k. Alternatively, I might have to convert the energy into appropriate units for the formula.

Wait, but the problem asks for the imaginary part in units of fm. So perhaps k is in inverse fm? So I need to compute k first.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l + 1) tan δ_l. Oh, but since the question is about the imaginary part, let's compute that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let me try to find it.

Another approach: I remember that the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) [ e^{iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l^0 (cosθ). For the forward direction, θ=0, so P_l^0(1) = 1. So then f(0) becomes sum_{l} ( (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ). 

So f(0) = sum ( (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) )/(2ik ). The imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary part of this sum.

Breaking it down, each term is (2l+1)/(2ik) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ). Let's compute e^{iδ_l} -1 = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l - 1. That's [ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ]. 

So e^{iδ_l} -1 = 2i sin(δ_l/2) e^{i (δ_l/2) }? Wait, maybe it's easier to compute this as:

e^{iθ} - 1 = e^{iθ/2} ( e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2} ) ) = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2). So e^{iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{i δ_l/2} sin(δ_l/2).

Wait, but perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, the term e^{iδ_l} -1 is a complex number. So, let's compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

Each term in the sum for f(0) is (2l + 1)/(2ik) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1). So, taking the imaginary part of each term:

Im[ (2l + 1)/(2ik) (e^{iδ_l} -1) ] = (2l +1)/(2ik) * Im( e^{iδ_l} -1 ). 

Wait, but e^{iδ_l} -1 = cos δ_l -1 + i sin δ_l. So the imaginary part is sin δ_l. So, Im of each term is (2l +1)/(2ik) * sin δ_l.

Wait, but then the total Im(f(0)) would be sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l +1)/(2ik) * sin δ_l ].

Wait a minute, but that can't be right because the units don't seem to match up. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let me think again. The term (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) is 2i sin(δ_l/2) e^{i δ_l/2}, but perhaps that's not necessary. Alternatively, the imaginary part of (e^{iδ_l} -1) is sin δ_l. So, I think that's correct.

So, the imaginary part of f(0) would be sum_{l} [ (2l+1)/(2ik) * sin δ_l ].

But wait, what is k? Because energy is given as 50 MeV. So I need to calculate k in appropriate units.

Hmm, what's the relation between k and energy? The energy E is related to the kinetic energy of the electron. Since electrons are much lighter than nuclei, perhaps we can use non-relativistic formulas, but I'm not sure. Wait, but 50 MeV is a lot of energy for an electron. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is highly relativistic.

But maybe the problem expects me to use the relativistic relation. So, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the momentum p is given by E = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 ) ) / c^2. Wait, perhaps it's easier to write k in terms of E.

Wait, but in terms of scattering, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but that's the non-relativistic formula. For high energies, relativistic formulas are better. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use the non-relativistic formula, given that it's a nuclear target and it's elastic scattering, but I might have to proceed with the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but I need to get the units right. Let me think about the units.

The energy E is 50 MeV. Let's convert that into Joules, but maybe it's easier in terms of eV, and then to other units. Wait, but perhaps I can use atomic units or use natural units where ħ = c =1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's compute k in units of inverse fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

But perhaps I should recall that the Compton wavelength is related. Or maybe express E in terms of eV, then find p from E, then k = p / ħ.

Wait, okay, let's proceed step by step. The energy of the electron is 50 MeV. Let me compute the momentum p using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.

E = 50 MeV.

m = mass of electron = 0.511 MeV/c².

So,

(50)^2 = (pc)^2 + (0.511)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = 50^2 - 0.511^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739.

So, pc ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.99739 MeV.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV) / c.

But I need p in units that will let me compute k = p/(ħ). Let's see.

Wait, let's compute k in units of inverse fm.

First, let's compute p in eV·s/m (momentum unit) but perhaps it's easier to use natural units where ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm). Wait, yes, I remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c. But since c is in fm per second? Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the calculation.

Alternatively, since ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused with units. Let me approach it another way. Let's compute p in MeV/c.

From earlier, p = 49.99739 MeV/c.

We have ħ in units of MeV·fm. Since ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s, and 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, so 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

But I think it's easier to use the relation ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

Wait, but c is in fm/s. Let me think. 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and speed of light c is ~3e8 m/s. So, c = 3e8 m/s = 3e8 / 1e15 fm/s = 3e-7 fm/s. So c ≈ 3e-7 fm/s.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of ħ in units of MeV·fm.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s = 6.582 ×10^-25 * 1000 MeV * s.

Wait, so 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute k as p/(ħ), where p is in MeV/c and ħ is in MeV·fm. Let's see.

p = 49.99739 MeV/c.

ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Wait, because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

So k = p / ħ = [49.99739 MeV/c ] / [197.33 MeV·fm / c ].

The c cancels, and MeV units cancel. So,

k = 49.99739 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute that: 49.99739 / 197.33 ≈ approximately 0.2534.

So, k ≈ 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Now, going back to the formula for Im(f(0)).

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2i k)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) tanδ_l.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the formula came out to be sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )/( 2 k ), because I thought the imaginary part is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k ). Wait, because from earlier, each term's imaginary part was (2l+1) sin δ_l/(2ik), multiplied by 1/(i k) from the 1/(2i k) factor? No, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, let's correct this. Earlier, I thought of each term as [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ} -1 ) ]/(2ik ), and the imaginary part of that is [ (2l +1) sin δ ]/(2k ), because when you expand (e^{iδ} - 1 ), the imaginary part is sin δ. So, im(f(0)) is sum_{l} [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/( 2k ).

Wait, but wait, because the overall factor is 1/(2ik), so when you take the imaginary part, you have to consider that.

Wait, let me think again. For each term, (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) / (2ik ), the imaginary part is [ (2l+1) * Im( e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ] / (2ik ) * i ?

No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express it.

Each term is (2l+1)/(2ik) * (e^{i δ_l} - 1 )

= (2l+1)/(2ik) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l - 1 ]

= (2l+1)/(2ik) [ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ]

So, the imaginary part of this term is (2l+1)/(2ik) * sin δ_l.

But the imaginary part of the entire sum is the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k) * (1/i) ?

Wait, no, because when you have a term A/(i), the imaginary part would be -(A's real part) because 1/i = -i.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute 1/(2ik) * something.

Wait, 1/(2ik) is (1/2i) * (1/k ). So, when you multiply by a complex number, say, a + ib, it's (a + ib)/(2ik) = [ a/(2ik) ) + ib/(2ik) ) ] = [ a/(2ik) ) + b/(2k) ) ].

Wait, the imaginary part of this expression is b/(2k) because a/(2ik) is real divided by imaginary, which is imaginary. But when you take the imaginary part, the a term contributes nothing (since it's imaginary), and the b term gives b/(2k).

Wait, no, the imaginary part would be the coefficient of i in the expression. Let me write it out.

Suppose I have a term (2l+1)/(2ik) * (e^{i δ_l} -1 ), which is (2l+1)/(2ik) * [ (cos δ_l -1 ) + i sin δ_l ]

= (2l+1)/(2ik) [ (cos δ_l -1 ) + i sin δ_l ]

= (2l+1)/(2ik) (cos δ_l -1 ) + (2l+1)/(2ik) * i sin δ_l.

= [ (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1) ] / (2ik) + [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k )

So, the imaginary part of this term is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k ), because the first term is real (since it's multiplied by 1/(ik), which is imaginary, so the entire term is real? Wait, perhaps no. Let me think: (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 ) is real, and it's divided by (2ik ), which is imaginary. So, the first term becomes a real number multiplied by 1/(ik ), which is imaginary. So, the first term is purely imaginary. The second term is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (i / (2ik )) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the imaginary part of each term.

Each term is (2l+1)/(2ik) * (e^{i δ_l} - 1 )

= (2l+1)/(2ik) [ (cos δ_l -1 ) + i sin δ_l ]

= (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l -1 )/(2ik) + i sin δ_l/(2ik) ]

= (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l -1 )/(2ik) + (i sin δ_l )/(2ik) ]

Simplify the second term: (i sin δ_l )/(2ik) = (sin δ_l )/(2k )

The first term: (cos δ_l -1 )/(2ik ) = [ (cos δ_l -1 ) / (2k ) ] * (1/i )

But 1/i = -i, so that term becomes [ (cos δ_l -1 ) / (2k ) ] * (-i )

So now, the entire term is:

(2l+1) [ (-i (cos δ_l -1 ))/(2k ) + sin δ_l/(2k ) ]

So, the imaginary part is the coefficient of i times (2l+1)/(2k )

The real part is the coefficient not involving i, but since we're only interested in the imaginary part of f(0), which is the sum of all the imaginary parts of the terms, we can focus on the terms with i.

Looking at the first term: (-i (cos δ_l -1 )) * (2l+1)/(2k )

The coefficient of i is -(2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 )/(2k )

So, the imaginary part of each term is [ -(2l+1)(cos δ_l -1 )/(2k ) ].

Wait, but in the second term, we have (sin δ_l ) (2l+1)/(2k ), which is real, so it doesn't contribute to the imaginary part. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier and the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum_{l} (2l+1) tan δ_l (1/(2k)).

Wait, because I've read before that Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1 ) tan δ_l.

Wait, perhaps I should look for that formula.

Yes, I think the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) tan δ_l.

So in this problem, we're only considering l=0 to 4, so the sum is from l=0 to 4.

So, let's compute that.

Given the phase shifts:

δ0 = 90°, which is π/2 radians. So tan δ0 = tan(90°) is infinity. Wait, that's a problem. Because if any phase shift δ_l is 90°, tan δ_l is infinite, which would make Im(f(0)) infinite. But that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't applicable when δ_l is 90°, but that's not realistic; scattering can have any phase shift. Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that when δ_l = 90°, the partial wave amplitude for that l is such that (e^{i δ_l} - 1 ) = e^{i π/2} -1 = i -1, which is a purely imaginary number. So, perhaps that term contributes to the imaginary part.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me get back to the formula. If the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) tan δ_l, and δ0 is 90°, then tan(90°) is infinity. So this would imply that Im(f(0)) is infinite. But that can't be right because the cross-section can't be infinite, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another source I recall says that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l +1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ). So, Im(f(0)) would be the sum of [ (2l+1) Im(e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ] / (2k ).

But Im(e^{i δ_l} -1 ) is sin δ_l, as e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so e^{iθ} -1 = (cosθ-1) + i sinθ. So the imaginary part is sinθ.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Ah, that makes more sense. So, the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] / (2k )

So now, I can compute each term for l=0 to 4.

But wait, in this case, δ0 is 90 degrees, so sin(90) = 1.

So let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0 +1) =1. sin(90°) =1. So term is 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: 2*1+1=3. sin(67°). Let me compute sin(67 degrees). Let's see, sin(60)=0.866, sin(67) is around 0.9205.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. sin(55 degrees). sin(55)= approx 0.8192.

l=3: 2*3+1=7. sin(30 degrees)=0.5.

l=4: 2*4+1=9. sin(13 degrees)= approx 0.22495.

Now, sum these up:

l=0: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 *0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495 ≈2.02455.

Adding them up:

1 + 2.7615 =3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096=7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum is approximately 13.382.

Now, divide by (2k), where k≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So denominator: 2 * 0.2534 ≈0.5068.

So Im(f(0)) ≈13.382 / 0.5068 ≈26.41 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option D) 251.271 fm, which is about 10 times higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation of k. Earlier, I thought k was approximately 0.2534 fm^{-1}, but perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

E =50 MeV.

p c = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, no, the correct formula is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, (p c )^2 = E^2 - (m c^2 )^2.

E in MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So, E =50 MeV.

So,

p c = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.99739 MeV.

So, p c ≈49.99739 MeV.

But I need p in units that work with ħ in MeV fm.

I know that ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, k = p/(ħ ) = (p c ) / (ħ c )

Wait, because p = (p c ) / c.

So,

k = (p c ) / ( ħ c )

= (49.99739 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

Because ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k = (49.99739) / (197.33 ) fm^{-1} ≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Ah, same as before. So, Im(f(0)) = sum/(2k )=13.382/(2*0.2534) ≈13.382/(0.5068) ≈26.41 fm.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 177.675 fm and option D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) tan δ_l.

But then, for l=0, tan(90) is infinity, so that would make the entire sum infinite, which can't be right.

Hmm, but perhaps in reality, when δ_l = 90 degrees, the partial wave doesn't contribute because the amplitude would be purely imaginary, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should ignore the l=0 term? That would be odd because it's part of the phase shifts given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the situation where δ_l = 90 degrees as a special case where the partial wave amplitude is purely imaginary.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin δ_l.

So, in this problem, the sum is approximately 13.382, and k is 0.2534 fm^-1.

So, 13.382/(2*0.2534) ≈13.382/0.5068 ≈26.41 fm.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the phase shift values given.

Wait, the problem says:

δo=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

So, l=0: 90°, yes.

l=1: 67°, correct.

l=2:55°, yes.

l=3:30°, correct.

l=4:13°, correct.

So the values I used are correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in a different way. Let's try using the non-relativistic formula.

In non-relativistic physics, k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But with E in the rest frame of the target, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the energy given is 50 MeV, which is way beyond the non-relativistic domain, but perhaps the problem expects me to proceed.

The mass of the electron is m = 0.511 MeV/c².

So, k = sqrt(2 * m * E ) / ħ.

But let's compute this using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1.

So, E =50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50 ) MeV^{1/2}.

= sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV^{1/2}.

But to convert to inverse fm, I need to relate MeV^{1/2} to fm^{-1}.

I know that 1 GeV^{-1} ≈ 1.97e-15 fm = 1.97 fm ×1e-15. Wait, no, 1 GeV^{-1} is approximately 1.97e-16 meters, which is 1.97e-16 / 1e-15 = 0.197 fm. Wait, 1 eV^{-1} is about 1.97e-17 m, which is 1.97e-2 fm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the conversion factor: 1 (MeV)^{-1/2} = (1e6 eV)^{-1/2}.

But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1 fm^{-1} = 197.33 MeV / (ħ c).

So, k (fm^{-1}) = [ sqrt(2 m E) ] / ħ.

But in the non-relativistic formula, E is in the rest frame of the target. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I computed k earlier. Let me try again.

In the relativistic case, we have E^2 = (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2.

So, p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) ≈ E for large E.

So, p = E/(c^2 ) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2 )^2 / E^2 ) ≈ E/(c^2 ) * [1 - (m^2 c^4 )/(2 E^2 ) ]

For E =50 MeV and m c^2 =0.511 MeV, the term (m c^2 )^2 / E^2 is negligible, so p c ≈ E.

So, p c ≈50 MeV.

Then, using ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm, p = (50 MeV ) / (c ) 

Wait, but then k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = (50)/(197.33) fm^{-1} ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is the same as before, so Im(f(0)) = sum/(2k )=13.382/(2 *0.253) ≈13.382/0.506 ≈26.41 fm.

But the options given don't include this value. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) tan δ_l.

But then, with l=0, tan(90) is infinity. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of this differently. Maybe the problem is using the Coulomb scattering formula, but that's for charged particles, and electrons do have charge. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the Molière scattering, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum_{l} (2l+1) ( (1 - cos δ_l ) / (2k ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should see what the options are. The options are in the hundreds of fm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum with more precise sine values.

Compute each term:

l=0: (2l+1) =1. δ=90°, sin=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67°). Let me compute sin(67°) more accurately.

Using a calculator, sin(67°) ≈0.92050485.

3 *0.92050485=2.76151455.

l=2:5 * sin(55°). sin(55°)= approx 0.819152044 →5 *0.819152=4.09576022.

l=3:7 * sin(30°)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°)=9 *0.224951054 → approx 2.024559486.

Now, summing these:

1 +2.76151455 =3.76151455.

+4.09576022 =7.85727477.

+3.5=11.35727477.

+2.024559486=13.38183426.

So sum is approximately13.381834.

Now, 2k: 2 *0.2534 ≈0.5068.

So Im(f(0))=13.381834 /0.5068 ≈26.41 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) [ (1 - cos δ_l ) ] / (2k ).

Wait, then for each term:

l=0: 1*(1-0)=1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos67°). cos67≈0.3907311 →1-0.3907311=0.6092689. 3 *0.6092689≈1.8278067.

l=2:5*(1 - cos55°). cos55≈0.5736 →1-0.5736=0.4264. 5*0.4264=2.132.

l=3:7*(1 - cos30°)=7*(1 - (√3/2)) → cos30≈0.8660 →1 -0.8660=0.13397. 7 *0.13397≈0.9378.

l=4:9*(1 - cos13°). cos13≈0.974370 →1-0.97437=0.02563. 9 *0.02563≈0.23067.

Summing these:

1 +1.8278067=2.8278067.

+2.132=4.9598067.

+0.9378=5.8976.

+0.23067=6.12827.

So sum is ≈6.12827.

Then, Im(f(0))=6.12827/(2k )=6.12827/(2 *0.2534)=6.12827/0.5068≈12.09 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think about the formula for the cross-section. The total cross-section σ_total is given by the sum over l of ( (2l+1) (4π/ k² ) ) * |f_l|². But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the amplitude is related to the cross-section. From the optical theorem, Im(f(0)) = k/(4π) * σ_total.

But I don't have σ_total given here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/(2i k)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ). So, the imaginary part is [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k ), as I thought before.

But then, with the sum being 13.3818, and k=0.2534, I get 26.41, which is not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 355.351 fm, which is much larger than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.

E=50 MeV.

In natural units where ħ=c=1, E is 50 MeV.

k= sqrt(2 m E )/(2 m E )? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, in natural units, k= sqrt(2 m E ) because the energy is E=ħ² k²/(2m) → k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, but with ħ in MeV fm units.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me compute k in natural units.

In natural units (ħ=1, c=1), E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

So, k = sqrt(2 m E ) = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 ) ≈ sqrt(51.1 ) ≈7.15 MeV^{1/2}.

But how to convert MeV^{1/2} to inverse fm.

Wait, 1 fm^{-1} is 1e15 m^{-1}.

But I'm not sure about the conversion factor from MeV^{1/2} to fm^{-1}.

Alternatively, using the relation ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1 MeV^{-1} = (197.33 fm )^{-1}.

Wait, but MeV^{-1} is inverse energy, which corresponds to length via ħ c = E * l.

Hmm, perhaps I can write k in terms of MeV^{1/2} as follows.

Since k is in natural units (MeV^{1/2}), and 1 fm^{-1} is 1e15 m^{-1}.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express k in units of inverse fm using the conversion factor involving ħ c.

k = p/ħ.

p in MeV/c → since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm, p c =49.99739 MeV.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV ) / c.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (49.99739 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) )

The c cancels, MeV cancels,

k = 49.99739 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Which brings me back to the same value as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for k.

Wait, but I think I've tried that already.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k ), which gives 26.41 fm, but none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 13 times larger than my calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recalculate each term precisely.

l=0: 2l+1=1, δ=90 → sin=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°)=3 *0.92050485345= 2.76151456.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Sum:

1 +2.76151456=3.76151456.

+4.0957602214=7.8572747814.

+3.5=11.3572747814.

+2.0245594887=13.3818342701.

So sum is 13.3818342701.

Divide by (2k)= 2 *0.2534=0.5068.

13.3818342701 /0.5068≈26.412 fm.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, the options are A)87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

So, 26.412 is not there. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l } -1 ), and the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k).

But then, when δ_l=90°, sin δ_l=1, so l=0 contributes 1.

But perhaps I should include the factors correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts given are for higher l, but no, the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ), and the imaginary part is the sum of [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k) + [ (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ) ]/(2k ) * i.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ), and the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k ) + [ sum (2l+1) (cos δ_l -1 ) ]/(2k ) * (-i).

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) tan δ_l. But then, for l=0, tan(90°) is infinity, which is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) [ (e^{i δ_l} -1) ].

But again, for l=0, e^{i π/2} -1 = i -1 → Im part is 1, so (2l+1) sin δ_l=1.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) tan δ_l.

But with l=0, tan(90°)=infinite, so that's impossible.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the l=0 term because tan(90) is infinite, but that doesn't seem correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what happens when δ_l=90°. In that case, the partial wave amplitude is purely imaginary. So, perhaps the term contributes (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )= (2l+1)/(2k ), since sin(90)=1.

Wait, so for l=0, it's 1/(2k ).

So, the sum is 1/(2k ) + 3 sin(67)/(2k ) +5 sin(55)/(2k ) +7 sin(30)/(2k ) +9 sin(13)/(2k ).

Which is same as (1 +3 sin67 +5 sin55 +7 sin30 +9 sin13 )/(2k )

Which is same as (sum from l=0 to4 (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k )

Which is what I calculated earlier as 26.41 fm.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ), and the real part is ignored, but the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k ).

So, I think I did that correctly.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in a different unit, but the options are in fm. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

k = p / ħ.

p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈49.99739 MeV.

So, p=49.99739 MeV /c.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV/c ), and ħ= (197.33 MeV fm )/(c )

So, k= p/(ħ ) = (49.99739 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) )=49.99739/(197.33) fm^{-1}≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Yes, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians? But no, the question says degrees.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part of the amplitude is given by Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] / (k ).

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the denominator. Let me try that.

So, Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k )

Which would be 13.381834 / 0.2534 ≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) tan δ_l.

But then, for l=0, tan(90)=infinite. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ), and the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k )

Which is what I've been doing.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k. Let me think: k= sqrt(8 m E )/ħ ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for the wave number.

Wait, relativistic energy: E = sqrt( (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But when I compute that, I get the same value as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) ( (1 - cos δ_l ) )/(2k )

Which would give a smaller value, but that's not matching either.

I'm stuck. The only option close to the calculation I'm getting is none of the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum again.

Wait, the sum is 13.381834.

k=0.2534 fm^{-1}.

13.381834 / (2 *0.2534 )=13.381834 /0.5068≈26.41 fm.

But the options are all much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute it numerically again.

k = p/(ħ )

p = E/(c^2 ) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2 )^2 / E^2 )

E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So, (m c^2 )^2 /E^2 = (0.511)^2 / (50)^2 ≈0.261 /2500 ≈0.0001044.

So, sqrt(1 - 0.0001044 )≈0.999948.

So, p c = E * sqrt(1 - (m c^2 )^2 / E^2 ) ≈50 * 0.999948≈49.9974 MeV.

So, p c ≈49.9974 MeV.

k = p/(ħ )

But p = (49.9974 MeV )/(c )

So, ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

So, k = [49.9974 MeV / c ] / [197.33 MeV fm / c ] = 49.9974 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Same as before. So, no mistake there.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where I went wrong. The calculation seems correct, but the answer doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps I should look for any other factors I might have missed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of π radians. For example, δ0=90° is π/2, but perhaps I should have converted to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, no, because sin(90°)=1, whether in degrees or radians.

Wait, but perhaps I should have converted degrees to radians when calculating the sine.

Wait, but sin(67 degrees) is the same whether I compute it in degrees or radians? No, wait, no, the calculator must be in degrees mode.

Wait, if I compute sin(67°), it's approximately 0.9205, which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) ( (1 - cos δ_l ) ) / (k )

So, sum of (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l ) divided by k.

Compute that:

l=0:1*(1- cos90 )=1*(1-0)=1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos67 )=3*(1-0.390731)=3*(0.609269)=1.827807.

l=2:5*(1 - cos55 )=5*(1-0.57359)=5*(0.42641)=2.13205.

l=3:7*(1 - cos30 )=7*(1 -0.866025)=7*(0.133975)=0.937825.

l=4:9*(1 - cos13 )=9*(1-0.97437)=9*(0.02563)=0.23067.

Sum=1 +1.827807=2.827807.

+2.13205=4.959857.

+0.937825=5.897682.

+0.23067=6.128352.

So sum≈6.128352.

Im(f(0))=6.128352 /k =6.128352 /0.2534 ≈24.20 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, 251.271 fm is approximately 100 times larger than my calculated 26.41 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere in the units. Let me check the units of k.

Wait, perhaps I confused fm with 10^-15 m. But no, I used the correct unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula for k. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the calculation should be done in natural units where ħ=1, c=1, then convert to fm at the end.

So, E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

k = sqrt(2 m E ) = sqrt( 2 *0.511 *50 )=sqrt(51.1 ) ≈7.15 MeV^{1/2}.

Now, 1 MeV^{1/2} is equal to (197.33 MeV fm )^{1/2} = sqrt(197.33 ) MeV^{1/2} fm^{1/2}.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should relate MeV^{1/2} to fm^{-1}.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 1 MeV^{-1} is equal to (197.33 fm )^{-1}.

But I'm not making progress here.

Perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is approximately 251.271 fm, and perhaps it's 10 times my calculation.

Wait, 26.41 *10 =264.1, which is close to option D)251.271.

But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the formula includes a factor of 2, making the sum 26.41 *2=52.82 fm, which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sinδ_l )/(k ), which would be 13.381834 / 0.2534 ≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I did, which gives approximately 26.41 fm, but that's not among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k, leading to the wrong value.

Wait, another thought: perhaps k should be in units of 1/fm, but in reality, it's in 1/angstrom or another unit. Let me check: 1 fm =0.1 angstrom.

Wait, no, 1 angstrom is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m, and 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 angstrom is 1000 fm.

But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in units of 1/angstrom and see.

Wait, 1 angstrom = 100 fm.

So, 0.2534 fm^{-1} = 0.2534 *100 angstrom^{-1} =25.34 angstrom^{-1}.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k and it should be 0.2534 inverse fm, but in the formula, I used 2k, which would be 0.5068. But perhaps I should have used k as 0.2534, leading to 13.3818 /0.2534≈52.83 fm.

Still not matching any options.

At this point, I'm not sure where the mistake is. I'll have to make an educated guess, but based on the given options, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is about 13 times my calculation.

Wait, but 13.381834 * 1000 would be 13381.834, but that's way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each phase shift is multiplied by (l+1/2), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k ), leading to 52.83 fm.

Still not matching.

Perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, but I'm not sure how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, so I should convert them to radians before calculating the sine.

Let me try that.

δ0=90°=π/2 radians. sin(π/2)=1.

δ1=67°=67 *π/180 ≈1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937)=0.9205.

δ2=55°=0.95993 radians. sin≈0.8192.

δ3=30°=0.523599 radians. sin=0.5.

δ4=13°=0.226893 radians. sin≈0.22495.

So, the sum terms remain the same. So that's not the issue.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'm going to have to conclude that the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, but I'm not sure how to reach it.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \) are provided, and the rest are ignored. The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived as:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation \( k = \frac{p}{\hbar} \), where \( p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2c^4}}{c} \). Substituting \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the momentum \( p \) is found to be approximately \( 49.997 \, \text{MeV}/c \). Using \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm} \), \( k \) is computed as:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{49.997}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.2534 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Next, the sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(\delta_l) \) is calculated for the given phase shifts:

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2l + 1) \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \),
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2l + 1) \sin(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 2.7615 \),
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2l + 1) \sin(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 4.096 \),
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2l + 1) \sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5 \),
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2l + 1) \sin(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 2.0246 \).

Summing these contributions gives:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.0246 = 13.3821.
\]

Substituting into the formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \):

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{13.3821}{2k} = \frac{13.3821}{2 \cdot 0.2534} \approx 26.41 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. After rechecking the calculations and considering potential errors in the formula or units, the closest plausible answer is **option D) 251.271 fm**, which is approximately 10 times the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor or error in the interpretation of the formula.

Answer: D
