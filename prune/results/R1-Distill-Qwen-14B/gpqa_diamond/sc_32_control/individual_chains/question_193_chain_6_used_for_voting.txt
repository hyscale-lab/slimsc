Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, with different exponents of r.

Hmm. I think I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in parsecs is inversely proportional to distance (d). So plx = 1/d. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh wait, distance d is 1/plx. Because if something is closer, the parallax is larger, right? Like nearby stars have larger parallaxes. So yeah, d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to d.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars varying with parallax. So the number N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/(1/d)^5. Because if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, wait, let's make sure. Oh, no, wait. If plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is how N changes with distance, per unit distance. Hmm.

But wait, the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Wait, per unit of r. So perhaps it's asking about the number of stars as a function of r, and the rate of change of N with r.

Wait, or maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr. Oh, that's a common approach in these kinds of problems. So the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr would be the volume element times the density, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the differential number of stars per distance interval. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a range dr would be d^5 multiplied by dr, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases as d^5 as you go further out. But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, the options are about the change per unit distance. So, perhaps it's the derivative dN/dr.

Wait, let's think again. If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be 5d^4. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the way the question is phrased, it's about the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm, perhaps it's asking for N as a function of r. So N ∝ r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check.

So parallax plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So number of stars N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. So in terms of r (distance), N ∝ r^5.

So the correct answer should be option B, which is ~ r^5.

But wait, the question is about per unit range of distance. So maybe it's about the density of stars. Let's think again. Suppose you have a volume element that's a shell of radius r and thickness dr. The volume is 4πr² dr. If the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d^5 times the volume, which is 4πr² dr, then the number would be proportional to r^5 * r^2 dr = r^7 dr. But that's not matching the options. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original setup. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So for a given distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So as you move to a larger d, more stars. So if you consider the change in N as you move from d to d+dr, the number of stars increases by 5d^4 dr, roughly. But the question is per unit distance, so perhaps it's the derivative, which is 5d^4. But that's not an option, and the options are about how N scales with r, not the rate of change.

Wait, but the options are about how N changes with r. So for a given r, N is proportional to r^5. So the option is B. But why is the question phrased as "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"?

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit volume. Because N ∝ 1/plx^5 = d^5. So the number density would be N / volume. So if N is proportional to d^5, and the volume is proportional to d^3, then number density is proportional to d^2. But that's not the question. The question is about the number of stars in a region, not about number density.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm trying to make it more complicated than it is. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, so N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with distance as d^5. So when they ask how the number changes with distance, the answer is proportional to r^5, which is option B.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5 \). Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( d^5 \), or equivalently \( r^5 \), where \( r \) represents distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This implies that the number of stars scales as a function of \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the correct answer is that the number of stars increases proportionally to \( r^5 \).
