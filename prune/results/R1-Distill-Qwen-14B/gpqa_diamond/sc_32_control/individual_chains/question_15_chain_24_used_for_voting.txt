Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, so the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they only have limited observing time. Both are detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known.

Wait, both have the same mass. So their masses are equal. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

They have circular orbits, so that's good—no eccentricity to complicate things. The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but their radii are same. Interesting.

The question is about transit probability. So, what affects the probability of a planet transiting its star?

I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the relative size of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a * sin i)), but wait, I think the main factors are the alignment of the orbit (edge-on) and the size ratio.

Wait, no. The probability of a transit is given by the formula:

Probability ≈ (R_planet + R_star) / a

Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit. More accurately, the probability is (R_star / a) * (1 +/- ...) but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (something else). Wait, I think the formula is more like (R_star / a) multiplied by (1/(1 - (R_planet/a)^2)^(1/2)) ). That sounds complicated.

Alternatively, I've heard before that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2))) ), but maybe I should think differently.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall that the transit probability P is given by:

P ≈ (R_p + R_s) / (a * sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2)) )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

I think the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_* / a) * [ (1 + (R_p / R_*) ) / sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2) ]

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) divided by (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2)) ). Or perhaps it's (R_*/a) multiplied by (1 + R_p/R_*).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability is the area of the star (π R_**²) divided by the area of the planet's orbital disk (π a²). Wait, no, that would be the geometric probability. But that's not exactly right because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the path it takes in front of the star depends on the inclination.

Wait, geometric probability is (R_* + R_p) / a * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_p/R_*)^2)) )) Wait, or maybe that's the probability of a transit occurring for a given inclination.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula as:

P = (R_* / a) * [ (1 + (R_p/R_* )) / sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Let me try to think about the factors that influence the probability.

The transit probability increases with larger planet size (R_p), larger star radius (R_*), and smaller semi-major axis (a). Because a smaller orbit means the planet is more likely to pass in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, but wait: the probability is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller because the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is higher when it's closer. So higher a means lower probability.

Wait, but in this case, the planets have different orbital periods, so their semi-major axes (a) are different.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_*)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (P² * M_*)^(1/3).

Given that, Planet_1 has a period P1 = P_2 / 3. And M1 = 2 M_2.

So, a1^3 / P1^2 = G(2 M_2) / (4π²)
a2^3 / P2^2 = G( M_2 ) / (4π²)

Dividing the two equations:

(a1^3 / a2^3) = (P1^2 / P2^2) * (2 M_2 / M_2)
P1 = P2/3, so P1^2 = P2^2 /9.

Then,

(a1/a2)^3 = ( (P2^2 /9) ) / (P2^2) ) * 2
= (1/9) * 2
= 2/9.

So (a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

Wait, cube root of 2/9 is cube root of approximately 0.222. Let me compute it: 0.222 is about 2.22e-1. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Since a is the semi-major axis, Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Now, transit probability P is proportional to (R_* /a) * (something else). Let's think about the key factors.

The main factors affecting the transit probability are:

1. (R_p / R_*) — larger means higher probability, but also depends on other factors.

2. The relative size of the orbit, a. Smaller a leads to higher probability.

But let's get back to the exact formula. The geometric transit probability is given by:

P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_* )) / sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Another source I remember says the transit probability is approximately:

P = (R_* + R_p) / (a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) )

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, sometimes it's approximated as (R_* / a) multiplied by a factor, but I think the main factors are (R_* / a) and (R_p)² or something.

Wait, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p/R_*)^2, but that's when the orbital plane is edge-on. Wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The probability is more about the alignment.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approximate transit probability as being proportional to (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2))).

Because if the planet is small compared to the star, R_p << R_*, so R_p can be neglected, then P ≈ R_*/(a * sqrt(1 - (R_p^2/a²)) ) ≈ R_* /a * (1 + (R_p^2/(2 a²)) ) ). So approximately, P ∝ R_* /a.

Wait, but in that case, the probability is directly proportional to R_* and inversely proportional to a.

Wait, but let's think about that. If a is smaller, the planet is closer, so the transit is more likely. So P is higher when a is smaller.

Given that, for Planet_1, a1 is smaller than a2. So Planet_1's a is smaller, making P higher.

But both stars have the same radius, R_*1 = R_*2 = R.

So, for the transit probability, P1 ∝ R/(a1), and P2 ∝ R/(a2).

Given that a1 = 0.6 a2 (approximated), then P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/(0.6 a2 ) = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666...

So P1 is about 1.666 times P2. So the probability of transit for Planet_1 is higher.

Wait, but the options say which is preferred. The researchers would prefer the one with higher probability.

So if P1 is higher, then they should observe Planet_1. But let's make sure.

Wait, but what about the planet radius? Oh, right, both are Earth-like, so R_p1 ≈ R_p2.

Wait, but wait, the host stars have the same radius, so R_*1 = R_*2.

So yes, in the approximation, P1 is 1.666 times higher than P2.

Wait, but looking at the options: option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times.

Hmm, so according to the approximation, the ratio is about 1.666, which is approximately 1.65, so option C.

But wait, I'm making an approximation. Let me compute more accurately.

Earlier, I had (a1/a2)^3 = (2/9) ≈ 0.2222.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 = 0.222222...

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Thus, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.648 a1.

So, P = R/(a) . So P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/(a2).

So P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1.648.

So P1 is about 1.648 times P2. So approximately 1.65 times higher.

Thus, Planet_1 has a higher probability, so the researchers should choose Planet_1, and the probability is about 1.65 times higher.

Looking at the options, option C says: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which depends on the star's radius \( R_* \), the planet's orbital semi-major axis \( a \), and the planet's radius \( R_p \). The transit probability is approximately proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2}}
\]

For Earth-like planets with the same radius (\( R_p \)) and stars with the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends primarily on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) increases the transit probability because the planet is closer to the star, making it more likely to pass in front of the star from our perspective.

### Orbital Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the star's mass \( M_* \) by:

\[
\frac{a^3}{P^2} = \frac{G M_*}{4\pi^2}
\]

For Planet_1, the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), and the star's mass is \( M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2} \). Dividing the equations for \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{P_1^2 M_{*,2}}{P_2^2 M_{*,1}} = \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 M_{*,2}}{P_2^2 \cdot 2 M_{*,2}} = \frac{1}{9 \cdot 2} = \frac{1}{18}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{1}{18}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Since the researchers aim to observe the planet with the higher transit probability, they should prioritize Planet_1.

### Conclusion
The researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.
