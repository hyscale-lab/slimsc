Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries all the operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are A to D, each combining some of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they preserve. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM, right?

Wait, what about the symmetries themselves. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is broader, encompassing both Lorentz symmetry and translations. So Poincare includes Lorentz. Oh wait, but in the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect both or just one?

I think in the context of SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that respects the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry and, by extension, Poincare because it includes translations. Wait, but maybe the SMEFT operators are constructed to respect the same gauge and global symmetries as the SM, which would include Lorentz symmetry.

So for Lorentz symmetry, I think that all operators must be Lorentz invariant. Because if an operator isn't, it would break Lorentz symmetry, which isn't allowed in a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

Now, Poincare symmetry (2) includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But I'm not entirely sure if SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, I remember that in SMEFT, the operators are considered in a Poincare-invariant theory. Because the SM is Poincare-invariant, so the effective theory should maintain that. So all operators must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, which together make Poincare.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry is more of a spacetime symmetry, and SMEFT is built as an effective theory that includes all possible terms respecting the same gauge symmetries as the SM, which includes Lorentz. So maybe the operators are required to respect Lorentz and Poincare. Or is Poincare automatically respected if Lorentz is?

Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering Poincare symmetry as a separate condition. Let me think: does the SMEFT Lagrangian maintain Poincare symmetry? I think it does, because all terms are constructed to be Lorentz scalar, which implies Poincare invariance since the Lagrangian is a scalar (so translation invariant too). So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but some sources say that SMEFT is built under the assumption of preserving the Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare (1 and 2) must be respected.

Next, CP symmetry (3): I'm not sure. The SM has some CP symmetry but not all its terms do. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So do the SMEFT operators have to respect CP symmetry? No, because the SM itself doesn't. So operators in SMEFT can have CP violation terms. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) doesn't have to be respected by all operators.

CPT symmetry (4): CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM is CPT symmetric. I think any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. So if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry (which they must), then they must also respect CPT.

Wait, but wait: CPT symmetry is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry and quantum mechanics. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant. So if all SMEFT operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they must respect CPT as a result. So (4) is a must.

Putting it all together. The symmetries that must be respected by all operators are:

- Lorentz (1): yes
- Poincare (2): yes (because they are part of the same framework)
Wait, wait no: Lorentz and Poincare are separate. Or wait, no, Poincare includes Lorentz. So if the operators are required to respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Because the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar and translation-invariant.

Wait, the Poincare group includes translations and Lorentz transformations. So for a Lagrangian to be Poincare invariant, it must be a scalar under Lorentz and translation invariant. So yes, if the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, and the Lagrangian is translation-invariant (as it must be for any physical theory), then the operators would respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if all operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, then each operator must be a Poincare scalar. But wait, each operator is a Lorentz scalar but could have terms that transform in certain ways under translation? Or is translation symmetry automatically satisfied if the Lagrangian is a scalar?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the SMEFT operators are constrained to be part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is a part of Poincare. So the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare. Or is Poincare symmetry a given because the operators are constructed in a way that the overall theory is Poincare-invariant, but individual operators don't have to respect Poincare? No, because each operator is a term in the Lagrangian which must be a scalar, so they must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2 (Lorentz and Poincare)
C) 1,2,4 (Lorentz, Poincare, CPT)
D) 1,3,4 (Lorentz, CP, CPT)

Wait, but the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if operators must be Lorentz scalars, which would imply they respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, but each operator in the Lagrangian is a scalar, and the Lagrangian itself is translation invariant, so each term must be translation invariant as well. So each operator must be a scalar (Lorentz) and translation invariant (so Poincare). So yes, both 1 and 2 must be respected.

But wait, is that the case? Because Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation. So if the operator is a scalar under Lorentz and doesn't change under spacetime translations (which is already taken care of by the fact that the Lagrangian is a density, so when you integrate to get the action, it's invariant), then each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and a Poincare scalar.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT operators only need to respect Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily Poincare? Or perhaps it's just Lorentz. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The SMEFT is an effective theory constructed to respect the symmetries of the SM, which includes Lorentz symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincare symmetry (as it's a Lorentz-invariant theory and the Lagrangian is a scalar), then all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well.

So then, operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. However, option A is 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait, I thought that CPT symmetry is a consequence of Lorentz. So if the operators are Lorentz-invariant, then they are automatically CPT-invariant. So all operators must respect CPT as well.

So then the symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4.

But let me think again. Are all operators in SMEFT required to respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, the SMEFT is built under the assumption that all operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies that each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But Poincare includes translations, so the theory's Lagrangian must be a scalar (so that the action is invariant under translations). Therefore, each operator must be a scalar under both Lorentz and translation, meaning that they must be Poincare-invariant.

So the operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2). But wait, isn't Poincare a larger symmetry than Lorentz? So if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But in the question, the options are presented as which must be respected. So if Poincare is a symmetry that must be respected by operators in SMEFT, then 2 is correct.

Wait, but I think that the SMEFT operators are constructed such that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected.

But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2, and 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that CPT must be respected because Lorentz implies CPT. So if the operators are Lorentz-invariant, they must respect CPT. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. That would be option C.

Wait, but what about Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if operators are required to respect Poincare, they must also be invariant under translations. But each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar, so the operator is a scalar under Poincare.

So I think all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But looking back, the first option is 1 and 2 (A) or 1,2,4 (C).

So, the correct answer would be C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but another angle. The Standard Model's effective theory must respect the same gauge and global symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, so SMEFT operators must be as well. But what about Poincare? Well, the SM is Poincare-invariant, so the SMEFT must be too.

So yes, operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4).

So the answer would be C.

Wait, but in the options, C is option C: 1,2,4. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but another thought: Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetry. But in the SMEFT, operators are part of the Lagrangian, which must be a scalar. So each operator must be a scalar under both Lorentz and translation. So yes, they must respect Poincare.

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is constructed as an effective theory that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM), which includes Lorentz symmetry. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because the SM, and thus SMEFT, is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since the SMEFT Lagrangian is a scalar and the action is translation-invariant, operators must respect Poincaré symmetry as part of the framework.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):** The SM does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to CP violation in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Any Lorentz-invariant theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry as a consequence of Lorentz symmetry and quantum mechanics.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
