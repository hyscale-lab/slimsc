Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no. Wait, the rigid rotor model is when the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it's more like the vibration is considered along with rotation. Right, so this model probably includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

But the question is about the fundamental state. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state, where the molecule is at its lowest vibrational energy. So maybe the fundamental state here refers to the ground state of the system.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, but when you're in the fundamental state, it's the ground state of the vibration. So if it's the ground state, the next state would be the first excited state, which is the first vibrational level above the ground.

But wait, could it also involve a change in rotation? Because the rotation-vibration model includes both. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe this refers to the next possible energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, the question is about the photon's momentum needed for the transition. Photons carry energy and momentum. The energy of a photon is E = hf = hc/lambda, and momentum p = E/c = h f /c. But I'm not sure how that ties in yet.

Wait, but in the context of molecular transitions, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from one energy state to another. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states.

So the problem is asking: what's the momentum of the photon that causes the molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Hmm.

But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the system. So the next state must be the first excited state, which is higher in energy.

Wait, but in a diatomic molecule modeled with rotation-vibration coupling, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The total energy is the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. So the ground state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid rotor; I think rigid rotor has J as a quantum number starting from 0).

Wait, but the 'fundamental' state is the lowest vibrational state. So if the molecule is in the vibration ground state (v=0), but maybe the rotational state is higher. Wait, no, because the fundamental state is the lowest overall. So perhaps the next possible state is the next vibrational state (v=1), but that would require a change in the vibrational quantum number.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is the next rotational state (J=1 or J=2) but that would require a change in rotational energy. But since the energy levels are quantized, the photon's energy needs to match the difference between the two states.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is the first higher state regardless of type, whether it's a higher vibrational or rotational state.

But I think the energy levels for rotation and vibration are different. Vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than rotational ones. So the first transition from the ground state would require the least energy. Let me think: the vibrational ground state is v=0, and the next is v=1. The rotational ground state is J=0 or J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid rotor.

Wait, for a rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ² / 2I) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. And the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the moment of inertia can change with vibration. But perhaps for this problem, since we're given the angular frequency w, we can model it as a harmonic oscillator. So the vibrational energy levels are spaced by h w.

Wait, but the problem is about a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0? Or maybe J=1?

Wait, for a diatomic, the rigid rotor model has J starting at 0. So the ground rotational state is J=0. So the total energy of the ground state (v=0, J=0) would be E_0 = (1/2) h w + 0 (since E_J for J=0 is zero).

Wait, no. Wait, the vibrational energy is E_v = (1/2) h w (for v=0) plus h w v. And the rotational energy is E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2 I), with I being the moment of inertia.

So the total energy is E = E_v + E_J.

So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). But which one has lower energy?

Let me compute the energy of those.

First, compute the rotational constant B. The moment of inertia I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert this to kg. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate that.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So Mx + My = 22 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / 22 amu = 40/22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

μ in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (approx 1.818 * 1.66e-27) Let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.66 = approx 3.011. So μ ≈ 3.011e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.011e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.011e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2044e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2 I). ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π). But in terms of value, ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2044e-46) 

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (approx).

Denominator: 2 * 1.2044e-46 = 2.4088e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4088e-46 ≈ approx 4.616e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait. Because 1e-34 squared is 1e-68, yes. Denominator is 2.4e-46. So 1e-68 /1e-46 is 1e-22. So 1.1e-68 / 2.4e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23, which is about 4.6e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 1.05e-34 squared is about (1.05)^2=1.1025, times 1e-68, so 1.1025e-68.

Denominator is 2 * 1.2044e-46 = 2.4088e-46.

So 1.1025e-68 / 2.4088e-46 = (1.1025 / 2.4088) * 1e-22.

1.1025 / 2.4088 is approx 0.457.

So B ≈ 0.457e-22 J, which is 4.57e-23 J.

Wait, that's B. Now, the energy levels for rotation are E_J = B J (J+1).

At J=0: E_0 = 0.

At J=1: E_1= B * 1*2 = 2B = 2 * 4.57e-23 J = 9.14e-23 J.

Vibrational energy at v=0 is (1/2) h w. Wait, the problem gives w as 4e14 rad/s. So h*w is Planck's constant times angular frequency.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

So h*w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (1/2) h w + v h w.

So for v=0: E_v0 = (1/2)(2.65e-19) = 1.325e-19 J.

For v=1: E_v1 = (1/2)(2.65e-19) + 1 * 2.65e-19 = (0.5 + 1) * 2.65e-19 = 3.975e-19 J.

So the energy for (v=0, J=0) is E_0 = E_v0 + E_J0 = 1.325e-19 J + 0 = 1.325e-19 J.

The next possible state is either (v=1, J=0) with E=3.975e-19 J or (v=0, J=1) with E=1.325e-19 + 9.14e-23 = approx 1.325e-19 + 0.000914e-19 = 1.3259e-19 J, which is much lower than 3.975e-19 J.

So the next state is (v=0, J=1), because its energy is lower than the (v=1, J=0) state.

Wait, no, because when you go from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), the energy difference is 9.14e-23 J.

Whereas going from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), the energy difference is (3.975e-19 - 1.325e-19) = 2.65e-19 J.

So 2.65e-19 J is a bigger jump than 9e-23 J.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which is the next higher state? The (v=0, J=1) is the next state, because its energy is just 1.3259e-19, which is much lower than 3.975e-19.

So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between E_0 and E_(J=1, v=0).

So the energy difference ΔE = E(J=1, v=0) - E(J=0, v=0) = 9.14e-23 J.

Wait, but the energy of the photon is E_photon = ΔE. So E_photon = 9.14e-23 J.

The momentum of the photon is p = E_photon / c, because p = E/c for photons.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.14e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.14e-23) / (3e8) = 3.047e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Hmm, my calculation gives 3e-31, which is way smaller than all the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy levels.

Wait, the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's looking at the first possible excited state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

But wait, when in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the first excited states are (v=1, J=0) and (v=0, J=1). But the (v=0, J=1) has a lower energy than (v=1, J=0), so that's the next state.

But my calculation of the energy of (v=0, J=1) is about 9.14e-23 J, which is way lower than the options given. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I've confused something about the rotational energy. Let me double-check the rotational energy calculation.

I think I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recalculate B.

B = ħ²/(2 I)

I = μ r²

μ is the reduced mass. So let's compute that properly.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Converting to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.011e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.011e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I=3.011e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2044e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2 I) = (1.0545718e-34 J s)^2 / (2 * 1.2044e-46 kg m²)

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J² s²).

Denominator: 2 * 1.2044e-46 =2.4088e-46 (kg m²).

So B= (1.112e-68) / (2.4088e-46) = approx 4.616e-23 J.

Wait, that seems correct. So E_J=1 is 2B = 9.232e-23 J.

So the energy difference is 9.232e-23 J.

The photon's energy is this amount. Its momentum is E/c.

E_photon = 9.232e-23 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p_photon = 9.232e-23 / 3e8 = 3.077e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's about 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 to 2e-27 kg m/s. So 1e-27 is about 3e-31 is 0.0003 times 1e-27. So way lower.

Hmm, so either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the model being used is the non-rigid rotor, which means that the bond length isn't fixed. So in that case, the moment of inertia isn't constant, and the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. But I'm not sure how that would affect the energy difference for the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both a rotational and vibrational change. But I thought the question was about the next state, which would be either a pure rotational or pure vibrational change.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition where the photon's energy corresponds to the fundamental vibration, which is the difference between v=0 and v=1. Let me compute that.

The vibrational energy difference (from v=0 to v=1) is h*w.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_v = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

So the photon's energy would be 2.65e-19 J.

The momentum would be p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not quite. So perhaps that's the intended approach.

But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would have higher energy than the (v=0, J=1) state. So that can't be the next state, since (v=0, J=1) is lower in energy.

Hmm, this is confusing. So perhaps the problem is considering only vibrational transitions and not rotational?

But the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so it should consider both. So the next state is (v=0, J=1).

But the momentum I calculated for that is much smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the moment of inertia.

μ=40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.011e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.011e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I =3.011e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2044e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2*1.2044e-46) = (1.112e-68)/(2.4088e-46) = approx 4.616e-23 J.

So E_J=1 is 2B =9.23e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.23e-23 J, which is 9.23e-23 J.

Then p= E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.077e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all much larger.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering a transition that increases both J and v.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is in the 'fundamental state' which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) but with some rotational state, but the next state is the next allowed state in the model, which could be a combination.

Wait, but no, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy" — that should be the first state higher than the current one, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

So the (v=0, J=1) state is the next state.

But the energy is 9.23e-23 J, which is much lower than the options.

Hmm... Maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let's think about the energy of the photon needed to cause a transition from the ground state to the next state.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational one. Then the photon's energy would be h w, which is 2.65e-19 J. Then the momentum p = E/c = 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half that. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, did I compute h*w correctly?

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

So, if the photon's momentum is 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

So looking for 8.8e-28 Ns. The options are A:1.9e-28, D:1.4e-28... Hmm, none match exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects to take into account the rotational energy as part of the transition. Let me think: perhaps the molecule is in a state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which requires the photon to supply both the vibrational and rotational energy. But wait, no, because once v increases, the vibrational energy jumps much higher than the rotational.

Wait, no, because (v=1, J=0) has energy E_v=3.975e-19 J and E_J=0, so total E=3.975e-19.

The (v=0, J=1) state has E=1.325e-19 +9.23e-23 ≈1.3259e-19 J.

So to go to (v=0, J=1), the photon's energy is 9.23e-23 J.

But that's way smaller than the options.

Wait, maybe the question is about a transition to the next state, which is a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should have used the non-rigid rotor model, where the moment of inertia depends on the vibrational state. Oh, but for the fundamental state (v=0), the bond length is at its equilibrium, so I is fixed. So the calculation should be the same.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the dipole transition selection rules are Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1. So when a photon is absorbed, v increases by 1 and J increases by 1.

Wait, but in that case, the transition would be from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), but that might not be the next state with the lowest energy.

Wait, but the (v=1, J=0) state isn't allowed? No, because the rotational selection rule is ΔJ=±1, so if J=0, it can't go to J=0+1=1. Wait, no, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1. So from J=0, you can go to J=1.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The selection rule for electric dipole transitions is ΔJ = ±1. So in a vibrational transition, the rotational state can change by ±1.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change its vibrational state (Δv=±1) and rotational state (ΔJ=±1). So the transition from (v=0, J=0) could be to (v=1, J=1) or (v=1, J=-1, which is not possible), but J can't be negative. So the only possibility is (v=1, J=1).

But wait, if the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), can it transition to (v=0, J=1)? Because in that case, there's no change in vibrational state, just rotational. But that might be possible if the transition is purely rotational. But perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, which would require a change in v.

But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0), as I calculated earlier.

But why is that? Because the vibrational energy is much larger than the rotational energy. So the (v=0, J=1) state is just 9e-23 J higher than the ground state, while the (v=1, J=0) is 2.65e-19 J higher.

So the next state is (v=0, J=1). But again, the photon's momentum comes out to be about 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, the options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 kg m/s. So perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, J = kg m²/s². Momentum is kg m/s.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for E_photon.

Wait, the energy difference is 9.23e-23 J. So E_photon = 9.23e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 = 3.077e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but 3.077e-31 is 3.077e-5 times 1e-27 kg m/s. So 3e-5 times option A (1.9e-28) is about 5.7e-33, which isn't matching.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon with energy 2.65e-19 J, hence p=8.8e-28 kg m/s. That's close to option A (1.9e-28), but not quite. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the vibrational energy as the transition, not the rotational one. Because 8.8e-28 is about 1e-28, which is one of the options. Wait, option D is 1.4e-28. Hmm, no, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me recalculate h*w.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So p = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of what I calculated. Where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0 to v=1, but without the 1/2 factor in the energy. Because sometimes the vibrational energy is written as E_v = h w (v + 1/2 ). So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w (1) = h w.

So my calculation is correct. So the photon's momentum would be 8.8e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) but that's about half the value I got. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum as p = h f / c, but sometimes people use f = w/(2π), so perhaps I should use f=w/(2pi).

Wait, because angular frequency w is 2π f. So f = w/(2pi) = 4e14 / (2pi) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

But Planck's equation is E = h f. So E_photon = h * (w/(2pi)).

Wait, if I made that mistake earlier, then E would be h w / (2 pi) = (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/(2pi )= (2.65e-19 )/(6.283)=approx 4.2e-19 J.

Then p=E/c =4.2e-19 /3e8 = 1.4e-27 kg m/s.

Which is option B: 2.3e-27, but no, option D is 1.4e-28? Wait, no. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is 100 times smaller.

Wait, my calculation now gives 1.4e-27 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.3e-27, option C is 1.1e-27, and option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, 1.4e-27 is not an option. The closest is option B (2.3e-27) or option C (1.1e-27).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rotational energy difference. But earlier that gave me 3e-31, which is way too small.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the photon's momentum in terms of the given data without calculating the exact energy.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by:

E = E_v + E_J = [ (v + 1/2 ) h w ] + [ B J (J+1) ]

So for the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), the energy difference is:

ΔE = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = B [1*(1+1) - 0 ] = 2 B.

So ΔE = 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2 B.

Now, B is the rotational constant: B = ħ²/(2 I ) = (h²)/(8 pi² I) * (1/(2 I)) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute B.

But earlier, I found B = 4.616e-23 J.

So 2B=9.23e-23 J.

Then, E_photon=9.23e-23 J.

p_photon=9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.077e-31 kg m/s.

But again, this is way smaller than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to match the fundamental vibrational energy, which is h w / 2.

Wait, the fundamental state is v=0, which has E_v= (1/2) h w. The next vibrational state is v=1, with E_v= (1/2) h w + h w = 3/2 h w.

So the energy difference is (3/2 h w ) - (1/2 h w ) = h w.

Which brings me back to the same calculation as before, giving p=8.8e-28 kg m/s.

But the options are way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I might have forgotten a factor somewhere. Let's recompute B step by step.

Compute μ again: Mx=20, My=2. So μ=(20*2)/(20+2)=40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg = let me compute that.

1.81818 *1.6605 = approx 3.011.

So μ=3.011e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I= μ r² =3.011e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.011e-27 *4e-20 =1.2044e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2 I).

Compute ħ: 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ²= (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So B= (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.2044e-46 ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4088e-46 ≈ 4.616e-23 J.

So E_J=1 =2B=9.23e-23 J.

So p_photon = 9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational part. Maybe the model is treated as a simple harmonic oscillator, and the rotational part is ignored for this transition.

In that case, the photon's energy would be the vibrational energy difference, which is h w. So E_photon=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Then p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe I used the wrong value for the angular frequency. Wait, the problem states w=4e14 rad/s. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental transition, which is the first rotational state, but I'm not seeing how that ties into the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum p for the rotational transition.

p_photon = E_photon / c =9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.077e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are much larger. So unless I made a mistake in the calculation, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the photon to provide the energy for a transition that changes both v and J. But I don't see how that would result in a lower energy state than (v=0, J=1).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the first possible transition, which is to (v=1, J=0), which would require a much higher energy, but then the momentum would be 8e-28, which is close to option A.

But the options don't have 8e-28. The closest is option A, which is 1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between (v=0, J=0) and (v=0, J=1).

E_photon=9.23e-23 J.

Now, how does this compare to the options in terms of momentum?

p =9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.077e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.077e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options, D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28.

Wait, but 3.077e-31 is 0.003077e-27, which is 3.077e-28, which is close to option D (1.4e-28) but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering multiple-photon transitions or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions, but I don't see how that would make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model and the bond length changes during vibration, which affects the moment of inertia. But calculating that would complicate things a lot, and I'm not sure how to approach it without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, which is p=8.8e-28, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28), but I'm not seeing the relation.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake in the vibrational energy. Let me recompute.

h*w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the given data without using the exact numbers.

Wait, let's compute B again, but using symbols to see if there's a shortcut.

B = ħ²/(2I) = ( (h/(2pi) )^2 ) / (2 * μ r² )

= h²/(4 pi²) ) / ( 2 μ r² )

= h²/(8 pi² μ r² )

But I'm not sure that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the momentum to be the same as the vibrational energy, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. But that would be E= h w + 2B.

But that would give E=2.65e-19 +9.23e-23 = approx 2.65e-19 J.

So p=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Again, same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations don't align with the options given. It could be that I made a mistake in the approach, or perhaps the question expects a different consideration.

Wait, perhaps the question is talking about the molecule transitioning from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, regardless of rotation. So the energy is h w, which gives p=8.8e-28, which is approximately option A (1.9e-28), but that's about half. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for h or c.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using w as the wavenumber, but no, the question states w is angular frequency.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass incorrectly. Let me check the reduced mass calculation again.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) )= (20 *2 ) / (22 ) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition from (v=0, J=1) to (v=1, J=1), which would require a photon with energy h w, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum as the rotational contribution only, which would give 3e-31 kg m/s, but that's not any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the question is flawed, but since I have to choose from the options, maybe the intended answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

I= μ r² = (20*2/(22)) * (1.66e-27 kg) * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute I in a different way.

Wait, μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 = 1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.66e-27 kg.

So μ=1.818 *1.66e-27=3.01e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I= μ r²=3.01e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.01e-27 * 4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg m².

B= ħ²/(2 I)= (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.204e-46) = (1.112e-68)/(2.408e-46) =4.616e-23 J.

E_J=1=2B=9.23e-23 J.

So p=9.23e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way below the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which has an energy difference of h w.

So E_photon= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p_photon=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28).

Hmm, but it's approximately half the value.

Wait, perhaps the question is using w as the wavenumber (cm^-1), which is different from angular frequency. Because sometimes confusion arises between w (angular frequency) and wavenumber.

Wait, the angular frequency w is related to wavenumber (nu_bar) by w= c * nu_bar, where c is the speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, if the problem had given w as the wavenumber, then w=4e14 cm^-1. But angular frequency would be w= c * nu_bar.

Wait, let me compute that.

c=3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So if w were a wavenumber of 4e14 cm^-1, then angular frequency would be w= c * nu_bar=3e10 cm/s *4e14 cm^-1=1.2e25 rad/s. That can't be right because then h w would be way too big.

But the problem states that w is 4e14 rad/s, so I think that's correct.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the only relevant transition that makes sense is the vibrational one, which gives a photon momentum of 8.8e-28 kg m/s. But none of the options match exactly. Since option A is 1.9e-28, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the angular frequency as 4e14 Hz instead of radian. No, the question clearly states w in rad/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reduced mass in atomic mass units and not convert to kg. Wait, no, because the formula for B requires I in kg m².

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to choose the option without considering the rotational part. So the photon's momentum would be based on the vibrational energy, leading to option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27, which is 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

Wait, 1.1e-27 kg m/s is 1.1e-27 Ns.

But 1.1e-27 is 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

Wait, what if I took the rotational energy and multiplied by something?

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0).

The next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon with energy 2B.

So let's compute 2B.

Earlier, B=4.616e-23 J.

2B=9.23e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p= E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8=3.077e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way smaller than the options.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the photon's momentum is the same as the molecule's momentum. No, that doesn't make sense because the photon imparts momentum to the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the photon's momentum in the center of mass frame, but I don't think that's the case.

I'm really stuck here. Based on the calculations, the only relevant transition is the vibrational one, but that gives a momentum not matching any option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the rotational energy, but that gives a value much smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as p= h * (w)/(c). Because sometimes people confuse E= h f = h c /lambda, but if they used E = h w, which would be incorrect because w is in radians.

Wait, that would be wrong, but perhaps the problem made that mistake.

If someone mistakenly uses E= h w, then E_photon=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J, same as before.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.8e-28 kg m/s. But again, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using E= hc w, which would be wrong, but let's see.

E= hc w =6.626e-34*3e8 *4e14 =7.95e-11 J, which is way too big.

But that's not matching anything.

I'm at a loss. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to consider the first possible transition after the fundamental state, which is the first vibrational state, and the intended answer is option A.

But I can't reconcile the calculations. Given the options, and my calculations, I think the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is initially in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:  
   The total energy of the molecule is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies:  
   \[
   E = E_v + E_J
   \]  
   where \(E_v = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + h \omega v\) is the vibrational energy and \(E_J = B J (J+1)\) is the rotational energy, with \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}\) being the rotational constant. The moment of inertia \(I = \mu r^2\), where \(\mu\) is the reduced mass and \(r\) is the bond length.

2. **Reduced Mass and Moment of Inertia**:  
   The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.011 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]  
   The bond length \(r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Thus, the moment of inertia is:  
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = 3.011 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2044 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant and Energy Difference**:  
   The rotational constant \(B\) is:  
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2044 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.616 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   For the transition from \(J=0\) to \(J=1\), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.616 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} = 9.232 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the rotational transition:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{9.232 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.077 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  
   This value is much smaller than the options provided, suggesting the problem may not prioritize rotational transitions.

5. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy difference between \(v=0\) and \(v=1\) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  
   This value is closest to option **A** (\(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}\)), though it is approximately half the calculated value.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The analysis suggests that the problem likely intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, as the rotational transition results in a momentum far smaller than the provided options. Among the given choices, the closest match to the calculated vibrational transition momentum is **option A**.

Answer: A
