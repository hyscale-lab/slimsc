Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm not super confident about this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d looks like. Wait, wait, I think 1-bromobenzene would have a bromine attached to the benzene ring at the first position. But the "-2-d" part is a bit confusing. Oh, right! "d" stands for deuterium. So, deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, right? So, in benzene derivatives, the numbering is important. So, 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene would have a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so maybe the positions aren't as straightforward. If the bromine is at position 1, then the deuterium is at position 2. So, the molecule looks like a benzene ring with Br at one carbon, and D (deuterium) at the adjacent carbon.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base. In the context of aromatic substitution, especially dehydrohalogenation, maybe. Alternatively, I've heard about eliminations and dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aliphatic compounds, but what about aromatic rings?

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a ring contraction or expansion? Or perhaps it's a demethylation or dehalogenation. Wait, but wait, benzene rings are pretty stable. I'm a bit rusty on this.

Wait, another angle: NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aromatic chemistry, sometimes when a ring has strong activating groups, you can get elimination. But bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, so maybe it's a deactivating group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of elimination where the Br and D (deuterium) are adjacent, so when removed, they form a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a conjugated ring. Oh wait, in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen. If we have a Br at position 1 and a D at position 2, perhaps the reaction can abstract a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to Br. Wait, but D is not a proton; it's a heavier isotope.

Wait, wait, but the solvent is ammonium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia. So, the conditions are strongly basic. In aromatic substitution, sometimes under such conditions, especially with electron-withdrawing groups, elimination can occur. Maybe it's an example of the Claisen or some similar elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, this might be about dehalogenation. Wait, but dehalogenation usually requires specific conditions. For instance, using Zn/HG or other metals. I'm not sure NaNH2 does that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the deuterium is part of a leaving group. Wait, but D is a very poor leaving group. Normally, you need a good leaving group for elimination. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzidine-type elimination? No, I think that's more about aliphatic amines.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. In aliphatic systems, when you have a structure like CH2CH2Br, treating with a strong base can abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. But in the aromatic case, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br.

Wait, but in this case, the Br is attached to the benzene ring. So, if the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2, then perhaps the D is at position 2, which is adjacent to the Br. So, maybe the base will abstract that deuterium, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate or some elimination.

Wait, wait, benzene rings can form triple bonds (like in benzynes) under certain conditions. So, perhaps the reaction involves removing the Br and adjacent D, leading to a triple bond. Let me think: If you have adjacent Br and D, removing both would leave a triple bond between those two carbons.

Wait, but in that case, perhaps the product would be a triple bond. Let's see: 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene would lose Br and D, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2, making a benzyne (but with a deuterium? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe the D is lost as HD, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is removed as Br⁻, and the D is abstracted as D⁻, and then the two adjacent carbons form a triple bond, making a benzene ring with a triple bond—so a diradical or a benzyn intermediate.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the mechanism here. Alternatively, maybe the Br is a leaving group, and the base abstracts a hydrogen (or deuterium) leading to the formation of a benzyn. Wait, but in aromatic systems, forming a triple bond can lead to some interesting products.

Wait, okay, let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

2. Treatment with NaNH2 in NH3(l). NaNH2 is a strong base, and the solvent is liquid ammonia, which is a good solvent for such reactions.

3. So, the base (NH2⁻) may abstract a proton or deuterium from a position adjacent to the Br. Wait, but the adjacent position is the 2-position, which has a deuterium. So, the base could abstract that D.

4. Then, the Br leaves as Br⁻, and the D is abstracted, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2.

5. This would form a triple bond, making the ring a benzyn (aryne) structure. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait, what about the stereochemistry? When you form a triple bond, you have a ring with a triple bond, which can undergo various reactions, but in this case, maybe it's simply the elimination product.

So, if the reaction leads to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, then the product would be benzene with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, since the ring is symmetric, would the position of the triple bond be the same regardless of where the Br was removed?

Wait, no, because the Br was at position 1, and the D at 2, so the triple bond would be between 1 and 2. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the product would have the triple bond between 1 and 2, which is the same as between 2 and 1 in terms of the ring's structure. So, it would be a single product.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction can proceed via different pathways, leading to different products. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the deuterium is not at position 2. Wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Wait, the question is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, the main substituent is bromine at position 1, and deuterium at position 2. So, the positions are adjacent.

But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, the substituents are at adjacent positions.

Another thought: When the base abstracts the D, perhaps it's from either the ortho position (position 2) relative to Br, which is position 1. So, after abstraction, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms.

But wait, in such a reaction, if the triple bond forms, how many possible products can form? Because the ring could form a triple bond in more than one way, leading to different products. Or maybe it's a single product because the ring's symmetry makes all possibilities identical.

Wait, but in the case of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, the ring would have two substituents if there are any, but in this case, after elimination, the ring would have a triple bond, so the structure would be the same regardless of where the triple bond starts.

Wait, perhaps there's another possibility. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed through elimination but instead through some substitution. But bromine is a leaving group, and NaNH2 is a strong base, so elimination is more likely, especially since the deuterium is adjacent.

Wait, another thought: Could the base abstract a different deuterium? Wait, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the only deuterium is at position 2. Are there any other hydrogens that could be abstracted adjacent to Br? Wait, in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen unless substituted. So, position 1 has Br, position 2 has D, and position 6 has H. Are position 6 and position 1 adjacent? Wait, in benzene, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a ring. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So, position 6 has a hydrogen, but it's adjacent to the Br at position 1.

Wait, but in the starting material, only position 2 has a deuterium. So, perhaps the base could abstract either the H from position 6 or the D from position 2. Wait, but deuterium is a heavier isotope and less reactive. Hmm, but NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it can abstract deuterium as well, but perhaps preferentially abstracts regular H.

Wait, but in the starting material, the only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6. Because position 2 has a D, which is an isotope of H, but perhaps the base would abstract the H at position 6 instead.

Wait, but wait, the molecule's structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 as well. So, the H at position 6 is another possibility for the base to abstract.

Ah, so perhaps there are two possible sites for deprotonation: position 2 (D) and position 6 (H). But wait, position 2 is a D, so if the base abstracts that, it's possible, but perhaps it's more likely to abstract the H at position 6 because D is less reactive.

But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Do deuterium's have a lower pKa than H? I think the pKa of D is slightly higher than H, so it's harder to abstract. So, the base might prefer to abstract the H at position 6.

Wait, but in that case, the elimination would occur between position 1 (Br) and position 6 (H abstracted). That would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so 1-6 is the same as 1-2 in terms of the ring structure, but as a different position. Hmm, no. Wait, no, because in benzene, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So, if you eliminate between 1 and 2, you get a triple bond between those two. If you eliminate between 1 and 6, you get a triple bond between 1 and 6. But in benzene, the positions 1-2-3-4-5-6 are arranged in a ring, so triple bonds are similar regardless of where they are. But in terms of the product, each elimination would give a different product, but due to the ring's symmetry, perhaps they are the same.

Wait, but in the starting material, the Br is at position 1, and the D is at position 2. So, position 6 is across the ring. So, if the base abstracts position 6's H, elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But in benzene, the positions are symmetric, so a triple bond between 1 and 6 is equivalent to a triple bond between 1 and 2? Wait no, because the numbering is specific. So, perhaps the product would be the same regardless of whether the elimination is between 1-2 or 1-6, but in reality, when the Br is at 1 and the D at 2, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. So, would elimination from position 2 (D) or position 6 (H) lead to different products?

Wait, perhaps if the base abstracts the D at 2, elimination leads to a triple bond between 1 and 2, whereas if it abstracts H at 6, it forms a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, in the benzene ring, the positions are equivalent in a sense that a triple bond between 1-2 is the same as between 1-6, but in reality, the products would have the triple bonds in different positions, leading to different isomers.

Wait, but wait, in reality, when you form a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, the ring's symmetry may cause the products to be identical. Wait, let me think about benzene. If the triple bond is between 1-2, the structure is the same as if it's between 1-6 because of the ring's symmetry. No, actually, no. Because in benzene, each position is equivalent by rotation, but when you have a substituent, the positions become fixed. But in this case, after elimination, the substituents are the triple bonds, which are in fixed positions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about it differently. When the Br and D are adjacent, elimination would form a triple bond between those two positions. Similarly, if the Br is at position 1 and there's a H at position 6, elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But in the starting material, the D is at position 2, so the only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6. So, perhaps the base abstracts the H at position 6, leading to elimination of Br and H as Br⁻ and HD, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but then the product would be benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 6. But in benzene, that's the same as a triple bond between 1 and 2, but no, because the numbering would change. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 2, but wait, in the starting material, the D is at 2, so maybe after elimination, the triple bond would be between 1 and 2, but that would require the D to be abstracted.

Wait, but the D is at position 2. So, if the base abstracts the D from position 2, then the Br at position 1 and D at position 2 would both be removed, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 2. Alternatively, if the base abstracts the H at position 6, then the Br at position 1 and H at position 6 are removed, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6.

So, in that case, there would be two possible products, each with a triple bond in a different position relative to the original substituents. But wait, in benzene, all the positions are equivalent. So, perhaps the products are actually the same, so only one product is formed.

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the structure.

Imagine a benzene ring with Br at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. In the starting material, position 2 has a D, and position 6 has an H.

So, when NaNH2 is added, the base can abstract either the D at position 2 or the H at position 6.

If the base abstracts the D at position 2, then the Br at 1 and D at 2 are removed, forming a triple bond between 1 and 2.

If the base abstracts the H at position 6, then Br at 1 and H at 6 are removed, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Now, the question is: Are these two triple bonds in different positions, leading to two different products, or are they the same due to the ring's symmetry?

In benzene, the positions 1-2 and 1-6 are adjacent, but the structure would be the same after elimination because the ring can rotate. Wait, no, benzene is a planar ring with delocalized electrons, so the positions don't rotate; the numbering is fixed. Therefore, the products would be different depending on which H or D is abstracted.

But wait, in the starting material, the D is at position 2, and the H at position 6. So, if the base abstracts D from position 2, the triple bond is between 1 and 2. If it abstracts H from 6, the triple bond is between 1 and 6. So, these are two distinct products.

But wait, can the base abstract both D and H? Or is the base selective?

Given that D is an isotope of H, but with a slightly higher pKa (I think deuterium's pKa is around 35-40, while H's pKa is around 15-20). So, NaNH2 is a strong base, with a pKa of around 38 (I think). Wait, no, NaNH2 has a basicity higher than that. Wait, the pKb of NH2⁻ is around 2.5, which corresponds to a pKa of about 11.5 for NH3. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the pKa of D is about 35, and H is about 15. So, the base strength of NaNH2 is enough to deprotonate H (since pKa of H is 15, and NaNH2's pKa is around 38? Or wait, no, the conjugate acid of NaNH2 is NH2⁻, so the pKa would be the pKa of NH2⁻. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this confused. Let me think: The pH of a solution of NaNH2 in liquid NH3 is around 35, which suggests that the pKa of NH3 is about 35 in this solvent. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, the pKa of the solvent might affect the acidity. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract both D and H, but maybe the H is more acidic. So, the base would prefer to abstract the H at position 6, leading to the formation of the triple bond between 1 and 6. Would that be the case?

But wait, the starting material has a D at position 2 and H at position 6. So, when the base abstracts a proton, it could abstract either, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't differentiate and both eliminations are possible, leading to two distinct products.

Wait, but wait, if the base abstracts the D, the reaction would form a triple bond between 1 and 2. If it abstracts the H, it forms between 1 and 6. So, two different products. But would the structure after elimination be the same, or different?

Another thought: Maybe the reaction leads to the same product regardless of which position is eliminated. Because the ring can rotate, but in reality, the positions are fixed.

Wait, but in the starting material, the D is at position 2, which is one specific position. So, the two possible eliminations would lead to two different products in terms of their structure, but perhaps they are actually the same due to the ring's symmetry.

Wait, no, because if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, that's a different structure than between 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait, in benzene, the positions are arranged such that after elimination, the ring would have a triple bond either between 1-2 or 1-6. Are these two different structures?

Yes, because the positions are fixed. For example, imagine the ring as a hexagon with Br at position 1. If the D is at position 2, elimination there would give a triple bond between 1 and 2. If the H is abstracted from position 6, elimination would give a triple bond between 1 and 6. So, these are two different positions for the triple bond, leading to two different products.

But wait, wait. Another possibility: when the triple bond forms, the ring can undergo ring flipping, making the triple bond appear in different positions. But no, the ring doesn't flip in such a way that the triple bond's position would change. The triple bond is fixed in its position once formed.

So, that would mean two possible products. However, wait a second. Let me think again. The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. So, perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium, leading to elimination of Br, forming a triple bond between 1 and 2. But since the only deuterium is at position 2, and the H is at 6, perhaps the base would only abstract the H, because deuterium is less acidic.

Wait, but the base is NaNH2, which is a strong base, so it can abstract both H and D. But which is more favorable? D is less acidic, so perhaps H is abstracted more readily. So, the base would abstract the H at position 6, leading to elimination of Br and H, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, in that case, the product would have the triple bond between 1 and 6, which is a different structure than if the D is abstracted. So, does that mean two possible products?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because the triple bond can form in either position, but due to the ring's symmetry, they are the same. But I don't think that's the case because the positions are distinct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the starting material again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, position 2 has D, position 6 has H. So, the possible sites for elimination are between 1 and 2 (using D) and 1 and 6 (using H). So, if both eliminations are possible, there would be two products.

But wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction leads to more than one product, but some of them are the same due to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought, and there's a different product.

Wait, another angle: Could this reaction be a dehalogenation, removing the Br and the adjacent D, forming a new bond and releasing HBrD? But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction or something similar, but that usually involves multiple steps and different conditions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Reacting with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia. The base could abstract a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br and the abstracted H (or D), forming a triple bond.

So, the products would be benzene with a triple bond between positions 1-2 or 1-6, depending on which H/D is abstracted.

But in reality, how many possible products are formed?

If the base can abstract the H at position 6, then product A is benzene with triple bond 1-6.

If the base abstracts the D at position 2, product B is benzene with triple bond 1-2.

So, two different products.

Wait, but another possibility: when the base abstracts the D at position 2, then the Br at 1 and D at 2 are removed, forming a triple bond between 1 and 2. Similarly, abstraction of H at 6 would form triple bond between 1 and 6. So, two products.

But wait, another angle: Could the reaction lead to more than one product due to different regiochemistry or other factors?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single product because the triple bond can form in either position, but the product is the same due to ring symmetry. But I don't think so because the triple bond would be in a different position relative to the original substituents.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the other positions (3,4,5) are all H. So, if the base abstracts H from position 6, elimination occurs between 1 and 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6. Alternatively, if it abstracts D from 2, elimination occurs between 1 and 2.

So, these are two distinct products.

Wait, but in reality, can the base abstract both H and D? Or is one preferred over the other?

The pKa of H is around 15, and D is around 35. The conjugate acid of the base (NH2⁻) has a pKa of about 38. So, the base can abstract H (since pKa of H is 15 < 38), but for D, pKa 35 < 38, so the base can abstract D as well. So, both H and D can be abstracted, leading to two different products.

So, the reaction would give two different products: one with triple bond between 1 and 2, and the other between 1 and 6. Hence, two possible products.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: Maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a single product because the base can only abstract the more acidic H, which is in position 6. Because D is less acidic, the base would prefer to abstract the H at position 6, leading to only one product.

But wait, the pKa of D is higher, so the H is more acidic, so the base would prefer to abstract the H. So, in this case, the H at position 6 is more likely to be abstracted, leading to only one product.

Wait, but the starting material has a D at position 2. So, the D is present, but the H at position 6 is also present.

So, the base can abstract either, but since H is more acidic, it would prefer to abstract that, leading to one product.

But wait, the question is about the number of possible products. If both eliminations are possible, then two products would form. But the reaction may favor one pathway over the other, leading to predominantly one product.

Hmm, but the question is about how many possible products there are, not the major product. So, if both eliminations are possible, then two products would form.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe the reaction doesn't lead to elimination but instead to substitution. But in this case, substitution would require a good nucleophile. NaNH2 is a strong base but perhaps not a good nucleophile in this case, especially since the ring is deactivated by the Br.

Wait, but substitution is unlikely here because Br is a meta director and a poor leaving group in aromatic substitution without a proper mechanism (like under electrophilic conditions, which this isn't).

So, elimination is more likely.

So, if elimination occurs, and both H and D can be abstracted, leading to two products, then the answer would be 2.

But wait, another possibility arises: Maybe the base can abstract either the H or D, but the product would be the same because the triple bond can form in either position, but due to the ring's symmetry, it's the same product.

Wait, no, because the triple bond is in a different position relative to the substituents. Wait, but in this case, after elimination, the substituents are the triple bonds, so the positions are fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination can occur in either position, but the products are identical due to the ring's symmetry. For example, the triple bond between 1-2 and 1-6 would be the same because the ring can be rotated. But in benzene, the ring is symmetric, so any triple bond between adjacent positions would be the same, regardless of where you start. So, perhaps the products are the same.

Wait, that's a key point. So, the triple bond in benzene can form between any adjacent carbons, and due to the ring's symmetry, all such products would be identical.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the substituents (Br and D) are at positions 1 and 2. So, when the triple bond forms, it's between 1-2 or 1-6.

But in benzene, the positions 1-2 and 1-6 are adjacent carbons. If the triple bond forms between 1-2, then the structure is the same as if it formed between 1-6, because the ring can rotate, making the triple bond appear between any two adjacent positions.

Wait, but the positions are fixed. So, the triple bond between 1-2 is not the same as between 1-6, but in benzene, the ring's structure is such that any adjacent positions are equivalent. So, the product would be the same regardless of where the triple bond forms.

Wait, but the product would have a triple bond, but all triple bonds in benzene are the same structurally, regardless of where they are. So, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons. So, regardless of whether the base abstracts the D at position 2 or the H at 6, the product would be the same: a benzyn or benzyne structure.

Wait, but wait, if the triple bond forms between 1-2, the product would have substituents (like where the D was) in a certain orientation, but if it forms between 1-6, the substituents would be in a different orientation. But wait, in the product, after elimination, the ring has a triple bond, so the substituents (if any) would be attached to the carbons of the triple bond.

Wait, in this case, after elimination, the ring would have a triple bond, but the substituents (Br and D) would have been removed. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no: in the elimination, the Br and the H/D are lost as HBr (or HD or DBr or HDBr?), leaving a triple bond.

Wait, no, the elimination would lead to losing Br⁻ and H⁻ (or D⁻), but in reality, it's more likely to lose HBr and the H/D in the process. So, the product would have a triple bond, but no Br or D left.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the product is simply benzene with a triple bond between two adjacent positions. Since any adjacent positions are equivalent in benzene, the product would be the same regardless of where the triple bond forms.

So, in this case, regardless of whether the base abstracts the D at position 2 or the H at position 6, the product would be the same: a benzene ring with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons. Hence, only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait again. If the Br is at position 1, and the triple bond forms either between 1-2 or 1-6, but the product is the same because the ring can rotate. So, the triple bond could be between any two adjacent positions, and they are all the same.

Hmm, but that's only if the substituents are symmetrically placed, but in this starting material, substituents are fixed. So, wait, in the product, the ring has a triple bond, but the starting material's substituents (Br and D) are gone. So, the product is just benzene with a triple bond between two adjacent positions. So, that's the same as any other triple bond in benzene, regardless of where it is. So, only one product forms.

Wait, but that would mean the reaction gives only one product, which would correspond to option B.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to summarize:

- Reactant: 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

- Reagent: NaNH2 in NH3(l).

- Reaction: Base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of Br and H/D, forming a triple bond.

- Product: Benzene with a triple bond between two adjacent positions.

- Because the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond, regardless of where it is, due to the ring's symmetry, it's the same structure.

Therefore, only one product is formed.

Thus, the answer would be option B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2 on a benzene ring. The reaction proceeds via a base-catalyzed elimination mechanism. NaNH₂, a strong base, abstracts a proton or deuterium adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of Br⁻ and the formation of a triple bond between the carbons at positions 1 and 2.

Key considerations include:

1. **Structure of the starting material**: Bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. The benzene ring is symmetric, but the substituents (Br and D) fix the positions relative to each other.

2. **Reaction mechanism**: The base abstracts a proton or deuterium adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of Br⁻ and the formation of a triple bond. The abstraction can occur at position 2 (deuterium) or position 6 (hydrogen), as these are the positions adjacent to the bromine at position 1.

3. **Symmetry of the product**: Benzene is a symmetric planar ring, and a triple bond between any two adjacent carbons is structurally identical regardless of its position. Therefore, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between two adjacent positions, and the specific position of the triple bond does not lead to distinct isomers.

4. **Number of possible products**: Although the base can abstract either the deuterium at position 2 or the hydrogen at position 6, the resulting product is the same due to the symmetry of the benzene ring. Thus, only one unique product is formed.

In conclusion, the reaction produces a single product, which is benzene with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons.

Answer: B
