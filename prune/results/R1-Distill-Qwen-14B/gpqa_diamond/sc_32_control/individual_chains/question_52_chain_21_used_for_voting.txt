Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The part about the Ti (titanium) atoms is a bit trickier. The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We’re supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spot-free versus when it has spots. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, actually, the ratio depends on the energy difference between the levels and the temperature. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. But how does that affect the ratio n1/n2?

Wait, the observed ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when it doesn't. So the ratio goes down when the star is cooler. So we need to calculate the ratio when the star is at 6000 K and at 5500 K, and find the factor between them.

Wait, the ratio of levels is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). Let me think about E1 and E2. The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. But wait, the energy difference is proportional to 1/λ, right? So ΔE = hc/(λ).

But wait, let's calculate that. Let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (about 1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But to make this manageable, perhaps I should express it in terms of eV. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV. Wait, that seems high for a typical stellar line. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Wait, 6000 K is about a G-type star, similar to the Sun, but a bit cooler. But with spots, it's even cooler. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. Titanium lines in that region are common in stellar spectra.

But going back to the energy difference. Let me recalculate.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. That seems correct, but wait, that's a very large energy difference. For atomic energy levels, transitions of several eV are possible, but maybe for Ti, perhaps? Let me think. Titanium has several ionization stages, but in the neutral state, Ti I, the energy levels can have such differences, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and it's a high-energy transition.

But regardless, moving on. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming that g1/g2 is 1 for simplicity. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the statistical weights, so perhaps they are the same, or perhaps we're to assume they cancel out. So for this problem, let's ignore the statistical weights, or assume g1/g2 is 1. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). If E1 is higher than E2, then E1 - E2 is positive, so the exponential is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases if ΔE is positive.

But in our case, when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower. So the ratio is lower when the star is cooler. So (n1/n2)_hot / (n1/n2)_cool = factor.

Wait, no: the ratio when no spots is 6000 K, with spots is 5500 K. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots, so n1/n2 is higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K.

Wait, let's model it. Let me take T1 = 6000 K (no spots), T2 =5500 K (spots).

n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for T1: n1/n2 @ T1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For T2: n1/n2 @ T2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because:

[ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So, the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The ratio when no spots is R1 = n1/n2 at T1. When spots, R2 = n1/n2 at T2. The question says R decreases when the star has spots, so R1 > R2. So the factor is R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, that's correct.

Let me compute this exponent.

First, let me compute ΔE/(k) in terms of K. Because k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, but ΔE is in J, so let me compute ΔE/(k) to get units of K.

ΔE = 1.373e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ 1e5 ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that's 100,000 K.

So, the exponent becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is (1e5 K) * [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.6667e-4.

Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.

Multiply by 1e5: 1e5 * 1.513e-5 = 1.513.

So the exponent is approximately 1.513.

So the factor R1/R2 is exp(1.513).

What's exp(1.513)? Let me think. e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953. 1.513 is slightly less than 1.513 ≈ 1.513.

Wait, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. Let me calculate e^1.513.

We can approximate it. Let me compute 1.513 - 1.5 = 0.013.

We can use the Taylor expansion around 1.5: e^(1.5 + 0.013) ≈ e^1.5 * (1 + 0.013 + (0.013)^2/2 )

e^1.5 ≈4.4817.

So 4.4817 * (1 + 0.013 + (0.000169)/2) )

= 4.4817 * (1.013 + 0.0000845)

≈ 4.4817 * 1.0130845.

Compute 4.4817 * 1.013:

4.4817 * 1 =4.4817

4.4817 * 0.013 = 0.05826

Total ≈4.53996.

So approximately 4.54.

So the factor is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because the numbers might have been approximated too much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exponent more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute 1/T2 - 1/T1.

T1 =6000, T2=5500.

1/5500 = 0.000181818...

1/6000 = 0.000166666...

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166666 = 0.000015152.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) = 100,000 K.

So 0.000015152 * 100000 = 1.5152.

So exponent is 1.5152.

e^1.5152.

What's e^1.5152?

Looking up exact value:

We can use natural logarithm tables or a calculator, but since I'm doing this mentally, let me think about it.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, ln(4.6) is about 1.526.

Wait, wait, wait, let's see. Let me compute ln(4.5):

ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5)= ~1.504.

ln(4.6)=?

Well, e^1.5040 ≈4.5.

So e^1.5152 is a bit higher than 4.5.

But how much? Let me compute how much difference 0.0112 in the exponent (1.5152 -1.504=0.0112).

The derivative of e^x is e^x, so delta x=0.0112 → delta e^x ≈ e^x *0.0112.

At x=1.504, e^x=4.5. So delta is 4.5 *0.0112 ≈0.0504.

So e^1.5152 ≈4.5 +0.0504=4.5504.

So approximately 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the energy levels. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy difference is E1 - E2 = hc/lambda, but wait, the transition corresponds to the photon emitted when an electron drops from E1 to E2. So E1 > E2, so the energy difference is E1 - E2 = hc/lambda.

But in the Boltzmann equation, it's (E1-E2)/(k T), so that's correct.

Wait, but in the ratio n1/n2, when E1>E2, the ratio is higher when T is higher because the exponential term is larger (since higher T makes the exponent less negative).

Wait, let me think: if T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the exponential becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases with T.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower, so n1/n2 should be lower.

Which matches the observation that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So our calculation is correct.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spot-free (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Assuming \( g_1/g_2 = 1 \), the ratio of populations depends only on the exponential term.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy difference \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference between the levels corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor by which the ratio changes
The ratio of the populations at two temperatures \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots) is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

First, calculate \(\Delta E / k\) in terms of \(\text{K}\):

\[
\Delta E / k = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, calculate the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.513 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now, compute the exponent:

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (10^5)(1.513 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.513.
\]

Finally, calculate the factor:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.513) \approx 4.54.
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
