Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The production energy is 8 GeV, mass is 1.2 GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different distances. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think it involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity.

Wait, right, the mean decay length is usually given by the product of the lifetime (tau) and the particle's velocity (beta times c). So the formula is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau. But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²). Or is it, because the particle is moving at a certain energy?

Wait, mesons are bosons, but I'm not sure if that affects anything here. So, the steps I think I need to take are:

1. Find the lifetime of the meson. The width Gamma is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is about h-bar. So Gamma is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime. Or wait, the relation is Gamma = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, units might be tricky here. Gamma is given in MeV, but I need to convert that into appropriate units for the calculation. Because ħ has units of GeV·s or something, I think. Let me get that right.

H-bar (ħ) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh right, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant over 2pi is about 6.58e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, so Gamma is in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = h-bar / Gamma. So h-bar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let me calculate that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that's the lifetime.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since the particle is moving with production energy E = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. The energy of the particle is much higher than its rest mass, so it's moving relativistically.

The energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum through E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps I should work in units where c=1, but then I need to remember to include it when calculating the velocity.

Wait, another approach: the relativistic gamma factor is gamma = E/(m c²). But if we're working in units where c=1, then gamma = E/m. So here, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but velocity can be found from beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667. So (1/gamma)^2 is (3/20)^2 = (9/400) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c. Close to the speed of light.

Alternatively, since the particle's energy is much higher than its rest mass, we can approximate beta as approximately 1, but getting a more precise value is better for the calculation.

Alternatively, there's another way to compute beta. Because E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, so p = gamma m v. But E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc) = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2 ). So,

pc = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV ≈ sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So pc = 7.91 GeV. Then, p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

But also, E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → gamma = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) = 6.6667.

But another relation, p = gamma m v → v = p/(gamma m). But let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, p = gamma m v → v = p/(gamma m). But since E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). So v = (p * c )/(E).

Wait, because p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c²)^2 ), which is 7.91 GeV as computed earlier. So v = (p c )/ E → 7.91 GeV / 8 GeV → 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c. Which matches our previous calculation. So beta is approximately 0.98875.

So beta is about 0.98875, so v ≈ 0.98875 c.

Now, the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, because tau is the proper lifetime, so the dilated lifetime is gamma tau. So the time experienced in the lab frame is longer by gamma, and the distance is velocity times time. So L = v * gamma tau.

But wait, v is beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.

So let me compute that.

Gamma is 6.6667, beta is approximately 0.98875.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ about 6.611.

So L = 6.611 * c * tau.

Wait, but c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. Tau was found to be about 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute each part.

First, compute c * tau:

c = 3e8 m/s.

c * tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 6.1706e-16 meters.

Then multiply by gamma * beta, which is approximately 6.611.

So L ≈ 6.611 * 6.1706e-16 m.

Let me calculate that:

6.611 * 6.1706 ≈ let's compute:

6 *6 is 36, 0.611 *6.17 is about 3.765. So total is approximately 39.765. So 39.765e-16 m → 3.9765e-15 m.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the calculation step:

6.611 * 6.1706e-16 = ?

Wait, 6.611 *6.1706 is approximately 40.924, because 6 *6=36, 0.611 *6.1706 is about 3.767, so total about 39.767, which is roughly 39.77. So 39.77e-16 m is 3.977e-15 m. So L ≈ 3.977e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15.

Wait, my calculation got approximately 3.98e-15, but none of the options exactly match. Hmm, perhaps I need to be more precise in the calculations.

Let me recheck the steps.

First, finding tau: Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

Tau = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

Next, computing gamma: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Calculating beta: sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Wait, sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/64) = sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

But perhaps to get a more precise beta, compute that square root more accurately.

0.9775 is 0.9775. Let's compute the square root. Let's see, 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775, right?

0.9887 *0.9887 = (0.98 +0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2. 

0.98^2 = 0.9604. 2*0.98*0.0087= approx 0.0172. 0.0087^2=0.00007569. So total is 0.9604 +0.0172=0.9776 + 0.00007569 ≈0.977675. So 0.9887^2 is about 0.977675. But our target is 0.9775. So the square root is a bit less than 0.9887.

So let's compute it precisely. Let me use a calculator approach.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) around x=0.225.

Wait, 1 - x = 0.9775 → x =0.0225.

So sqrt(1-x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/(8) for small x. Let's compute x=0.0225.

x/2=0.01125.

x²=0.00050625.

x²/8=0.00006328125.

So sqrt(1-x) ≈ 1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328 ≈ 0.98869.

But using a calculator, what's the actual sqrt(0.9775)?

Let me compute 0.988 squared: 0.988 * 0.988.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.008 = 0.00784.

0.008 * 0.98 = 0.00784.

0.008 *0.008=0.000064.

So 0.988^2 = (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064= 0.9604 +0.01568=0.97608 +0.000064=0.976144. Hmm, which is less than 0.9775.

So 0.988^2=0.976144.

What about 0.989^2: (0.988+0.001)^2 = 0.988² + 2*0.988*0.001 + 0.001² = 0.976144 +0.001976 +0.000001= 0.978121.

But 0.9775 is between 0.976144 and 0.978121, so sqrt(0.9775) is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Compute the difference: 0.9775 -0.976144= 0.001356.

The total range between 0.988^2 and 0.989^2 is 0.978121 -0.976144=0.001977.

So the fraction is 0.001356 / 0.001977 ≈ 0.685.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988 + 0.685*(0.001) = 0.988 +0.000685=0.988685.

So beta is approximately 0.988685.

So beta is about 0.9887.

So gamma * beta = (8/1.2) * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6666667 *0.9887 ≈ let's compute 6.6667 *0.9887.

6 *0.9887=5.9322; 0.6667 *0.9887≈0.6600, so total is approximately 6.5922.

Wait, 6.6667 *0.9887 = ?

Let me compute 6 *0.9887=5.9322.

0.6667 *0.9887 = approximately 0.6600.

So 5.9322 +0.6600=6.5922.

So gamma * beta ≈6.5922.

Now, L= gamma * beta * c * tau.

We have c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then, L=6.5922 *6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.5922 *6.170625:

Let me compute 6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.5922 *6.170625 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *6.170625=3.0853; 0.0922*6.170625≈0.5682. So total is approx 3.0853 +0.5682=3.6535.

So 6.5922 *6.170625 ≈37.02375 +3.6535≈40.67725.

So L≈40.67725e-16 m → 4.067725e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.068e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, in calculating c*tau:

c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then L = gamma * beta * c tau = 6.5922 *6.170625e-16.

Wait, 6.5922 *6.170625 = let me calculate more accurately.

6.5922 *6.170625 = ?

Break it down:

6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.5922 *6.170625.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625 =3.0853125.

0.0922 *6.170625.

0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625.

0.0022 *6.170625=0.013575375.

So 0.55535625 +0.013575375=0.568931625.

So 3.0853125 +0.568931625=3.654244125.

So total is 37.02375 +3.654244125=40.678 approx.

Wait, 37.02375 +3.654244125=40.677994125.

So 40.677994125e-16 m is 4.0677994125e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0678e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but why is option C 5e-15? Did I mix up any units?

Wait, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which I converted correctly to 0.32 GeV.

Energy E is 8 GeV, mass m is 1.2 GeV. Calculated gamma correctly as E/m=6.6667.

Beta calculation by sqrt(1 - (m²/E²) )=sqrt(1 - (1.44/64))=sqrt(0.9775)=0.988685.

So gamma * beta is 6.6667 *0.988685≈6.592.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in not accounting for all the decimals.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * tau) * (gamma beta).

If I compute everything more precisely.

Let me recompute gamma * beta with more precise values.

Gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2²)/(8² )) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(1-0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.988685126.

So gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.988685126 ≈ (6.666666667) *0.988685126.

Compute 6 *0.988685126=5.932110756.

0.666666667 *0.988685126= ?

Compute 0.666666667 *0.988685126.

0.666666667 *0.988685126 = (2/3)*0.988685126.

2/3 is approximately 0.666666667.

0.988685126 * (2/3) ≈0.659123417.

So total gamma*beta=5.932110756 +0.659123417 ≈6.591234173.

So gamma*beta≈6.591234173.

Now, c*tau =3e8 m/s * tau=3e8 * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L= 6.591234173 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.591234173 *6.170625.

Multiply 6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.591234173 *6.170625 → let's compute:

0.5 *6.170625 =3.0853125.

0.091234173 *6.170625.

Compute 0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625.

0.001234173 *6.170625≈0.007616.

So 0.55535625 +0.007616=0.56297225.

So 3.0853125 +0.56297225=3.64828475.

So total is 37.02375 +3.64828475=40.67203475.

So L=40.67203475e-16 m →4.067203475e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0672e-15 m.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C:5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, our computed value is approximately 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15). The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise calculations of beta and gamma.

Wait, perhaps my value for hbar is a bit off. I used hbar =6.582e-25 GeV·s. Maybe the exact value is different.

Wait, the precise value of hbar is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So that's correct.

So I think option B is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \).

### Step 1: Compute the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The total decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The energy of the particle is \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity factor \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \gamma \beta \)
\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.592.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( c \tau \)
\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the mean decay distance \( L \)
\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = 6.592 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
6.592 \times 6.170625 = 40.677994125,
\]
so:
\[
L \approx 40.677994125 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.0678 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The computed value \( L \approx 4.0678 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
