Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, decay distance... I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get τ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But I need to make sure about the units here.

So first, let's get the lifetime τ. Γ is given in MeV, which is energy. Planck's constant ħ is usually in units like GeV·s, so I need to convert Γ to GeV for consistency. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact relation is Γ = ħ * width in inverse time. So τ should be ħ / Γ.

What's the value of ħ in GeV·s? I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So let me compute τ.

τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) × 10^-25 s. Calculating 6.582 / 0.32: 6.582 ÷ 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me compute that division: 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 times 20 is 6.4. 6.582 -6.4 = 0.182. So 0.182 / 0.32 is about 0.56875. So yeah, 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25? No, wait, 6.582e-25 is 6.582 * 1e-25. Divided by 0.32 gives (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25. So 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check: 0.32 GeV is the width. So Γ = ħ * width in energy. Or perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where factors are different. Maybe I have it backwards. Alternatively, I might have the units mixed up, so perhaps I should use the relation Γ = ħ * (1/τ), so τ = ħ/(Γ) in appropriate units.

Wait, another approach: the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is produced with energy E = 8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass, so it's moving relativistically.

So I need to find the velocity, which requires me to compute the Lorentz factor γ. Because E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². But since units are in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², but let's see.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So gamma is E / m. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Then, beta is v/c. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let me compute that.

Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma squared is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So now, the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, wait. Because the lifetime is tau, but from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper time tau. So the lifetime observed is gamma * tau.

So the decay length is L = v * (gamma tau). Because v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, since the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, and the distance is v multiplied by that time. So yes, L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, but v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

So putting it all together:

L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

We have beta ≈ 0.9887, gamma = 6.6667, c is speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s. Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute gamma * tau: gamma is 6.6667, tau is 2.056875e-24 s. So 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ let's see: 6 * 2 is 12, 0.6667 * 2.056 is about 1.37. So total roughly 13.37e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute accurately: 2.056875e-24 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6667 * 2.056875 = approx 13.71, so 13.71e-24 s.

Then multiply by beta (0.9887) and c (3e8 m/s).

So L ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 13.71e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute that:

First, 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, 2.966e8 m/s multiplied by 13.71e-24 s is:

2.966e8 * 13.71e-24 = 2.966 * 13.71 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (approx 40.74) * 1e-16 = 4.074e-15 meters.

Wait, let's compute 2.966 *13.71:

2.966 * 13 = 38.558, 2.966 *0.71≈ 2.101. So total approximately 40.659.

So 40.659e-16 m is 4.0659e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So my calculation is approximately 4.0659e-15 m, which matches option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation steps. Maybe I made an error in gamma or beta.

Gamma is E/(m c²), but in natural units, E = gamma m, so yes, 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Beta: sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) = sqrt( (43.4444)/44.4444 )) = sqrt(0.9777) ≈ 0.9888. Yes.

So beta is about 0.9888.

Then, the lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. Wait, wait, the width is in GeV, so I need to make sure units are correct.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, yes, that's correct.

So gamma tau is 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 13.71e-24 s.

Multiply by beta: 0.9888 * 13.71e-24 ≈ 13.56e-24 s.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when I compute L, it's beta * c * gamma tau. So beta is 0.9888, gamma tau is 13.71e-24 s.

So beta * gamma tau = 0.9888 *13.71e-24 ≈ 13.56e-24 s.

Then, multiply by c, which is 3e8 m/s.

So 13.56e-24 s * 3e8 m/s = (13.56 *3) * 1e-16 m.

13.56 *3 = 40.68.

So 40.68e-16 m = 4.068e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.07e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Wait, so why is my calculation giving 4.068e-15, and option B is 4.0655e-15? Probably because I approximated some numbers. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me re-calculate each step with more precise numbers.

First, gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... exactly 20/3.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (3^2)/(20^2)) because gamma is 20/3.

Wait, gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9). So 1/gamma squared is 9/400=0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, 0.9888^2 = (0.9888)(0.9888). Let's compute 0.9888^2:

0.9888 * 0.9888: let's compute 0.9888 *0.9888.

Hmm, 0.98 *0.98 = 0.9604. 0.0088 *0.98 = 0.008624, and 0.98 *0.0088 = same. 0.0088 *0.0088 is 0.00007744. So cross terms: (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.9888^2 as (1 - 0.0112)^2 = 1 - 0.0224 + 0.00012544 = 0.97772544.

Wait, but 0.9888^2 is 0.97772544, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So the square of 0.98875 would be?

Alternatively, maybe I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9) ≈44.444444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is approximately... I'll use a calculator approach.

We know that sqrt(0.9775) is around 0.9887. Let me compute (0.9887)^2 = 0.97753169, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887. So that's accurate enough.

Next, tau: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Divide by Γ=0.32 GeV: 6.582e-25 /0.32.

6.582 /0.32: 0.32 × 20 =6.4. 6.582-6.4=0.182. 0.182/0.32=0.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 6.666666..., multiplying tau: 6.666666 *2.056875e-24 = let me compute that.

2.056875e-24 * 6.6666666667 = ?

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 12.34125e-24.

0.6666666667 *2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-24.

Adding together: 12.34125 + 1.37125 =13.7125e-24 s.

So gamma tau =13.7125e-24 s.

Multiply by beta (0.9887) and c (3e8 m/s).

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s.

Compute 0.9887 *3e8 = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 13.7125e-24 s:

2.9661e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s = 2.9661 *13.7125 * 1e-16 m.

Compute 2.9661 *13.7125:

Let me compute 2 *13.7125 =27.425.

0.9661 *13.7125: let's see. 0.9 *13.7125=12.34125. 0.0661 *13.7125≈0.908. So total≈12.34125 +0.908=13.24925.

So 27.425 +13.24925 =40.67425.

So 40.67425e-16 m = 4.067425e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations of beta or other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of beta.

Wait, let me compute beta more accurately.

Gamma = 20/3.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.988714.

So, more accurately, beta is ~0.988714.

Let me redo the calculation with this beta.

So, L = beta * c * gamma tau.

beta = 0.988714.

gamma tau = 13.7125e-24 s.

So 0.988714 *13.7125e-24 = approx 13.7125 *0.988714 ≈13.55e-24 s.

Wait, 13.7125 *0.988714: let me compute it.

13.7125 * 0.988714 = ?

Let me compute 13.7125 * 0.988714.

First, 13.7125 *0.9 = 12.34125.

13.7125 *0.08 = 1.097.

13.7125 *0.008714 ≈0.1195.

Adding them: 12.34125 +1.097=13.43825, plus 0.1195 gives ~13.55775.

So beta* gamma tau ≈13.55775e-24 s.

Then multiply by c=3e8 m/s.

So 13.55775e-24 s *3e8 m/s = (13.55775 *3) *1e-16 m.

13.55775 *3=40.67325.

So 40.67325e-16 m =4.067325e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So probably due to more precise beta.

Alternatively, perhaps some other factors like using more precise values of ħ.

Wait, ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. If I use a more precise value, like 6.5823×10^-25, would that change it much?

Let me try ħ=6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

Then, tau = ħ/Γ =6.5823e-25 /0.32=20.5696875e-25=2.05696875e-24 s.

Gamma tau is 6.66666667 * 2.05696875e-24=?

6 *2.05696875e-24 =12.3418125e-24.

0.666666667 *2.05696875e-24=1.37125e-24.

Total: 12.3418125 +1.37125=13.7130625e-24 s.

Now, beta is 0.988714.

So, beta * gamma tau =0.988714 *13.7130625e-24=?

Let me compute 13.7130625e-24 *0.988714.

13.7130625 *0.988714 ≈ let's compute:

13.7130625 *0.988714 = ?

Split into 13.7130625 * (0.9 + 0.08 +0.008714).

0.9 *13.7130625=12.34175625.

0.08 *13.7130625=1.097045.

0.008714 *13.7130625≈0.11943.

Adding them: 12.34175625 +1.097045=13.43880125 +0.11943=13.55823125.

So 13.55823125e-24 s.

Multiply by c=3e8 m/s: 13.55823125e-24 *3e8=40.67469375e-16 m=4.067469375e-15 m.

So approximately 4.0675e-15 m. Again, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, I must be missing something. Perhaps the original calculation uses a different value for ħ. Or perhaps the exact calculation uses the actual relativistic expressions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta). Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, and the distance is velocity times that.

Wait, velocity v=beta c.

So L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c gamma tau.

Which is what I've done.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma * beta.

Gamma is 20/3 (~6.6667), beta is ~0.988714.

gamma * beta = (20/3)*0.988714 ≈6.6667 *0.988714=6.599 approximately.

Wait, 6.6667 * 0.988714:

6 *0.988714=5.932284.

0.6667 *0.988714≈0.65897.

Total ≈5.932284 +0.65897=6.59125.

So gamma * beta ≈6.59125.

Then, tau is 2.05696875e-24 s.

So L = (gamma beta) * c * tau.

Wait, no, because L = beta c gamma tau, which is beta * gamma * tau * c.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.0569e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (gamma * beta) * c * tau.

So 6.59125 * 3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59125 *3e8=1.977375e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.05696875e-24 s: 1.977375e9 *2.05696875e-24 = (1.977375 *2.05696875) *1e-15.

1.977375 *2.05696875 ≈ let's compute:

2*1.977375=3.95475.

But 2.05696875 is 2 + 0.05696875.

So 1.977375 *2 =3.95475.

1.977375 *0.05696875≈0.1123.

So total≈3.95475 +0.1123=4.06705.

So 4.06705e-15 m. Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Again, similar to before. So the value is about 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So considering possible rounding in the options, option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation used more precise values. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, another thing: the production energy is given as E_X=8 GeV. So when calculating gamma, is it E = gamma m c² or E = gamma m?

In natural units (where c=1), E = gamma m. So yes, gamma is E/m =8/(1.2)=6.6667.

But in real units, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², when you divide E by m, you get (GeV) / (GeV/c²) )= c². So gamma = (E/(m c²)).

Wait, wait no. Let me get this right.

E = gamma m c².

So gamma = E/(m c²).

But if E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², then E/(m c²) = (GeV) / ( GeV/c² * c² ) ) = GeV/(GeV) )= unitless.

So gamma is E/(m c²).

But in natural units, c=1, so gamma=E/m.

So, no, the calculation is correct as I did it earlier.

Wait, but to get gamma in terms of units, perhaps I should have considered this.

But in any case, the calculation gave me gamma=6.6667, which is correct.

Another thing to consider: perhaps I should calculate the velocity using beta = p/(E/c), where p is momentum.

But since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

So, beta = p c / E.

Hmm, let's compute it.

E =8 GeV, m c^2=1.2 GeV.

So, p c = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV.

Which is sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So, beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875.

Which is the same as before. So beta is 0.98875.

So, same as before. So I think my calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, with \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( \gamma = 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we compute:

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \tau \):

\[
\gamma \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 13.7125 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Then, multiply by \( \beta \) and \( c \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 13.7125 \times 10^{-24} \cdot 3 \times 10^8.
\]

Simplify:

\[
L = (0.9887 \cdot 13.7125) \cdot (3 \times 10^8 \cdot 10^{-24}).
\]

\[
L = 13.55775 \cdot 3 \times 10^{-16} = 40.67325 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

\[
L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest value to the calculated \( L \) is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
