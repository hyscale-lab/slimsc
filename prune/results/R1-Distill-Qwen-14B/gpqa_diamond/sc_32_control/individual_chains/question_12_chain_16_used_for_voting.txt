Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options give possible kinetic energies for the products.

Hmm, right, this is a decay problem, specifically a pion decay. I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their energies are determined by energy and momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

Let me jot down the given data. The rest mass of the pion (m_pi) is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon (m_mu) is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino is massless, I think, because its mass is negligible. So, m_nu is approximately zero.

Wait, but wait—neutrinos do have mass, but in many problems, especially in particle physics, they are treated as massless for simplicity. I'll proceed under that assumption unless told otherwise.

So, the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p. But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are the same. So |p1| = |p2| = p.

Now, for each particle, their total energy is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. Also, from the conservation of energy, the total energy of the products should equal the rest energy of the pion, because the pion is at rest and the initial kinetic energy is zero.

So, the total energy equation would be:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

E_pi is the rest energy of the pion: m_pi c². Since we're working in units where c=1 (as in MeV units), E_pi = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon: sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, actually, in natural units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²). Because E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So, E = sqrt( p² + m² ) when c=1.

So, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu = |p| (since for a massless particle, E = |p|).

Therefore, the energy equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p

Wait, let me write that equation down:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p

Hmm, so I can solve for p. Let me let x = p to make it easier.

So,

139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x

Let me rearrange that:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x²

So, subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x

Now, compute the squares:

105.7 squared is approximately 11173.49 (since 100²=10,000; 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49=11,172.49). Wait, let me calculate more accurately:

105.7 * 105.7: 100*105.7=10,570; 5.7*105.7= approx 5*105.7=528.5, 0.7*105.7≈73.99 → 528.5+73.99=602.49. So, 10,570 +602.49=11,172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19,321, and 0.6^2 is 0.36. Then, 2*139*0.6=166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6² =19,321 + 166.8 + 0.36 =19,488.16 MeV².

So, plugging the numbers:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 2*139.6 *x

Let's compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So,

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x

Let's subtract 19,488.16 from both sides:

11,172.49 -19,488.16 = -279.2 x

Which is:

-8,315.67 = -279.2 x

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = (-8,315.67)/(-279.2) ≈ 8,315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that: 279.2 * 30 = 8,376 → which is a bit more than 8,315. So 30 is a bit high. Let's see: 279.2 * 29.76 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps an approximate calculation:

279.2 × 29.76 ≈ 8,315.67 → So x ≈ 29.76 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait. Let me do the exact division.

8,315.67 ÷ 279.2 ≈ Let me compute:

279.2 × 29 = 8,096.8 (since 279 *30=8,370; subtract 279*1=279 → 8,370-279=8,091? Wait, wait, 279.2 ×29 → (279 ×29) + (0.2×29) → 279 ×29: 279*(30-1)=8,370-279=8,091. 0.2 ×29=5.8 → total 8,096.8.

But we have 8,315.67 as numerator. 279.2 *29=8,096.8. So 8,315.67 -8,096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So x ≈29.782 → approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try 29.78.

Double-checking:

279.2 ×29.78 = ?

Well, 279.2 ×30 =8,376 → 279.2 ×0.22= approx 61.424 → 8,376 - (279.2 ×0.22) = 8,376 - (approx 61.424) → 8,314.576.

Ah, so 279.2 *29.78 ≈8,314.576, which is close to our numerator 8,315.67. So x ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So, the momentum p is about 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78 squared: approx 887 MeV². 105.7 squared is 11,172.49. So sum is 11,172.49 + 887 ≈12,059.49 → sqrt ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, because 109.8^2 = 12,056.04, which is close to 12,059.49. So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

The neutrino's energy E_nu is p = 29.78 MeV.

So, the total energy is 109.8 + 29.78 ≈139.58 MeV, which is close to the pion's rest energy of 139.6 MeV. So that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is 109.8 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate that:

Wait, 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV. So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is its total energy, because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = p =29.78 MeV → KE_nu =29.78 MeV.

So, the kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that must be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the p calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me redo the calculation with more precision.

Let me recompute the equation:

139.6 = sqrt(x² +105.7²) +x

Let me subtract x from both sides: 139.6 -x = sqrt(x² +105.7²)

Squaring both sides:

(139.6 -x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side: 139.6² - 2*139.6 x +x² =x² + 105.7²

Subtract x² from both sides: 139.6² -2*139.6 x =105.7²

Compute the squares:

139.6² = 139.6 *139.6 → Let me compute more accurately.

139.6 *139.6:

Compute 140 *140 =19,600. But since it's 139.6, which is 140 -0.4.

So, (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 +0.4² =19,600 -112 +0.16 =19,488.16 MeV².

105.7² = 11,172.49 MeV².

So,

19,488.16 - 279.2 x =11,172.49

Subtract 11,172.49 from both sides:

19,488.16 -11,172.49 = 279.2 x

Which gives: 8,315.67 =279.2 x → x=8,315.67 /279.2 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So, the momentum p is about 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the muon's energy: E_mu =sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: 29.78 *29.78 → 29^2=841; 0.78^2=0.6084; cross term 2*29*0.78=44.04. So, (29+0.78)^2=29^2 + 2*29*0.78 +0.78^2 =841 +44.04 +0.6084=885.6484.

So, 29.78^2 ≈885.65 MeV².

105.7^2=11,172.49 MeV².

Total under the square root:11,172.49 +885.65=12,058.14 MeV².

Square root of 12,058.14 → let's see, 109.8^2=12,056.04. 109.8 squared is about 12,056. So, 109.8^2=12,056.04. So, 12,058.14 is a bit higher. The difference is 12,058.14 -12,056.04=2.1.

So, sqrt(12,058.14) ≈109.8 + (2.1)/(2*109.8) )=109.8 + (2.1/(219.6))=109.8 +0.00956 ≈109.80956 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

Wait, wait, 105.7 is exact? So, 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p=29.78 MeV. So, KE_nu=29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D:4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So, that matches our calculation.

So, the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV and the neutrino's is about 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the options again.

Option D says 4.12 and 29.8. So that's the one. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu,
\]

we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy, \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is massless (\(m_{\nu} = 0\)).

### Energy Conservation
The total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. The neutrino's energy is simply \(E_{\nu} = p\), as it is massless. Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and simplifying:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p.
\]
Substituting \(105.7^2 = 11,172.49\) and \(139.6^2 = 19,488.16\):
\[
11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 \cdot p.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
279.2 \cdot p = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49,
\]
\[
279.2 \cdot p = 8,315.67.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{8,315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Total Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]
Substituting \(p^2 = 29.78^2 \approx 885.65\) and \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11,172.49\):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{885.65 + 11,172.49} = \sqrt{12,058.14} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu}.
\]
Substituting \(E_{\mu} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
KE_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, as it is massless:
\[
KE_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
