Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the question is: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three solutions: 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But here, the problem is a bit more complex because we're mixing three solutions: two acids and a base. Or is it? Let me check: HCl is an acid, H2SO4 is a stronger acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So, acids and base are being mixed. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when it reacts with a base, it might donate two H+ ions.

But wait, the problem says they are mixed together, so the H+ ions from all acids will react with OH- ions from the base. So first, I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions to see which is in excess.

Let me compute the moles for each component.

First, HCl: it's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole gives one H+.

Next, H2SO4: it's a strong acid as well, but it's diprotic, so each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2: it's a strong base. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 0.2 L. So moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. OH- ions = 0.1 *2 =0.2 moles.

Wait, so total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles. So which is in excess? H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So H+ is in excess, meaning OH- will be neutralized, and there will be some H+ left.

But wait, since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, the first H+ is stronger and dissociates completely, but the second might not. Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second is weaker? Or wait, no, I think in aqueous solution, the first H+ dissociates completely, the second one does too but perhaps as a weaker acid. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Oh, but for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps we can consider all H+ ions available. Or do I need to calculate it differently?

Wait, maybe I shouldn't get too bogged down. Let's proceed under the assumption that all H+ from HCl and H2SO4 are available. So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So neutralization reaction will proceed until OH- is all used up.

The neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole of H+ and OH- produces one mole of water, releasing heat.

So the limiting reagent is OH-, which is 0.2 moles. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the amount of H+ consumed is 0.2 moles. The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. Since each mole of H+ from any acid contributes, the heat released depends on the moles of H+ neutralized.

So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * enthalpy per mole.

But what is the enthalpy per mole for neutralization? The standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each mole of acid contributes one H+ and each mole of base contributes one OH-).

Wait, but wait a second. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole of H2SO4 can provide two H+ ions. But when it reacts with a base, each H+ reacts with an OH- to form water. So the first H+ from H2SO4 is as strong as HCl, so it fully dissociates. But the second H+ (from H2SO4) is a weaker acid, so it may not dissociate completely. Hmm, but in a neutralization reaction, you might only get the first H+ reacting. Or does the solution assume that both are available?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. In strong acids, like HCl and H2SO4 (first dissociation), the H+ ions are fully released. But the second H+ in H2SO4 is a weaker acid (pKa around 1.99, I think), so in a solution, it doesn't fully dissociate unless in concentrated solutions or under certain conditions. But in this problem, since it's being mixed with a base, I'm not sure if the second H+ will react.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ from the acids are available. But that might not be correct. Let me think. For the purpose of this problem, perhaps we should consider that H2SO4 can contribute two H+ ions, but in a neutralization, only one H+ per H2SO4 reacts with the OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, when H2SO4 reacts with a base, the first H+ is a strong acid and dissociates completely, but the second H+ is a weak acid and may not dissociate. So in a neutralization reaction, perhaps only the first H+ from H2SO4 reacts. So the H2SO4 would contribute one H+ per mole for neutralization, and the second H+ might not be available.

Wait, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to treat all H+ as available, so for H2SO4, it's 2 H+ per mole. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try both approaches and see which makes sense.

Approach 1: Assume all H+ from H2SO4 is available.

So HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 mol (0.09 * 2), total H+ is 0.28. Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.2 mol OH-.

So they'll neutralize 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, since the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole, so the total would be 11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options: A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C)-3.80 kcal, D)-16.0 kJ.

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, but sometimes approximated as 4.18). Wait, no, wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 11.42 kcal would be 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. Hmm, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the units here.

Wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but the problem's options have some in kcal and some in kJ. So perhaps the answer is in kJ, but let me see.

Wait, let me calculate the total H+ neutralized as 0.2 moles. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not exactly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take into account that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ is strong. So in this case, H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 moles of H+ (since it's diprotic, but only the first is available for neutralization). So then total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles. So H+ is the limiting reagent, 0.19 moles neutralized, and 0.01 moles of OH- left. Wait, but that would make the total H+ neutralized 0.19, so enthalpy is 0.19 * (-57) = -10.83 kJ, which is about -11 kJ. But the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.3 kJ, which doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using calories instead of kilojoules. Wait, standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57,000 calories per mole (since 1 kJ is about 239 calories, so 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is about 13,400 calories. Wait, no, no: 1 kcal is 1000 calories, and 1 kJ is about 239 calories, so 57 kJ is about 13,400 calories, which is 13.4 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 13.4 = 2.68 kcal. That's close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But that would be if each mole of H+ is -13.4 kcal. Wait, but that doesn't fit because 57 kJ is about 13.4 kcal (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, so 57 kJ is 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.62 kcal). So each mole of H+ contributes about -13.62 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-13.62) ≈ -2.724 kcal. That's really close to option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, earlier I thought that the H+ neutralized would be 0.2 moles. But if I'm considering that H2SO4 only contributes one H+ per mole, then the total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19 moles. So 0.19 * 13.62 ≈ 2.588 kcal, which is about -2.59 kcal, but that's not one of the options. The options are A is -2.72, which would fit 0.2 moles.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that all H+ from H2SO4 are available. So going back, total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

That would give 0.2 *57,000 cal/mol (if 57 kJ is 57,000 J, but wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is 57,000 / 4.184 ≈ 13,620 calories, or 13.62 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.62 ≈ 2.724 kcal, which is option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but that would mean that the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal. So the answer would be A.

But wait, looking at the options, B is -11.42 kcal. Which would be if the calculation was done in kJ but assumed 57 kJ per mole.

Wait, 0.2 moles *57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of H+ and OH- from all the solutions and calculating the heat released.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles. Each gives 1 H+, so 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles.

Total H+ available: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- available: 0.2.

So neutralization: 0.2 moles H+ reacts with 0.2 moles OH- to form 0.2 moles H2O. The remaining H+ is 0.08.

So the amount of acid (H+) neutralized is 0.2 moles.

Each mole releases about 57 kJ (or 13.62 kcal) of energy. So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ, which is 11,400 J. Converting to kcal: 11,400 J /4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.726 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.726 kcal, which matches option A.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal. That would be about 48 kJ, which is 0.2 * 240 kJ/mol. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kJ but option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe it's using -57 kcal/mol, but that seems unlikely because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal, not 57.

Wait, maybe the standard enthalpy is -57,000 cal/mol, which is equivalent to -57 kJ/mol. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57,000 cal) = -11,400 cal, which is -11.4 kcal. So that's option B.

Wait, but wait, earlier calculation when using 57 kJ per mole gave 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ. But if 57 kJ is 57,000 J, which is 57,000 / 1000 = 57 kJ. So converting to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 ≈ 13.62 kcal.

So if the problem expects the answer in kcal, using 57,000 cal per mole → 57 kcal is 57,000 cal. Wait, no, 57,000 cal is 57 kcal (since 1 kcal = 1000 cal). So 57,000 cal = 57 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kcal. So the enthalpy is -11.4 kcal, which would be option B.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous approach where I thought the answer was about 2.72 kcal. So now I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy is given as -57 kcal/mol. But that would be way too high because 57 kcal is 238 kJ. Which is way higher than the standard value. So I'm probably mixing up the units.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole. That translates to about -13.6 kcal per mole because 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). So 57 kJ = 57 * 0.239 ≈13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, 0.2 *13.6 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That's about 48.8 kJ (because 11.42 kcal * 4.184 ≈47.6 kJ). So 0.2 moles would require 0.2*57=11.4 kJ, which is 11.4/4.184≈ 2.72 kcal. So that's why option A is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let's think again.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacted. So for n moles, ΔH = n * (-57 kJ).

In this problem, n is 0.2 moles. So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ. But none of the options is -11.4 kJ. The options are A to D. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 *4.184 ≈48 kJ. That's way too big. Wait, no, wait: 11.42 kcal is 11,420 cal. 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 11,420 cal is 47,660 J, which is 47.66 kJ. So option B is 47.66 kJ. But our calculation was 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So the discrepancy arises from whether the moles are 0.2 or something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H+.

Let me recalculate.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. But since it's diprotic, does each mole give 2 H+? So 0.09 *2=0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L=0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So H+ is in excess. Neutralization uses 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ.

But options have D as -16.0 kJ and B as -11.42 kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the H+.

Wait, perhaps the problem takes into account that H2SO4's second H+ is available. So each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+. So in that case, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 moles, and HCl is 0.1, total 0.28. OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized.

But then, if the enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ, the total would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the units. Let me reread the question. The options are in kcal and kJ. So perhaps the answer is in kJ, but 11.4 kJ is not an option. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B)-11.42 kcal, D)-16.0 kJ.

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Which would be 11.42 kcal = 11,420 cal = 47,664 J = 47.664 kJ. Which doesn't match 11.4 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molarity and volume in terms of the equivalents.

Wait, another approach: the equivalent method.

For HCl (monoprotic): equivalents = molarity * volume * 1 = 0.2 * 0.5 *1 = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4 (diprotic): equivalents = 0.3 * 0.3 *2 = 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2 (diprotic): equivalents = 0.5 *0.2 *2 =0.2 eq.

So total H+ equivalents: 0.1 +0.18=0.28.

OH- equivalents:0.2.

So neutralization uses 0.2 equivalents. Each equivalent releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ, which is approximately option B if it's in kcal. But 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (because 11,400 J /4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal). So that would match option A.

But why is option B present as -11.42 kcal? Because if the problem uses 57 kcal per mole, which is incorrect, perhaps. Because 57 kcal is way too big. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → ~-2.72 *4.184 ≈-11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → ~-48 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

So according to our calculation, the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which would correspond to option A: -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal). So option A would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kJ, but none of the options D is -11.4 kJ, but it's option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: I might have made a mistake in the calculation of equivalents. Let me recalculate.

HCl: 0.2 M *0.5 L =0.1 moles → 0.1 equivalents (since 1 H+ per mole).

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 moles → 0.18 equivalents (since 2 H+ per mole).

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 moles → 0.2 equivalents (since 2 OH- per mole).

Total H+ equivalents:0.1 +0.18=0.28.

Total OH- equivalents:0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 equivalents, using 0.2 *57 kJ=11.4 kJ.

But if the problem uses the enthalpy as 57 kcal per mole, which is wrong but let's see:

0.2 *57 kcal = 11.4 kcal → which is option B. So if the problem uses kcal instead of kJ, the answer would be B.

But standard enthalpy of neutralization is given in kJ, so it's more likely that option A is correct, being around 2.72 kcal (which is 11.4 kJ).

But the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the moles are more than 0.2. Let me recalculate the moles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is looking for the total heat released regardless of which is in excess. Let me think.

But no, because the neutralization depends on which reagent is limiting.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reaction between all the H+ and OH-, regardless of which is in excess. But that's not how neutralization works. The limiting reagent determines how much reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all H+ from both acids and all OH- from the base, but that's not the case because H+ is in excess. So the neutralization would stop when OH- is all used up.

So I think the correct approach is that 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 11.4 kJ (if using 57 kJ/mol) or 2.72 kcal (if converting to kcal). So the answer would be option A or B, depending on the units.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is very close to 11.4 kJ converted to kcal. But 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the neutralization is not only for H+ from HCl and H2SO4 but also for any other reactions. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it completely dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the second H+ doesn't react because OH- is already consumed. So the first H+ from H2SO4 fully reacts, but the second doesn't. So H2SO4 contributes 0.09 moles of H+ for neutralization. So total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 +0.09 =0.19 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles, so all H+ is used up, leaving 0.01 moles of OH-.

So neutralization is 0.19 moles, so enthalpy is 0.19 *57 kJ= 10.83 kJ → about 2.58 kcal.

But none of the options match exactly. Option C is -3.80 kcal, which is about 16.3 kJ. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 contributes two OH- per mole, but the H+ from H2SO4 can only donate one. So perhaps the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) and 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but earlier calculations led me to 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the neutralization involves all H+ and OH- regardless of which is in excess, but that's incorrect. So I think my initial approach is correct: 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 11.4 kJ or 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer should be option A) -2.72 kcal.

But why is option B present? Perhaps it's a mistake in the problem's setup. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for neutralization as the total moles of H+ and OH- and not considering which is limiting. Let's see:

Total H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2.

But the neutralization can't go beyond the limiting reagent. So only 0.2 H+ reacts.

So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ → 2.72 kcal.

So answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the total moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) ions available:

1. **Moles of \( \text{H}^+ \):**
   - From HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - From \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \): \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \). Since \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \) is diprotic, it contributes \( 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of } \text{H}^+ \).
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Moles of \( \text{OH}^- \):**
   - From \( \text{Ba(OH)}_2 \): \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \). Since \( \text{Ba(OH)}_2 \) dissociates into 2 \( \text{OH}^- \) ions, it contributes \( 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Neutralization Reaction:**
   - The limiting reagent is \( \text{OH}^- \), which has 0.2 moles. Thus, 0.2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) will react to form water:
     \[
     \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
   - The remaining \( \text{H}^+ \) after neutralization is \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

4. **Enthalpy of Neutralization:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).
   - For 0.2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) neutralized:
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
     Converting to kilocalories:
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Matching the Options:**
   - Option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)) matches the calculated value.
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) corresponds to \( -47.6 \, \text{kJ} \), which is inconsistent with the calculation.
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) is also inconsistent.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the enthalpy of neutralization in kilocalories, which is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

**Answer: A**
