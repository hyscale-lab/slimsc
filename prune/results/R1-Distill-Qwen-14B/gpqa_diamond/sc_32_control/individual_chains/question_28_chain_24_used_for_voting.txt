Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and think about each reaction carefully.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. I remember that this compound has a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group at position 4. The configuration is S, which I should probably confirm when I draw the structure.

First step: it's treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine. I think TBS-Cl is a silylating agent, commonly used as a protecting group for alcohols. Triethylamine is a base, so it likely deprotonates the hydroxyl group, making it a better nucleophile to attack the silyl chloride. So, the -OH group in the starting material would react with TBS-Cl to form a silyl ether. The product 1 would be the silyl protected version of the starting compound.

So, in product 1, the hydroxy group (OH) at position 4 would be replaced by a TBS group (OTBS). That makes sense. TBS is a good protecting group because it's bulky and can help prevent certain reactions from happening at that position.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide. I'm trying to remember what Ph2CuLi does. Oh right, Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent. It's used in conjugate additions, especially to ketones. So, when a ketone is present, the Gilman reagent can add to the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) system in a conjugate addition.

The starting material has a cyclohexenone ring, which is an enone. The enone system is at positions 1,2,3 on the ring (since the ketone is at 1, and the double bond is 2-en). So, the Gilman reagent would add to this system.

Wait, the silyl-protected compound has a cyclohexenone ring. The Gilman reagent would perform a 1,4-addition here. The cyclohexenone is a conjugated dienone? Or just an enone? Let me think. In this case, it's a cyclohex-2-en-1-one, so the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. So, the enone is C1-C2-C3, with the double bond between 2 and 3. So, when Ph2CuLi adds, it will add the organocopper nucleophile to the beta position, which is C3.

Wait, or is it the alpha position? I think the Gilman reagent adds to the alpha position. Let me think: the ketone is at C1, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the alpha carbons are C2 and C3. The addition would be to the beta position, which is C3, since the enone is C1=C2-C(=O)-R? Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the enone is C1=C-O (wait, no, the structure is cyclohex-2-en-1-one, so the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. So the structure is a six-membered ring with the ketone at position 1, double bond between 2 and 3, making the ring have a conjugated dienone system?

Wait, the starting molecule is 4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So, positions 1 is the ketone, 4 is the hydroxyl, and the double bond is between 2 and 3. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is a carbonyl, C2 and C3 are double-bonded, and C4 has a hydroxyl group.

So, when Ph2CuLi is added, the Gilman reagent will add to the alpha and beta positions. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the regiochemistry here. The enone is at 1,2,3, so the conjugate addition would add the organocopper (from Ph2CuLi) to the beta carbon (C3) and the copper would attach to the alpha carbon (C2), I think.

Wait, no, the Gilman reagent typically does a 1,4 addition. So, the nucleophilic part (the aryl group from Ph2CuLi) would add to the beta carbon (C3), and the conjugate base would form on the alpha carbon (C2). Then, when the quench happens (with benzyl bromide), the benzyl group would add to the alpha position (C2).

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let's think about the mechanism: the Gilman reagent (Ph2CuLi) would attack the beta position (C3) because of conjugate addition. Then, the copper is attached to the alpha position (C2), and then when the benzyl bromide is added (which is an alkylating agent), it would transfer the benzyl group to the alpha carbon.

Wait, perhaps the process is that the Gilman reagent adds to the enone, forming a new bond at the beta position. Then, when you add benzyl bromide, it provides an R-X (R is benzyl) which would substitute the copper at the alpha position. So, product 2 would have a benzyl group added to the alpha position (C2) and a phenyl group from the Gilman reagent at the beta position (C3).

Wait, the Gilman reagent is Ph2CuLi. When it adds to the enone, the organocopper (Ph2Cu-) attacks the beta carbon (C3). Then, the alpha carbon (C2) would have the copper attached. Then, when the benzyl bromide is added, it would transfer the benzyl group to the alpha position via an SN2 mechanism, because the copper is a good leaving group? Or maybe it's an oxidative addition?

Wait, perhaps the steps are: the Gilman reagent adds to the enone, giving a cyclohexane ring with a new substituent at C3 (Ph2Cu attached), and the C2 has a negative charge (or a conjugate base). Then, when benzyl bromide is added, the benzyl group would attack the alpha carbon (C2), where the base from the previous step is, leading to the formation of a new bond there.

Alternatively, perhaps after the addition of the Gilman reagent, the benzyl bromide acts as an electrophilic source, providing the benzyl group to substitute the copper.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should think about a similar reaction I've seen. For example, when a Gilman reagent adds to an enone, it does a conjugate addition, adding the organocopper to the beta position. Then, upon addition of an alkyl halide (like benzyl bromide), the benzyl group is added to the alpha position. So, in this case, the product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group (from the Gilman reagent) at C3.

Wait, no, the Gilman reagent is Ph2CuLi. So, when it adds to the enone (1,2,3 positions), the organocopper part (Ph2Cu-) would add to the beta carbon (C3). Then, when the benzyl bromide is added, the benzyl group (R = benzyl) would add to the alpha carbon (C2). So after this step, product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and perhaps the Ph groups from the Gilman reagent attached elsewhere.

Wait, but the starting material is a cyclohexenone. Let me imagine the structure. So, the cyclohexenone is a six-membered ring with:

- C1: ketone (O)
- C2: double bond to C3 (so C2 and C3 are double bonded)
- C4: hydroxyl group (which is silyl-protected in product 1)
- So, the positions are 1 (carbonyl), 2 (CH2?), no, wait. Wait, cyclohex-2-en-1-one would have the double bond between C2 and C3, and the ketone at C1. So, the ring is:

1: carbonyl (O)
2: double bond to C3
3: double bond to C2
4: OH (protected as OTBS)
5: CH2
6: CH2?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally as a chair. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are arranged as 1 (carbonyl), 2 and 3 (double bond), 4 (OH), and the rest are CH2 groups.

So, when the Gilman reagent adds, it would add to the double bond in a conjugate fashion. The organocopper (Ph2Cu-) would add to the beta position (C3), and the alpha position (C2) gets a negative charge, which is then quenched by the benzyl bromide (which is an alkylating agent) to add a benzyl group to C2.

Wait, but benzyl bromide is an alkyl halide; perhaps the benzyl group will substitute the copper at C2. So, after the addition of Ph2CuLi, the benzyl bromide would provide a benzyl group to C2.

So, product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and the Ph groups from the Gilman reagent at C3?

Wait, no. Wait, the Ph2CuLi is a source of Ph2Cu- which adds to the enone. So, the product after the addition would have a new substituent at C3 (Ph2Cu- adding there) and a negative charge at C2. Then, adding benzyl bromide (which is a good electrophile) would cause that benzyl to attack the alpha carbon (C2), perhaps via an SN2 mechanism, leading to substitution of the copper group.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the general reaction: when a Gilman reagent adds to an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, it performs a 1,4-addition. The organocopper adds to the beta carbon (C3), and the alpha carbon (C2) gets a nucleophilic species (like a carbanion). Then, when you add an alkylating agent (like benzyl bromide), it will donate the benzyl group to the alpha position.

So, product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and perhaps a phenyl group at C3, but wait, the Gilman reagent has two phenyl groups. Wait, no, the reagent is Ph2CuLi. When it adds, the Ph2Cu- would add as a single unit to the beta carbon (C3), and then, when the benzyl bromide is added, it would add a benzyl group to the alpha carbon (C2).

Wait, but after the addition of Ph2CuLi, we have the benzyl bromide added next. So, product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and the Ph2Cu group attached elsewhere? Or would the benzyl replace the copper?

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism again. The initial addition of Ph2CuLi to the enone gives an organocopper intermediate. Then, the benzyl bromide is added, which would alkylate the alpha position. So, perhaps the benzyl group comes from benzyl bromide and adds to C2, while the Ph groups from the Gilman reagent add to C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl group is added to the position where the copper was. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's best to think that product 2 has a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group at C3.

Wait, but the starting material has a cyclohexenone. After the addition, the ring is saturated? Because the double bond would have been involved in the addition. So, product 2 would have a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group (from the Gilman reagent) at C3, and the OTBS group at C4.

Wait, but wait—does the addition of the Gilman reagent add to the ring or form a new substituent? Let me think: the starting material is a cyclic enone, so the addition would open the ring?

No, wait. The enone is part of a six-membered ring. The addition would add groups across the double bond, leading to a bicyclic structure? Or perhaps just add substituents without breaking the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of the Gilman reagent to the enone leads to a new substituent on the ring, adding across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the structure after each step. Let's go through each step in detail.

Step 1: Protecting the hydroxyl group with TBS-Cl.

Starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one.

After step 1 (product 1), the OH at C4 is now OTBS.

Step 2: Treat with Ph2CuLi, then benzyl bromide.

So, the enone is at C1-C2-C3. Ph2CuLi will add to the beta position, which is C3. Then benzyl bromide adds to the alpha position, which is C2.

Wait, but wait. The alpha and beta positions are relative to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is at C1. So, the alpha carbons are C2 and C3 (since they are adjacent to the carbonyl). So, in the enone system, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the alpha carbons are C2 and C3. The beta carbons are C4 and C5? Wait, no. Wait, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the positions are numbered such that the carbonyl is at position 1, the alpha carbons are 2, and beta are 3.

Wait, no. For an enone like cyclohex-2-en-1-one, the positions are 1 (carbonyl), 2 and 3 (double bond), so the alpha positions are 2. The beta position is 3.

Wait, perhaps the alpha is the position adjacent to the carbonyl (C2), and the beta is the next (C3).

So, when Ph2CuLi adds to the enone, the organocopper adds to the beta position (C3). So, the Ph2Cu group attaches to C3, and the alpha position (C2) becomes deprotonated or has a negative charge.

But in the presence of benzyl bromide, which is an alkylating agent, the benzyl group (R = benzyl) will attack the alpha position (C2), which is where the negative charge is.

So, product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and the Ph groups from the Gilman reagent at C3.

Wait, but the Gilman reagent is Ph2CuLi, so the organocopper is Ph2Cu-. So, when it adds to C3, that would bring in two phenyl groups attached to C3, right? Because the organocopper has two phenyl groups attached to the copper. So, when it adds to C3, those two phenyl groups would be attached to C3?

Wait, no. The organocopper is Ph2CuLi, which is a lithium salt. The reactive part is the Ph2Cu- which is a strong nucleophile. So, when it adds to the enone, the Ph2Cu- will attack the beta carbon (C3), and the alpha carbon (C2) will have a lone pair.

But wait, when the organocopper adds, it brings its substituents with it. So, the Ph2Cu- adds to C3, so C3 would have two phenyl groups attached? Because the Cu is connected to two phenyl groups. Wait, but no—Ph2Cu- is a single group, with two phenyl substituents on the copper. When the copper adds to the carbon, the substituents (phenyl groups) would be attached to the same carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The structure of Ph2CuLi is [Ph2Cu]Li. So, the copper is connected to two phenyl groups and a lithium. When it reacts with the enone, the Ph2Cu- attacks the beta carbon (C3), so the copper attaches to C3, bringing the two phenyl groups with it. So, C3 would have two phenyl groups attached after the addition. Then, during workup, the copper would be replaced, perhaps?

Wait, no, after the addition, the structure would have a new substituent at C3. Then, when the benzyl bromide is added, it would add a benzyl group to the alpha position (C2), which is deprotonated.

So, after step 2, product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group (from the Gilman reagent) at C3. Wait, but the Gilman reagent brings two phenyl groups, so would C3 have two phenyl groups?

Wait, no. I think that the organocopper (Ph2Cu-) adds to C3, meaning that the C3 now has a substituent which is the Ph2Cu group. Then, during the workup with benzyl bromide, perhaps the benzyl group replaces the copper.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the actual mechanism. The addition of the organocopper to the enone forms a betaine intermediate. The betaine has the organocopper attached to the beta carbon and a negatively charged alpha carbon. Then, when an alkylating agent (like benzyl bromide) is added, it would attack the alpha carbon, leading to the substitution of the copper group with the benzyl group.

So, in this case, the benzyl group would add to the alpha carbon (C2), and the organocopper (from Ph2CuLi) would be displaced. But wait, the organocopper has two phenyl groups attached to copper. So, perhaps the Cu would leave, taking the two phenyl groups with it. But that doesn't make sense because we can't have two phenyl groups leaving as a single group.

Ah, perhaps the addition forms a new carbon–copper bond at C3, and the alpha carbon (C2) becomes a carbanion. Then, when the benzyl bromide is added, the benzyl group (which is a good electrophile) would attack C2, leading to the substitution of the copper group.

But wait, how does that substitution happen? The carbanion at C2 would attack the benzyl bromide (which is an SN2 reaction?), leading to the benzyl group attaching to C2. The copper would then be released as Ph2CuBr, perhaps.

So, in product 2, the benzyl group is at C2, and the phenyl groups are not added as substituents but perhaps stay as part of the copper complex. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that part.

Alternatively, perhaps the Gilman reagent adds a phenyl group to C3, and the benzyl group is added to C2. But wait, the reagent is Ph2CuLi, so when it adds, the phenyl groups would be attached to the carbon where the copper was. So, C3 would have two phenyl groups attached.

Wait, but that's not possible because a carbon can't have two phenyl groups without being a substituent. Unless it's a bicyclic structure, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent adds a single phenyl group, but that doesn't make sense because the reagent has two phenyl groups attached to the copper.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look for similar reactions or mechanisms in my notes. Oh right, when a Gilman reagent adds to an enone, the organometallic adds to the beta carbon, and the alpha carbon becomes a nucleophile. Then, when an alkyl halide is added, the alkyl group adds to the alpha carbon.

In this case, the organocopper (Ph2CuLi) adds to C3 (beta), making C2 a nucleophile. Then, benzyl bromide (which is an alkyl halide) adds a benzyl group to C2.

So, product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group at C3 (from the Gilman reagent). Wait, but the organocopper has two phenyl groups attached. So, perhaps each addition brings a phenyl group to C3. But that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, perhaps the addition brings a single phenyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each molecule of Ph2CuLi adds two phenyl groups to the same carbon. But that would require a very substituted structure, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't add any phenyl groups but just the benzyl group from the benzyl bromide. But the question says that product 2 is formed after adding both the Gilman reagent and benzyl bromide.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product after step 2. Product 2 has a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group at C3, but I'm not certain.

Moving on to step 3: treating product 2 with LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) and iodomethane at low temperature. LDA is a strong base, typically used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates. Iodomethane is a methylating agent.

In this step, LDA would deprotonate a suitable proton, probably alpha to the ketone, to form an enolate. Then, iodomethane (CH3I) would methylate the enolate, adding a methyl group to the alpha position.

So, which position would be deprotonated? The ketone is at C1. The alpha positions are C2 and C3. But product 2 has a benzyl group at C2 and perhaps a phenyl group at C3. So, the alpha positions are C2 and C3.

If LDA deprotonates the alpha position, say C2, but C2 already has a benzyl group. Would that position be more acidic? Alternatively, if C3 has a phenyl group, perhaps that makes it less acidic, so LDA might deprotonate a different position.

Wait, but after step 2, the structure would have a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group at C3. The ketone is at C1. So, when LDA is added, it would deprotonate an alpha hydrogen adjacent to the ketone. The possible positions are C2 and C3. But C2 has a benzyl group, which is bulky. So, perhaps the LDA would deprotonate the more acidic hydrogen, which might be at C3.

Wait, but C3 has a phenyl group from the Gilman reagent. So, perhaps the acidity of the protons at C3 is affected by the substituents. Phenyl groups are electron-withdrawing, which can increase acidity. So, the hydrogen at C3 might be more acidic and be deprotonated by LDA.

Once deprotonated, the enolate would form, and then iodomethane would methylate it. So, the methyl group would add to the alpha carbon, which is C3 in this case.

Wait, but product 2 has a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group at C3. So, adding a methyl group at C3 would give a methyl substituent there. Thus, product 3 would have a benzyl at C2, a phenyl at C3, and a methyl at C3? Wait, that can't be right because C3 can't have three substituents (unless it's a quaternary center, which is possible).

Wait, the structure after step 2 is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, a benzyl group at C2, and a phenyl group at C3, and the OTBS group at C4.

Then, when LDA is added, it deprotonates the alpha position. The alpha positions are C2 and C3. C2 has a benzyl group, but perhaps the hydrogen at C3 is more acidic because of the phenyl group. Deprotonation at C3 would form an enolate, which would attack the iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C3.

So, product 3 would have a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, and a methyl group at C3. But wait, that's three substituents on C3, which is possible. Alternatively, perhaps the LDA deprotonates a different position, but I'll go with this for now.

Finally, step 4: treating product 3 with aqueous HCl. This is likely an acid workup, which would protonate any enolates and also hydrolyze any protecting groups. The TBS group at C4 would be removed under acidic conditions, giving back a hydroxyl group.

So, the final product 4 would have:

- A ketone at C1 (since the TBS group was at C4, and the ketone wasn't affected)
- A benzyl group at C2
- A methyl group and a phenyl group at C3
- A hydroxyl group at C4 (after deprotection)
- The rest of the ring would be CH2 groups.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a phenyl group at C3. Let me check the options again.

Option A: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

Hmm, that's a cyclohexanone with a benzyl at C2, phenyl at C3, methyl at C6, and hydroxy at C4.

Wait, but in my earlier steps, I thought the methyl was added at C3. But according to this option, the methyl is at C6. So, perhaps my earlier analysis is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is added elsewhere.

Wait, let me reevaluate the step 3. Maybe I made a mistake in the deprotonation site.

After step 2, the structure is:

C1: ketone
C2: benzyl group
C3: phenyl group (from the Gilman reagent)
C4: OTBS group

When LDA is added, it deprotonates an alpha position. The alpha positions are C2 and C3. C2 has a benzyl group, which is bulky, but perhaps the hydrogen at C3 is more acidic due to the phenyl group. So, LDA deprotonates C3 to form an enolate.

Then, iodomethane would methylate at C3. So, C3 would have a methyl group added. But looking at the options, only option A has a phenyl group at C3, but with a methyl at C6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Maybe the methyl is added to C6 instead of C3. How could that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps during the LDA treatment, the enolate forms at a different position. Let me think again about the structure of product 2.

Product 2 after step 2 is a cyclohexane ring with:

- C1: ketone
- C2: benzyl group
- C3: phenyl group (from the organocopper addition)
- C4: OTBS group
- C5 and C6: CH2 groups.

So, when LDA is added, it would deprotonate the alpha position adjacent to the ketone. The alpha positions are C2 and C3. C2 has a benzyl group, making it more substituted and perhaps less acidic. C3 has a phenyl group, which is electron-withdrawing, making the hydrogen more acidic. So, LDA would deprotonate C3.

Then, iodomethane would add a methyl group to C3, making it have a methyl substituent. But the options don't show a methyl at C3 except for option A, which has a phenyl at C3 and a methyl at C6. So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect here.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is added to a different position. Maybe the enolate forms at C6 instead of C3. How?

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully. The cyclohexane ring has substituents at C1 (ketone), C2 (benzyl), C3 (phenyl), and C4 (OTBS). The other positions (C5 and C6) are CH2 groups.

When LDA is added, it deprotonates the most acidic alpha hydrogen. The alpha positions are C2 and C3. But wait, maybe the ring has other alpha positions. For a cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl, which are C2 and C6 (if the ring is numbered appropriately). Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong earlier.

Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So, C2 is adjacent to C1 (on one side), and C6 is adjacent on the other side. So, the alpha positions are C2 and C6.

Wait, this changes everything. So, in product 2, after step 2, the structure has:

- C1: ketone
- C2: benzyl group
- C3: phenyl group (from the reagent)
- C4: OTBS group.

The alpha positions are C2 and C6 (adjacent to C1). So, when LDA is added, it would deprotonate either C2 or C6, whichever is more acidic.

C2 has a benzyl group, which makes it more substituted and maybe less acidic. C6 is a CH2 group, which might have a more acidic hydrogen because it's less substituted. Alternatively, if C6 is deprotonated, the enolate would form at C6, and iodomethane would add a methyl group there.

So, product 3 would have a methyl group at C6, and then when the TBS group is removed in step 4, the hydroxyl group would be at C4.

Looking at the options, option A has a methyl at C6, a benzyl at C2, and a phenyl at C3. That fits this scenario.

So, putting it all together:

- Step 1: Protects the hydroxyl at C4 as OTBS.
- Step 2: Adds a benzyl group at C2 and a phenyl group at C3 (from the reagents).
- Step 3: LDA deprotonates C6 (alpha to ketone), forms enolate, which is methylated by iodomethane, adding a methyl at C6.
- Step 4: Hydrolyzes the OTBS group to give OH at C4.

Thus, the final product would have a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, a methyl at C6, and a hydroxyl at C4, all in a cyclohexanone ring.

Looking at the options, option A is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one. That fits the structure we're thinking of.

Wait, but let me think about the stereochemistry. The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. When the TBS group is added, the configuration at C4 remains S.

After step 2, adding substituents at C2 and C3 would influence the configuration. Then, the methyl addition at C6 would also affect the stereochemistry.

But given the options, option A includes all the substituents we've discussed. So, I think option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step organic synthesis starting with (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Here's the analysis of each step and the final product:

1. **Step 1**: Treatment with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine protects the hydroxyl group at position 4 as a silyl ether (OTBS). The product (product 1) retains the ketone at C1, the double bond between C2 and C3, and the OTBS group at C4.

2. **Step 2**: Reaction with Ph₂CuLi (a Gilman reagent) followed by benzyl bromide performs a conjugate addition to the enone system. The Ph₂Cu- group adds to the beta carbon (C3), and the benzyl group (from benzyl bromide) adds to the alpha carbon (C2). The product (product 2) now has a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, and the OTBS group at C4.

3. **Step 3**: Treatment with LDA (a strong base) deprotonates an alpha hydrogen adjacent to the ketone. The more acidic hydrogen at C6 (due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the ketone) is deprotonated, forming an enolate. Iodomethane then methylates the enolate, adding a methyl group at C6. The product (product 3) now has a methyl group at C6 in addition to the benzyl group at C2, the phenyl group at C3, and the OTBS group at C4.

4. **Step 4**: Treatment with aqueous HCl hydrolyzes the TBS group at C4, regenerating the hydroxyl group. The final product (product 4) is a cyclohexanone with a ketone at C1, a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, a methyl group at C6, and a hydroxyl group at C4.

The structure of the final product matches **Option A**: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

Answer: A
