Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's like a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? Yeah, I think that's correct.

So the reaction is with sodium amide (NaNH2) in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, I think it's involved in things like elimination or maybe some kind of substitution.

Wait, benzene rings with substituents can undergo various reactions. Since the molecule has bromine and deuterium, maybe it's about some kind of elimination or substitution, but considering the positions.

Wait, wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So, the structure is like Br is in the para position relative to the deuterium? Wait, no. Let me imagine the numbering. Let's say position 1 is the top of the benzene ring. Then position 2 is adjacent, so that's the ortho position. So Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? NaNH2 in ammonia is typically used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Oh wait, but benzene doesn't really eliminate like aliphatic compounds. Maybe it's a ring substitution.

Wait a second, perhaps this is a case where elimination occurs to form a triple bond or something else. Wait, but benzene's structure is pretty stable. Another possibility is that the bromide is a leaving group. But wait, benzene rings with substituents can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution under certain conditions. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's a deprotonation followed by elimination.

Wait, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If the D is deuterium, maybe it's a hydrogen on the ring. Wait, no, wait. In benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen unless substituted. So in this case, position 1 has Br, position 2 has D, and the other positions (3,4,5,6) have H.

Wait, but if that's the case, the structure is monosubstituted with Br and D at ortho positions. So, when we treat with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination.

Wait, but in benzene rings, elimination typically would form a double bond, but the ring is already aromatic. Hmm, maybe it's about forming a benzynes intermediate. Oh right! Benzynes are formed through elimination of HX from 1,2-diX benzene rings. So, if you have two substituents on adjacent carbons, like Br and something else, eliminating them can form a triple bond (a diradical intermediate, but that's more complicated). Wait, but in this case, we have Br and D. So, maybe the D is in the ortho position to Br.

Wait, but D is a deuterium, which is a hydrogen isotope. So, maybe the reaction is similar to normal H.

Wait, I think benzynes are formed when two adjacent substituents (like Br and another leaving group) are present. Then, elimination of HBr or similar occurs, forming a triple bond. But in our case, we have bromine and deuterium. So, would that lead to elimination of DBr?

Wait, but deuterium is less acidic than hydrogen. Hmm, the pKa of D in such a position would be higher than H, so maybe it's harder to abstract. But NaNH2 is a strong base. Let me think.

So, if we have 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So, the base NaNH2 could deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the Br. Wait, but in position 2, it's a D, not a H. So, can the base abstract a D from position 2?

Wait, but deuterium's acidity is weaker than protium. So, perhaps the base is not strong enough to abstract D. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br and adjacent to D.

Wait, so let's think about the structure. Position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, position 3 is H. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. The base could abstract a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (which has D). Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2, but position 1 is Br. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, then we have a negative charge on position 3. Then, perhaps the Br could leave, leading to a carbanion, which then could form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, creating a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, that's possible. So, the Br is at position 1, and when the H is abstracted from position 3, we lose Br- and form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, creating benzyne.

But wait, does that lead to any rearrangement? Or would the benzyne be a diradical that can combine with another molecule?

Hmm, but the reaction conditions are important here. The solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent, and NaNH2 is a strong base. So, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond, but in aromatic rings, that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination and formation of a triple bond.

Wait, but in order to eliminate, the base needs to abstract a proton that's beta to the Br. So, in this case, the Br is at 1, so the beta protons would be at positions 3 and 4. Because if I imagine the Br at position 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. The beta positions would be the ones adjacent to those, so positions 3 and 4 (if 2 is adjacent, then 3 is next to 2, which is adjacent to 1), and position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so position 5 is adjacent to 6.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1. So, positions 2,3,4,5,6 are around. The positions adjacent to Br are 2 and 6. The positions adjacent to those would be 3 and 5 (for position 2 and 6 respectively). So, the beta protons would be at positions 3 and 5.

So, the base NaNH2 could abstract a proton from position 3 or position 5. Then, elimination of HBr would occur, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, elimination would form a triple bond between the two adjacent carbons where the leaving groups (H and Br) were removed. So, if I abstract a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (which has D), perhaps the Br is at position 1 and the D is at position 2. So, if position 3 is abstracted, then elimination would be between position 1 and position 2, but wait, position 2 has D not H. Wait, but the base abstracts a H from position 3, and the Br leaves from position 1. So, that would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but position 2 has a D.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. The base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2. Then, Br leaves from position 1, and the H from position 3 is abstracted, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 2.

But wait, position 2 has D, not H. So, if the base abstracts a H from position 3, the adjacent position is 2, which has D. Hmm, but the D is on the same ring. So, perhaps when the H is abstracted, the Br leaves, and the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, but position 2 has D. But I'm not sure if that would affect the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the elimination process much. So, if the base abstracts H from position 3, then elimination of Br from 1 and H from 3 forms a triple bond between 1 and 2, leading to a benzyne intermediate. Similarly, if the base abstracts H from position 5 (which is also adjacent to position 6, which is adjacent to position 1?), the same thing could happen, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1, which has Br. So, if the base abstracts H from position 5, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. So, in that case, we get two possible products, depending on which hydrogen is abstracted.

Wait, but position 3 and position 5 are symmetric with respect to the Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, abstracting H from position 3 and position 5 would lead to two different products because the triple bonds would be in different positions.

Wait, but the D is at position 2. So, when you eliminate between 1 and 2, you get a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But position 2 already has D, so would that affect the product? Or would the triple bond be between 1 and 2, regardless of the D?

Alternatively, maybe the D is a substituent that doesn't affect the elimination. So, the benzyne formed is either between 1 and 2 or between 1 and 6, depending on which H is abstracted.

Wait, but wait, position 2 is adjacent to position 1, so if the base abstracts H from position 3, then the triple bond would form between 1 and 2. If the base abstracts H from position 5, the triple bond forms between 1 and 6. But in the latter case, position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so that's possible.

Wait, but in the case of 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the positions available for H abstraction that are beta to Br would be positions 3 and 5. So, each abstraction would lead to a different benzyne structure.

So, if the base abstracts H from position 3, eliminating Br and H leads to a triple bond between 1 and 2. If it abstracts H from position 5, it leads to a triple bond between 1 and 6. So, two possible products.

But wait, I thought benzyne is symmetrical. No, because in this case, the substituents (D at position 2) would influence the structure. So, the benzyne formed when eliminating between 1 and 2 would have the D at position 2, while the one eliminating between 1 and 6 would have D at position 2 relative to that structure.

Wait, if we have a triple bond between 1 and 2, the ring would have the D at position 2, but the triple bond is between 1 and 2. So, that's one product. The other option is a triple bond between 1 and 6, so the D is at position 2 relative to that structure. But wait, if the triple bond is between 1 and 6, then position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (Br) and position 3. So, the D is at position 2 regardless.

Wait, but wait, when the triple bond is between 1 and 2, the substituents would be D on position 2 and the triple bond between 1 and 2. After elimination, would the D remain in the same position?

Alternatively, perhaps the D stays as a substituent, but the triple bond is elsewhere.

Wait, no, the D is on position 2, so when the triple bond forms between 1 and 2, the D is on position 2, which is part of the triple bond. Wait, that can't be, because the triple bond is between C1 and C2. So, in that case, the D would be on C2, which is part of the triple bond.

Hmm, but the triple bond is formed by eliminating H and Br. So, if the base abstracts H from C3, then Br leaves from C1, and the triple bond forms between C1 and C2. But C2 already has D. So, would that D be involved in the triple bond?

Wait, no, because the D is a substituent on C2, so the triple bond would be between C1 and C2, but C2 also has a D attached. So, that's possible. So, the product would be a benzyne (triple bond) between C1 and C2, with a D attached to C2.

Similarly, if the base abstracts H from C5, the triple bond would form between C1 and C6, and the D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1.

Wait, but in the second case, when the triple bond is between C1 and C6, the D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1, but not to the triple bond. So, that's a different structure.

Wait, but would the positions lead to different products? Or are they the same because of the ring's symmetry?

Hmm, in this molecule, the Br is at position 1, D is at 2. So, when the triple bond is between 1 and 2, the D is on the same carbon as the triple bond. When the triple bond is between 1 and 6, the D is on the adjacent carbon (position 2) relative to position 1. So, are these two structures different?

Wait, let's consider the structure: in the first case, triple bond is between 1 and 2, and D is on 2. In the second, triple bond is between 1 and 6, and D is on 2, which is adjacent to 1.

But wait, in benzene, the positions are relative. So, in the first case, the triple bond is between 1 and 2, making the ring have a triple bond in one position. In the second case, the triple bond is between 1 and 6, which is also adjacent. So, are these two products different? Because of the ring's symmetry, maybe. Let me think: the ring is symmetric with respect to the Br at position 1.

Wait, no. Because the D is fixed at position 2, which is ortho to Br. So, if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, that's one structure, and if between 1 and 6, that's another, because position 6 is not adjacent to D. Wait, no, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br), and position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps when the triple bond is between 1 and 6, the D is on position 2, which is adjacent to 1 but not to the triple bond. So, the two products are different because the substituents are in different positions relative to the triple bond.

So, that would mean two possible products. So, the correct answer would be 2 products, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the deuterium affects the reaction. Because deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen, perhaps the reaction rate is different, but in this case, the question is about the number of possible products, not the rate.

So, considering all this, the reaction would lead to two possible products, so the answer is C.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and such reactions typically involve deprotonation and elimination to form a benzyne intermediate.

In this case, the base NaNH₂ can abstract a proton from a position adjacent to the bromine (a β-hydrogen). The β-hydrogens are located at positions 3 and 5 of the benzene ring. Deprotonation at position 3 leads to elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, resulting in a benzyne intermediate with the deuterium at position 2. Similarly, deprotonation at position 5 leads to elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, resulting in a different benzyne intermediate.

The two possible products are structurally distinct because the deuterium at position 2 is positioned differently relative to the triple bond in each case. Therefore, the reaction produces two unique organic products.
