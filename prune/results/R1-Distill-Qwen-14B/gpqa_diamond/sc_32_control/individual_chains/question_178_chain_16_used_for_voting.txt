Okay, so I have this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ is defined as (i/2)[γμ, γν]. Right, the gamma matrices' commutator. F is the field strength tensor, which I think is antisymmetric. 

First, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important for renormalizability. A renormalizable theory has all terms with mass dimension ≤4. If any term has a higher dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable and requires some cutoff.

So, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should find the mass dimensions of each component in the term, then solve for [κ].

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. In four spacetime dimensions, fermions ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because, in QED, the Dirac field ψ has [ψ]_M = 3/2, because the Lagrangian term iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimension 4, so each ψ contributes 3/2, and the derivative is dimension 1. So yes, ψ is 3/2.

The field F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is derived from the vector potential A, which has dimension 1. The field strength is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative adds 1. So F has mass dimension 2, since A has dimension 1, and each derivative adds 1. So F is [2].

Now, what about σ_{μν}? It's a commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they are matrices, not fields. So [γμ]_M = 0. Since σ is made from commutators, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has mass dimension 0.

So let's break down each part of the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is 3/2, ψ̄ is the same. σ is 0, F is 2. So putting it together: each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is 3. Then multiplying by σ (0) doesn't change that. Then multiplying by F^{μν} (2) gives 3 + 2 = 5. So the entire term has mass dimension [κ] + 5. But the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because it's integrated over four dimensions, and the action is dimensionless. So the Lagrangian density must have [L]_M =4.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]_M = -1. So κ has dimension -1.

Now, for renormalizability. The theory's renormalizability depends on the possible divergences. Each term in the Lagrangian corresponds to a vertex in Feynman diagrams. The superficial degree of divergence can be calculated, and if it's non-positive, the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, another approach: the term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So any interaction term in the Lagrangian with mass dimension ≤4 is renormalizable. So the term here is of dimension 4 (since κ is -1, and the rest gave 5, so overall 4) because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, no, the entire term has dimension [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F}. So [ψ̄] is 3/2, same as ψ. σ is 0, F is 2. So [ψ̄] + [ψ] is 3. [F] is 2. So 3+2=5. Then [κ] is -1, so total is 4. So the term has dimension 4. Therefore, the interaction term is renormalizable because its dimension is 4.

Wait, but wait. How about the number of fields? Because each fermion field is dimension 3/2, but the vertex has four fermion legs and one boson leg (F). Hmm, but in terms of renormalizability, the term's dimension is the key. So if the term has dimension 4, it's renormalizable.

So the theory is renormalizable because the interaction term is of dimension 4. So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren.

D) [κ]=1, not ren.

So since [κ] is -1 and renormalizable, the correct option is A.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$ (derived from $A_\mu$, which has dimension $1$).
- The gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$ are dimensionless, so $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$, being a commutator of $\gamma_\mu$ and $\gamma_\nu$, also has mass dimension $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because the Lagrangian density has mass dimension $4$. Breaking down the dimensions:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

Adding these contributions:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]
Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension $\leq 4$. The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $4$, so the theory is renormalizable.

### Step 4: Final answer
From the options:
- A) $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable.
- B) $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable.
- C) $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable.
- D) $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable.

The correct choice is **A**, as $[\kappa]_M = -1$ and the theory is renormalizable.
