Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of stars. Right, the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx to the power of 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Wait, I think this has to do with the volume of space within a certain distance. Because the number of stars depends on the volume, which in turn depends on the distance cubed. Oh wait, but parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so distance is 1/plx. 

So, if I consider a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a change in distance. Wait, I should think about how the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to the surface area of that shell times the thickness. Surface area is 4πr², and thickness would be dr. So the number of stars N would be proportional to 4πr² dr.

But since parallax plx is 1/r, r is 1/plx. Substituting that in, we get N proportional to 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But wait, dr is the change in distance. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, but since we're talking about the magnitude, I can ignore the sign for now.

So substituting dr into the expression, N is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx²). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If r = 1/plx, then dr = - (dplx)/ (plx^2). So dr = - dplx/(plx^2). But when plx increases, r decreases, so the shell at higher plx (smaller r) has a smaller radius.

But when we talk about the number of stars per unit range of plx, we're looking at how N varies with plx for a given dplx. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) would be N/(dplx), which is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/(plx²)) ) * (1/(dplx)) )? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me start again. N is the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r. The volume of that shell is the surface area times thickness. So dN = density * 4πr² dr. Assuming uniform distribution, the density is constant. So dN ∝ r² dr.

But since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx. So substituting, dN ∝ (1/plx)^2 dr.

But dr is the change in distance. Since r=1/plx, dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. So dr = -dplx/(plx^2). The negative sign indicates direction, but for magnitude, we can take absolute values. So substituting dr in the equation:

dN ∝ (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) )

Which is dN ∝ dplx / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit plx range. So dN per dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait. The question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So if you have a range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range? So it's dN/dplx, which according to the above is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the variables. Let me think another way. If you have a certain volume between plx and plx + dplx, but plx is inversely proportional to distance. So higher plx means closer stars. So the volume per unit plx at a certain plx would be something.

Wait, another approach: the number density of stars is uniform, so the total number in a volume V is proportional to V. The volume between distance r and r + dr (where r=1/plx) is 4π(r² dr). So for a given dr (distance step), the volume is r² dr. But parallax plx is 1/r, so r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So substituting, the volume becomes (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2). So the volume is dV = (dplx / plx^4) * 4π. So the number of stars in that volume is proportional to dV, which is dN = k * (dplx / plx^4). So the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is k / plx^4.

So again, that points to option A.

Alternatively, if you think of the number per unit interval of plx, which is dN/dplx, which is proportional to 1/plx^4, that's option A.

So the answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( r \) is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is given by \( 4\pi r^2 \, dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, dr \).

The change in distance \( dr \) is related to the change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) by \( dr = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \). Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., \( \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \)) becomes proportional to:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), corresponding to option A.
