Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out.

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an O in the ester linkage. So that gives me a hint about the functional groups present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Two are aromatic protons, two are vinyl protons (so maybe from a double bond?), and two are CH3 groups. No signals for CH2 groups, which suggests there aren't any methylene groups in the molecule.

Let me think about what this structure could be. Since it's a di-substituted benzene and has an ester group, maybe one substituent is an ester. Wait, but di-substituted implies two substituents. So, perhaps one is an ester group, and the other is something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. Ester groups usually have R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe one substituent is an ester. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a methyl ester and another is something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. Let's think: esters have an OR group. If the substituent is an ester, say, an ethyl ester, that would have CH2CH3 groups, but the problem says there are no CH2 signals. So maybe the ester is something with a methyl group. Like a methyl ester, so OMe. But that's just one CH3.

Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals. So perhaps another substituent has a CH3 group. Maybe one substituent is an ester (like OMe) and the other is a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, but wait, the NMR also shows vinyl protons. Vinyl protons are from double bonds, like in an alkene. So perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group attached to the ring. That would explain the vinyl H's.

But wait, the di-substituted benzene with an ester and a vinyl group. But let me think about the structure. Maybe one substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-R) and the other is a vinyl group, like CH2CH2? No, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and another group that contributes the CH3 signals. Like, maybe each substituent has a CH3. Or perhaps it's an acetyl group or something else.

Wait, let me break down the NMR data:

- Aromatic protons: two signals. So in a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern can lead to different splitting. For example, in para substitution, the aromatic protons could be two sets, perhaps two doublets or something. But if it's ortho or meta, the splitting might be different. So two signals for aromatic H suggests maybe it's para substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be that each substituent is causing different environments.

- Vinyl-H: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two sets of protons. Wait, that's a bit tricky. Maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Like, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Or maybe each substituent has a vinyl group?

Wait, no, the vinyl protons are two signals. So maybe one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like, for example, a substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-O or something. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached as a substituent, but that would require the substituent to be -CH2CH2- which isn't possible on a benzene ring. Wait, no, substituents can be like -CH2CH3 but that's an ethyl group, but wait, the NMR doesn't have CH2 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethenyl group (vinyl), like -CH2CH2, but that would have CH2 groups. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ethenyl group directly attached, like -CH2CH2-. No, that can't be right. Or perhaps the substituent is something like a methyl vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group and another group that has a vinyl structure, like a propenoate or something. Let me think about how that would look. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester and another substituent is a phenyl group with a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like phenyl acetate, but that's a mono-substituted. No, we're di-substituted. So maybe two substituents, one being an ester and the other something else.

Wait, the NMR shows six signals in total. Let's count: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. So maybe each substituent contributes some protons.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. For example, if one substituent is an ester group (-O-CO-O-R?), but no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituent is O-CO-R, where R is some alkyl group. Let's say R is methyl. So the substituent is O-CO-Me. Another substituent could be a group that has a vinyl and a CH3 group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is an ortho-substituted benzene with two groups, one an ester and the other perhaps a vinyl ether or something. Or maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, but that would require the substituent to be -CH2CH2-, which as I thought before, would have CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methacrylate group? Methacrylate is an ester and has a vinyl group. So, for example, if one substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, no, wait, methacrylate is O-CO-CH2CH2-O. Wait, methacrylate is more like O-CO-CH2CH2-O? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acrylate group, which is an ester with a double bond attached.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So if one substituent is an acrylate group, that would account for the vinyl protons. So, for example, the substituent is CH2=CHCOOR, where R is a methyl group. So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one acrylate group (CH2=CHCOO-) and another group.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would have vinyl protons (the CH2=CH part) and the ester oxygen. Let's see, so the acrylate group would have the structure CH2=CHCOO-. So the aromatic ring is attached to the CH2=CHCOO- group. That would give vinyl protons on the CH2 and CH parts. But in the NMR, the vinyl Hs are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Let me think about how that would split.

The CH2 in the CH2=CH part would be next to the double bond. The CH2 protons would be a quartet if they are adjacent to a CH that is coupled to two protons (because each CH2 proton is next to a CH with two Hs). Wait, no, the CH2 would be next to the CH, which has two Hs. So each CH2 H would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH. That would lead to a triplet for the CH2 Hs. But the NMR shows a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the coupling wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the number of protons.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. So maybe each substituent contributes a CH3. For example, one substituent is an ester (e.g., O-CO-OCH2CH3) but that would have CH2 groups, which aren't present.

Wait, another thought: maybe one of the substituents is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OMe. That would give a singlet in the NMR for the three equivalent CH3 protons. But the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so maybe two different methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a methyl ester (O-CO-Me) and another substituent that is a methyl group attached to the ring. So the benzene would have two substituents: one OMe (ester) and one Me. But wait, OMe is an ester only if it's O-CO-Me. Wait, no, a methyl ester would be an OMe group connected to a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-Me, which is a methyl ester. So that substituent would be O-CO-Me. Then another substituent is a methyl group (CH3). So the benzene has O-CO-Me and CH3 as substituents.

Wait, but then the aromatic Hs would be next to these substituents. The O-CO-Me is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the substituent would be an ester group. Then the CH3 is a simple methyl group.

In that case, the NMR would have the ester's CH3 as a singlet (if it's attached to an oxygen, as in OMe). The methyl group on the ring would be a triplet perhaps? Or a singlet if it's attached directly. Wait, no, if it's attached to the benzene, it's a CH3 group, so it would be a singlet because all three Hs are equivalent and not split by anything.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps the OMe gives a singlet (one signal), and another CH3 elsewhere gives another signal. So maybe the other substituent is another CH3 group, but how?

Wait, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group that has a CH3 attached. Like, maybe it's a propenyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3), which would have a CH3 attached to a carbonyl. So in that case, the acetyl group would contribute a singlet for the CH3 (since it's attached to a carbonyl which doesn't split the peak). Then the other substituent could be another group, perhaps an OMe group.

Wait, let me think. If the two substituents are OMe and COCH3, then the ester would be from the OMe, but wait, OMe is an ether, not an ester. Oh wait, no, the ester is OMe attached to a carbonyl, like in methyl benzoate. But then, the other substituent would be COCH3. Wait, no, methyl benzoate has the structure PhCOOCH3. But that's a mono-substituted benzoate. Wait, but in this case, it's di-substituted, so maybe there's another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group (CH3) and an ester group (like O-CO-R). So one substituent is CH3, the other is O-CO-R.

Wait, but then how about the vinyl protons? Oh, maybe the substituent has a vinyl group. So the substituent could be a vinyl ester, like perhaps O-CO-CH2CH2-O or something. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Let me think about the structure. For example, one substituent is O-CO-Me (methyl ester), and the other is a vinyl group, like -CH2CH2-. But that would have CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group or something like that. Wait, another approach: let's count the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure.

The formula options are:

A) C11H14O2: Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*11 +2 -14)/2= (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees: likely one ring (benzene) and two double bonds (ester and another double bond, perhaps the vinyl group).

B) C12H14O2: (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. One ring, two double bonds, and one triple bond? Or maybe another ring or double bond. But more likely, one ring and two double bonds (like benzene and an ester and a vinyl group).

C) C12H12O2: (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7. So benzene (3), ester (1), and another double bond (maybe a vinyl group) would account for 5, but that leaves two more. Hmm, perhaps another ring or some other double bond.

D) C11H12O2: (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. So one ring (3), ester (1), and another double bond (maybe vinyl), that's 5. One more degree would be another ring or maybe a triple bond, but that's less likely.

Wait, back to the substituents. The presence of vinyl protons suggests a double bond somewhere else besides the aromatic ring. So perhaps the substituent has a double bond, like in an ester group with an alpha,beta-unsaturated structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester. For example, the structure would be benzene with a substituent like O-CO-CH2CH2CH2- but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, allyl ester would be O-CO-CH2CH=CH2. But that would have a double bond, which would give vinyl protons.

Hmm, but then the substituent would have CH2 groups. The NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, so that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, like a styrene group (CH2=CH- attached to the benzene). But then the substituent would be CH2=CH-, which would have two protons. But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals, so perhaps that's the case. So, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), but attached in such a way that the two CH2 groups have different environments.

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2=CH-, then the two CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have different environments. For example, the CH2 attached to the benzene would have different coupling than the CH2 on the other side. Wait, but that would be more about the substituent's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoyl group, like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. That would give the ester group and a vinyl group.

So the structure would be benzene with substituents: one being O-CO-CH2-CH2-O and the other something else? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again. Two aromatic protons: maybe the substituents are in the para position, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other, leading to two different sets of aromatic protons.

The vinyl protons: one is a doublet (maybe each vinyl proton is coupled with another set), and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent.

Wait, another approach: the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but no, esters are O-CO-R, not O-CO-O-R. So R is the alkoxy part. So the structure is R-O-CO- attached to the benzene.

So, R could be a vinyl group. So the substituent would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps R is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-.

Wait, if the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, that would be an ester with a propyl group, but that might not fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. For example, O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's similar to what I just thought.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should count the total number of protons.

The molecular formula options have varying numbers of H. Let me see:

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic H signals: but how many Hs? For a di-substituted benzene, depending on substitution pattern, the number of aromatic Hs can vary. For example, in para substitution, there are two sets of H (each set has two Hs). So maybe four Hs in total for aromatic.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. For a di-substituted benzene, the number of aromatic Hs depends on the substitution pattern. Let's say it's para substitution: then there are two sets of two Hs each (each set is opposite each other). So each set would give a singlet or a doublet, depending on coupling. But FT in the NMR says two signals, which could be two doublets.

But the problem says the NMR shows six signals. But wait, the question says "two signals corresponding to aromatic-H". So perhaps there are two types of aromatic H. So maybe two Hs in each signal, but that depends.

Wait, but for a di-substituted benzene, the number of distinct aromatic Hs can be 2, 3, or 4, depending on the substituents. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of Hs, each with two Hs. So two doublets in the NMR. That matches the description: two aromatic H signals.

So that's possible.

Then, the vinyl-H: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps two sets of vinyl Hs, each set with two Hs. So a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Maybe each set is split by different neighboring protons.

And then two CH3 signals. So two different CH3 groups, each with three Hs.

So, putting this together, the molecule has:

- A benzene ring with two substituents, likely in para positions, giving two aromatic H signals (each a doublet, perhaps).

- A substituent that has a vinyl group, contributing two sets of vinyl Hs.

- Two methyl groups, each contributing a CH3 signal.

Looking for a structure that fits this.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. So one substituent is an ester group, O-CO-R, and the other is a vinyl group, CH2=CH-.

Wait, but the vinyl group would require a substituent like CH2=CH-. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O. No, that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (O-CO-R) and the other substituent is an allyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), but that would have CH2 groups again.

This is tricky. Let me think about the molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

Each option has O2, as expected because of the ester group.

So, the ester contributes O2 (since it's R-O-CO-R'). So the rest of the structure must contribute the rest.

Let's think about the substituents. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-R. Then, R would be an alkyl group. The other substituent would be another group, perhaps a methyl group, but how?

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the molecular formula.

Assume the benzene ring is C6H4 (since it's di-substituted). Then, the substituents contribute the rest.

Each substituent would add to this. Since the molecule has an ester group, which is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

So, the ester group contributes O-CO-R. Let's suppose R is a methyl group (Me). So the ester substituent would be O-CO-Me, which is -O-CO-CH3.

So, that substituent would add O2 (from ester) and CH3.

The other substituent would contribute the rest. Let's say the other substituent is a methyl group (CH3), so the molecule would have two substituents: O-CO-Me and CH3.

So, the formula would be C6H4 (from benzene) + O2 (from ester) + CH3 (from ester R group) + CH3 (other substituent) → C6 + (O2) + (CH3) + (CH3) → C6 + 2 C (from CH3 groups) + O2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute:

Benzene is C6H6. When di-substituted, it becomes C6H4 (since two Hs are replaced by substituents). So the rest of the substituents must account for the rest of the carbons and hydrogens.

If the ester substituent is O-CO-Me, that's (O-CO-CH3). So, the substituent adds 2 O's and 1 C. The other substituent is CH3, which adds 1 C and 3 H's.

So, the formula from the substituents:

O-CO-Me: O2, C=2 (O-CO is part of the ester, so the R in R-O-CO- is Me, which is CH3. So, for the substituent O-CO-Me, it's O2, C=2 (since the benzene's C is part of the ring, the substituent adds O2 and C=2? Wait, no, the substituent is -O-CO-CH3, which has:

O (from the ether linkage), then CO, then CH3. So, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which is 2 O's, 3 C's (O-CO-CH3 is O-CO-R, R=CH3, so substituent is O-CO-CH3, which has 3 C's and 2 O's.

Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which is O attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to a methyl group. So, the substituent contributes 3 C's (O, CO, CH3), but wait, the O is part of the substituent.

Wait, in any case, the molecule would be benzene (C6) plus substituents.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 → adds 3 C (O isn't a C), wait no, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, so the carbons are the CO and CH3. So, 2 C's from CO and CH3. Wait, the substituent is -O-CO-OCH3? No, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So substituent is R-O-CO-R', but in this case, if R is H (but that can't be, because that would be a phenol ester). Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Let me try to think of the substituent as O-CO-Me. So, substituent is O-CO-CH3. That's 3 carbons (the O is not a C, but the CO is part of the substituent). So, how many C's does this substituent add? The substituent is -O-CO-CH3. So, substituent has 3 C's (O, C from CO, and CH3). Wait, no, the substituent is attached as an ester, so the structure is benzene-O-CO-CH3. So, the substituent's formula is C3H3O2. Wait, benzene-O-CO-CH3 would be C7H6O2.

Plus another substituent, which is CH3, so adding C1H3.

So the total structure would be C7 (from first substituent) + C1 (from second substituent) → C8. But the options go up to C12. So perhaps I'm not considering this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are larger. For example, one substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). That would be substituent with 3 C's (O-CO-CH2CH3). So substituent adds 3 C's, 5 H's (from CH2CH3).

The other substituent could be another methyl group, adding 1 C and 3 H's.

So, benzene (6 C) + substituents (3 + 1 =4 C) → total 10 C. But the options only go up to C12, and the highest is B) C12H14O2 and C) C12H12O2.

Wait, maybe the substituents are larger. Or perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, which would have more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester group, each contributing additional carbons.

Wait, let's try to calculate the molecular formula.

Assume the molecule is benzene (C6H6) with two substituents.

Each substituent contributes to the formula.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group: O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. The other substituent could be another group.

Let me consider substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (n-propyl ester). That's 3 C's from R. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which has 3 C's, 6 H's (from R), 2 O's.

Substituent 2: perhaps another methyl group, CH3.

So total structure: C6 (benzene) + substituent 1 (3 C) + substituent 2 (1 C) → 10 C's.

Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H, but as di-substituted, 4 H remain (assuming para substitution). Substituent 1: R is CH2CH2CH3, which has 6 H's. Substituent 2: CH3 has 3 H's.

So total H: 4 (aromatic) + 6 (ester R) +3 (CH3) =13. Plus any H's from other substituents. Wait, but the ester substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which has 6 H's (CH2CH2CH3 is three CH2 groups, each with 2 H, and a CH3 with 3 H? Wait, no, n-propyl is CH2CH2CH3. So the substituent would have:

O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 → the R group is CH2CH2CH3 (3 C), which has 7 H's (each CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H). So substituent 1 contributes 7 H.

Substituent 2: CH3 contributes 3 H.

So total H: aromatic (4) + substituent 1 (7) + substituent 2 (3) = 14 H.

O's: from substituent 1, 2 O's. No O's from substituent 2. So total O's:2.

So molecular formula would be C10H14O2.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A) C11H14O2 and option B) C12H14O2. So 10 C is not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are larger.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The NMR has two CH3 signals, which suggests two different methyl groups. So, perhaps one methyl is attached to an oxygen (like OMe) and another is attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, but the ester group would have a methyl group as OMe. So that's one CH3 (singlet). Then, the other CH3 could be part of a vinyl group, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the other substituent is a methyl group attached to a double bond, like in a propenoyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group on a vinyl group. For example, substituent could be CH2=CHCOOCH3. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, and another substituent is a methyl group.

Wait, but that would bring back CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (like O-CO-R) and a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-). The vinyl group would account for the vinyl H's.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-R (ester)

Substituent 2: CH2=CH- (vinyl)

But then the substituent 2 would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: since there are no CH2 groups in the NMR, the structure must be free of any contiguous CH2 groups. So any substituents must have branching or double bonds to avoid CH2.

So, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and an ester group that doesn't have any CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a propenoyl group (like CH2=CHCOO-). Let me think.

Propenoyl group: CH2=CHCOO- attached to benzene.

So substituent 1: CH2=CHCOO- (which is an ester, since it's O-CO-R).

Substituent 2: CH3 (methyl group).

So, benzene with two substituents: CH2=CHCOO- and CH3.

Now, let's think about the NMR signals.

Aromatic H's: benzene is di-substituted, so two sets. Let's say para substitution, so two doublets.

Vinyl H's: from the CH2=CHCOO- group. The CH2 would have two H's, and the CH would have two H's. But wait, the structure is CH2=CHCOO-, so the CH2 is adjacent to the double bond. The protons on CH2 would be coupled with the protons on the adjacent CH.

So for the CH2 group in CH2=CHCOO-:

Each H on CH2 would be next to two H's on the CH group. So each H on CH2 would be split into a triplet (n+1, where n=2). But wait, the NMR shows one signal as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl protons are on a different arrangement.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCOO-. So the CH2 is adjacent to the double bond, and the CH (from CH2=CH-) is adjacent to the COO group.

The H's on the CH2 would be split by the H's on the CH. Since each CH2 H is next to two H's on the CH, each CH2 H would be a triplet.

The H's on the CH would be split by the H's on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps any other coupling. If the CH is adjacent to a carbonyl group, which is deshielded and perhaps doesn't split, the H's on CH would be a quartet (from coupling with two H's on CH2).

Wait, but the NMR shows one signal as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a conjugated system, leading to more complex splitting.

But regardless, the important thing is that the substituent has a CH2 and a CH group, each with two H's, leading to two different signals.

So, the NMR would show the CH2 as a triplet and the CH as a quartet, but the problem states two signals: a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe it's more about the substituent's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group attached to an oxygen, but that would bring back CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ether group, like O-CH2-CH2-O. No, that would have CH2 groups.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the molecular formula.

If substituent 1 is CH2=CHCOO- (propenoyl ester), that's 4 C's (CH2=CHCOO- has 4 C's: CH2, CH, COO-).

Substituent 2 is CH3.

So, total C's: benzene (6) + substituent 1 (4) + substituent 2 (1) = 11 C's.

Hydrogen calculation:

Benzene di-substituted: 4 H.

Substituent 1: CH2=CHCOO-.

CH2: 2 H.

CH: 2 H.

O-CO-O-: the ester oxygen doesn't add H. So substituent 1 contributes 4 H.

Substituent 2: CH3 → 3 H.

Total H: 4 +4 +3=11.

Wait, but the formula options have higher H counts. Let's see, substituent 1 (CH2=CHCOO-) would have more H's. Wait, CH2=CHCOO- has CH2 (2 H), CH (2 H), and the ester group (O-CO-O-) attached to R. Wait, no, the R is the benzene, so substituent 1 is CH2=CHCOO-Ph. So substituent 1 is Ph-CH2=CHCOO-.

Wait, no, that would be a different structure. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2=CH2. So, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2=CH2.

But that would have a CH2=CH2 group attached to the ester. So, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-O, but that would have ethylene glycol ester, which isn't likely.

I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should think about the degrees of unsaturation.

The molecular formula options for the correct answer should have the correct number of double bonds and rings.

Assuming the correct answer is option C) C12H12O2, which has 7 degrees of unsaturation.

That would account for the benzene ring (3), the ester group (1), and another double bond (1), totaling 5. Wait, that leaves two more, which could be another ring or another double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a double bond, adding another degree.

Wait, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Maybe another approach: the number of signals in the NMR.

The NMR has six signals. Each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons.

So, two aromatic Hs (maybe two doublets), two vinyl Hs (doublet and doublet of quartets), and two CH3 groups (each a triplet or singlet).

The substituents must account for all these signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (O-CO-Me) and a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-). But that would include CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is a methyl ester (O-CO-Me) and substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). But again, that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring, but that's a stretch.

I think I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to look at the possible options.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 C, 14 H.

B) C12H14O2 →12 C,14 H.

C) C12H12O2 →12 C,12 H.

D) C11H12O2 →11 C,12 H.

Assuming the structure is benzene with two substituents, each substituent adds a certain number of C and H.

An ester group (like O-CO-R) adds (for R = Me) 3 C's and 3 H's (from O-CO-CH3). Another substituent, say, a methyl group (CH3), adds 1 C and 3 H's.

So, total C: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester R) +1 (CH3) =10 C. Not matching any option.

If R is ethyl (O-CO-CH2CH3), that adds 4 C's (COO, CH2, CH3) and 5 H's (CH2CH3). Plus another substituent, say, CH3, adds 1 C and 3 H's. So total C:6+4+1=11 C. H:4 (aromatic) +5 (ester R) +3 (CH3) =12 H.

So molecular formula would be C11H12O2, which is option D.

Wait, but the NMR shows six signals, including two CH3. If substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), that would have a CH2CH3 group, which would give a triplet and a quartet, but the NMR doesn't show CH2 signals. So that can't be right.

Hmm, so that approach may not fit.

Wait, another substituent: perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2-O, which would have CH2 groups. But again, NMR shows no CH2 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), and substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So substituent 2 is CH2=CH- attached to benzene. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a CH3 group attached to the benzene. So substituents are O-CO-CH3 and CH3.

In that case, the molecule would be benzene-O-CO-CH3 and benzene-CH3. So the formula would be C8H8O2. But none of the options are C8.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are larger. Maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), which would add 3 C's and 6 H's. Substituent 2 is another CH3, adding 1 C and 3 H's. So, 6 (benzene) +3 +1=10 C. H: from benzene (4), substituent 1 (6), substituent 2 (3) →13 H. O: 2.

So formula would be C10H13O2. Not in the options.

Hmm. Maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2OCH3. No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2O-. No, that would require another oxygen.

I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible answers.

The correct answer is likely C) C12H12O2 or B) C12H14O2.

Because the NMR shows two CH3 groups, which would imply more carbons. So perhaps the structure has more substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a propenoyl group. For example, substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ester), substituent 2: CH2=CHCOO- (another ester group). Wait, that would make the molecule have two ester groups, which is possible.

But the FTIR shows only ester presence, so maybe only one ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2O-. No, that's unlikely.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should make a guess based on the options and the NMR data.

The NMR has two CH3 groups. So the molecular formula should have at least two CH3 groups. The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 C, 14 H.

B) C12H14O2 →12 C,14 H.

C) C12H12O2 →12 C,12 H.

D) C11H12O2 →11 C,12 H.

The number of H's in the molecule is important. For option D, 12 H, but the NMR shows 6 signals, which would imply different environments.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C12H12O2 (option C). Let's see.

So, benzene has 6 C. The substituents add 6 C's (since 12-6=6). So substituents could be two groups each adding 3 C's.

For example, one substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 3 C's) and another substituent is CH(CH3)2. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in NMR.

Alternatively, substituent 1 could be O-CO-CH2CH3 (3 C) and substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C). So total C is 6+3+1=10. Not 12.

Hmm.

Another approach: the number of H in the molecule.

Option C: C12H12O2 → 12 C and 12 H.

Assuming benzene (6 C, 4 H after substitution) plus substituents.

Each substituent adds some C and H.

Suppose substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (3 C, 5 H), substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

Total C:6+3+1=10. H:4+5+3=12.

So the formula would be C10H12O2. But option C is C12H12O2, which is 12 C. So I'm missing 2 C's.

Ah, maybe substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (n-propyl ester, 4 C's: O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 → so substituent 1 is 4 C's, 7 H's).

Substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C, 3 H).

So total C:6+4+1=11 → which matches option D (C11H...).

H:4 (aromatic) +7 (ester R) +3 (CH3) =14 H. So formula would be C11H14O2, which is option A.

But the NMR shows no CH2 groups. The substituent O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 has CH2 groups, which would appear as a quartet and triplet in NMR, but the problem states there are no CH2 signals. So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C) C12H12O2.

But I'm not certain. Another way to think: the NMR has two CH3 groups. Each contributes 3 H. So 6 H from CH3. Then aromatic H: 4, vinyl H: 4 (two signals, each with 2 H). So total H: 6 +4 +4=14. That makes me think the formula has 14 H's, which would be options A or B.

But option A is C11H14O2, and B is C12H14O2.

Wait, but the aromatic H can't be 4 H because di-substituted benzene could have 4 H (like para substitution) but that depends.

Wait, the NMR shows two aromatic H signals, which could be two sets of two H each → 4 H. Vinyl H: two signals, say, each has 2 H → 4 H. CH3: two signals, each 3 H → 6 H. Total H: 4 +4 +6=14 H. So the molecular formula should have 14 H.

Looking at the options, which have H=14? Options A and B.

So the correct formula is either A) C11H14O2 or B) C12H14O2.

Now, the number of C's: if the structure has 11 C's, what would that imply? Benzene (6) + substituents adding 5 C's.

Substituent 1: ester → O-CO-R. Let R be CH2CH2CH3 (n-propyl), which adds 3 C's. So substituent 1 adds 3 C's. Substituent 2: another group adding 2 C's. Maybe a CH2CH3 group, but that would have CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a CH3 group, adding 1 C. So 3+1=4 C's. Benzene (6) +4=10 C's. Not 11.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (butyl ester, 4 C's). Substituent 2: CH3 (1 C). So 6+4+1=11 C's. Then H's would be: benzene (4) + substituent 1 (7 H) + substituent 2 (3 H) =14 H.

So formula would be C11H14O2, which is option A.

But wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3, which has CH2 groups. The NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl ester). That would have substituent 1 as O-CO-CH(CH3)2, which contributes 3 C's (COO, CH, and two CH3). So substituent 1 adds 3 C's and 6 H's (from the two CH3 groups). Substituent 2: CH3, adding 1 C and 3 H's.

So total C:6 +3 +1=10. Not matching option A (11 C).

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2O- something. No, that would add more O's.

I think I'm stuck again. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option C) C12H12O2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, based on the H count, it's option A or B.

Wait, the molecular formula with 14 H is either A or B.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester, 3 C's, 3 H's), and substituent 2 is a CH2CH2 group, but that would have CH2, which isn't present.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 4 C's, 5 H's), substituent 2 is CH3 (1 C, 3 H's). So total C:6+4+1=11, H:4+5+3=12. So formula would be C11H12O2 (option D). But the NMR shows 14 H's.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think that the correct answer is option D) C11H12O2.

But earlier calculation says that the H's are 14, matching option A or B.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C) C12H12O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following key information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals corresponding to aromatic protons suggest a di-substituted benzene ring, likely in a para substitution pattern, resulting in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, indicate the presence of a vinyl group (C=C) with two distinct environments for the protons.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals corresponding to CH3 groups suggest the presence of two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.
4. **No CH2 signals**: The absence of signals corresponding to CH2 groups implies that the molecule does not contain contiguous CH2 groups.

### Analysis of the Molecular Formula Options:
The molecular formula must account for the aromatic ring, the ester group, the vinyl group, and the two methyl groups. Each option is evaluated based on the number of carbons (C), hydrogens (H), and the degrees of unsaturation.

#### **Option A: C11H14O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation:  
  \[
  \text{DOU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 14}{2} = 5
  \]
  This accounts for the benzene ring (3 DOU), the ester group (1 DOU), and the vinyl group (1 DOU), leaving no additional unsaturation.  
- Hydrogen count: The molecule has 14 H, which matches the sum of aromatic protons (4), vinyl protons (4), and methyl protons (6).  
- This option is plausible.

#### **Option B: C12H14O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation:  
  \[
  \text{DOU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 14}{2} = 6
  \]
  This accounts for the benzene ring (3 DOU), the ester group (1 DOU), and the vinyl group (1 DOU), with 1 additional degree of unsaturation, possibly from a double bond or ring.  
- Hydrogen count: The molecule has 14 H, which matches the sum of aromatic protons (4), vinyl protons (4), and methyl protons (6).  
- This option is also plausible.

#### **Option C: C12H12O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation:  
  \[
  \text{DOU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 12}{2} = 7
  \]
  This accounts for the benzene ring (3 DOU), the ester group (1 DOU), and the vinyl group (1 DOU), with 2 additional degrees of unsaturation, possibly from additional double bonds or rings.  
- Hydrogen count: The molecule has 12 H, which does not match the expected sum of aromatic protons (4), vinyl protons (4), and methyl protons (6).  
- This option is less likely.

#### **Option D: C11H12O2**
- Degrees of unsaturation:  
  \[
  \text{DOU} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 12}{2} = 6
  \]
  This accounts for the benzene ring (3 DOU), the ester group (1 DOU), and the vinyl group (1 DOU), with 1 additional degree of unsaturation.  
- Hydrogen count: The molecule has 12 H, which does not match the expected sum of aromatic protons (4), vinyl protons (4), and methyl protons (6).  
- This option is less likely.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data indicates 14 hydrogens, which matches **Option A (C11H14O2)** and **Option B (C12H14O2)**. However, the molecular formula must also align with the absence of CH2 groups. Based on the analysis, **Option A (C11H14O2)** is the most consistent with the given data.
