Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts here. Let me read the question again and break it down.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, but it has dark spots covering one hemisphere. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The question is about how the brightness variations caused by these spots compare to those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star.

The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots do. So, we need to compare the dip in brightness caused by the spots to the dip caused by a planet.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness (the transit depth) is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. So if we can find the equivalent effect of the spots on the star's brightness, we can set that equal to the planet's effect and solve for R_planet / R_star.

But wait, the star's spots aren't uniform brightness. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. But because the star is rotating, as the spots come into and out of view, the observed brightness changes. The question says that the photometric observations would show periodic variations, similar to an exoplanet.

Wait, but the exoplanet's effect is a dip when it passes in front of the star. The spot effect is a variation in brightness as the spots rotate into and out of view. So the two situations produce different light curves, but the problem states that the amplitude of the brightness variations (i.e., the maximum dip) caused by the spots is equivalent to what an exoplanet would cause.

So, I need to model the brightness drop due to the spots and set it equal to the planet transit's drop, then find the ratio R_planet / R_star.

Let me think. The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so each spot contributes less light. The filling factor (f) is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots.

Wait, the star's surface emits according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. The spots are cooler, with Teff_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the total brightness when the spots are visible would be the normal star's brightness minus the brightness contributed by the spots plus the brightness from the unspotted areas.

Wait, no. The star's hemisphere without spots is at 6000K, and the spots are at 5000K. The filling factor f is 0.2, so 20% of the hemisphere is spots, and 80% is normal.

But wait, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. The maximum brightness would be when the spotless hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

But how does this affect the observed brightness?

Let me model the star's brightness as two parts: the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted. When the star rotates, we see half of each at different times. Wait, no. When it's a hemisphere, perhaps we see the entire hemisphere when it's facing us. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, our Sun is a sphere, so when a star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere facing us is the one we see. So if one hemisphere is covered in spots, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view as the star spins. So at any given time, we see either the spotted or the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to move into and out of view. So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star emits light from both hemispheres, right? No, wait, the star's surface is a sphere. If one hemisphere is spotted, then when we look at the star, we see the entire surface, but only part of it is spotted. Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the surface. So if one hemisphere is entirely covered in spots, then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. Alternatively, the star may be rotating such that the spot hemisphere comes into view.

Wait, perhaps the spot covers a fraction f of the surface of one hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is f * (2π R²), since the surface area of a hemisphere is 2π R².

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. So the total area of the spots is f * (2π R²) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot is at T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

So the total luminosity from the spots is L_spots = (Area of spots) * σ T_spot^4.

Similarly, the total luminosity of the star is L_star = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But wait, if part of the star's surface is cooler, the total luminosity would be (area of spots)*σ T_spot^4 + (area of non-spots)*σ T_normal^4.

But wait, when the star isn't rotating, the entire surface is emitting. But when a spot is on the hemisphere facing us, it reduces the observed brightness.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted is facing. But that's only if the spots are on one hemisphere. Alternatively, if the star is rotating so that spots come into view, the brightness variation would depend on the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted and their temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the brightness as a function of time. Let me think of the star as having a certain fraction of its surface covered by spots. But the question says only one hemisphere is covered, meaning that the spots are on one side (like the front) but when the star rotates, the other hemisphere (unspotted) comes into view.

Wait, but if the star is rotating, perhaps the spots are on the side, so when it's facing us, the spots are on the edge or something? Wait, no, I think the problem is that the star has a dark spot covering a portion of one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip.

But perhaps the model is that the star's brightness varies as the spotted region moves into and out of the observer's view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, which are cooler, making the star appear dimmer.

Wait, but if the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and if the spot covers 20% of one hemisphere, how does that affect the total brightness?

Wait, the problem says the spot has a filling factor of 20%, which is the area of the spots divided by the area of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R², since a hemisphere has area 2π R². So area of spots = 0.4 π R².

The brightness without any spots would be L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But with spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness would be L_spotted = (area of non-spots)*σ (6000)^4 + (area of spots)*σ (5000)^4.

Non-spots area is (1 - f) * 2π R². Wait, wait, no. The hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% is covered in spots. So non-spots area is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

So L_spotted = [1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4 ] + [0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4 ].

But wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is L_unspotted = 2π R² (non-spots on hemisphere) * σ (6000)^4 plus the other hemisphere (unspotted) which is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4. So the total L0 is 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps in the case of the spots, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, part of the star's surface is cooler. The brightness variation would be the difference between the unspotted and spotted (when the spots are visible) scenarios.

So the maximum brightness (when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible) is L_max = L0.

The minimum brightness (when the spotted hemisphere is visible) is L_min = L0 * (average brightness of spotted hemisphere / average brightness of whole star).

Wait, the average brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be:

The spotted hemisphere has area 2π R², with 80% at 6000 K and 20% at 5000 K.

So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

F_spotted_hemisphere = [ (0.8)*(2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2)*(2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ] / (2π R² )

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of flux per unit area.

The flux from the unspotted part of the hemisphere is 0.8 * (σ (6000)^4 ), and from the spotted part is 0.2 * (σ (5000)^4 ). So the average flux from the spotted hemisphere is 0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4).

But wait, the entire star's surface is 4π R². So when the star is unspotted, the flux is 4π R² * σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux from that hemisphere is (2π R²) * [ 0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ) ] * σ.

The other hemisphere is the same as the star's unspotted (if the other hemisphere is unspotted?), but the question says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the other (unspotted) hemisphere is at 6000 K.

Wait, wait, no. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the other hemisphere is normal.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux contribution is from the spotted hemisphere plus the unspotted hemisphere. Wait, no, each hemisphere is 2π R². So the spotted hemisphere contributes:

F_spotted = (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000^4) + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000^4)

The unspotted hemisphere contributes:

F_unspotted = 2π R² * σ (6000^4)

So total flux when spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted + F_unspotted.

But wait, I think that's incorrect because the flux from the entire star is the sum of both hemispheres. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux from that hemisphere is F_spotted, and the other hemisphere (which is unspotted) contributes F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted_hemi + F_unspotted_hemi.

Wait, but that would be the same as when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. No, because when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is spotted, but since it's not facing us, we don't see it. Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, no, when a hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is on the back side, and whether it's spotted or not doesn't affect the observed flux. Because we can't see it.

Wait, no. When the star is a sphere, the front hemisphere is what we see. The back hemisphere is not visible. So when the spotted hemisphere is the front, we see all the spots. When the star rotates so that the unspotted hemisphere is the front, we don't see any spots.

Wait, that can't be right because the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view as it rotates. But the question says that one hemisphere is spotty, so perhaps the spots are entirely on one side, so when that side faces us, we see the spots.

Wait, perhaps the star is such that when it's viewed from Earth, the hemisphere with spots is the one we see, but as the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of view. Wait, maybe not. I'm getting stuck on the geometry.

Alternative approach: perhaps model the brightness variation caused by the spots as a dip when the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

The maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the brightness difference (delta L) is L_max - L_min.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness. So the amplitude A = (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

But wait, in the case of a planet transit, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, so the amplitude is the fractional change in brightness.

So for the spots, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the brightness is lower than when the unspotted is visible. So the amplitude would be (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Wait, but I'm not sure about whether it's the difference between L_max and L_min. Let me think.

The star's normal (unspotted) brightness is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the brightness is:

L_spotted = (unspotted part of the hemisphere) * σ (6000)^4 + (spotted part of the hemisphere) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, the unspotted part is 80% of the hemisphere, so 0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The spotted part is 0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So:

L_spotted = [0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ]

Which can be factored as:

L_spotted = 2π R² σ [ 0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

The normal brightness when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the front hemisphere is unspotted, so the front contributes 2π R² * σ (6000)^4, and the back hemisphere is spotted, but we don't see it. Wait, no, because the back hemisphere isn't visible. So the brightness when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is L_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, that can't be right because the total brightness of the star (without any spots) is 4π R² σ (6000)^4. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front is spotted, and the back is unspotted, but we don't see the back. So the brightness is:

L_spotted = front hemisphere's luminosity.

Front hemisphere's luminosity is (unspotted part) * σ (6000)^4 + (spotted part) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no, the front hemisphere is the one we see. The back is the other hemisphere, which is the same as the front depends on how the star is viewed.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should simplify.

Let me think of the star's total brightness when the front is spotted.

The front hemisphere has 20% spots at 5000 K, 80% normal at 6000 K.

So the luminosity from the front is 0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

The back hemisphere is unspotted (since only one hemisphere is spotty), so it contributes 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. If the entire back hemisphere is unspotted, then yes.

So the total luminosity when the front is spotted is:

L_spotted = [0.8 * 2π R² (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2π R² (5000^4)] * σ + [2π R² (6000^4)] * σ.

Wait, no, because when the front is spotted, the back is the same as the front; no, the back is the other hemisphere. Wait, if only the front hemisphere is spotted, then when the front is facing us, the back is unspotted. So the front's luminosity is as calculated, and the back's is 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

So total L_spotted = [0.8 * 2π R² (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2π R² (5000^4)] * σ + [2π R² (6000^4)] * σ.

Wait, that would be L_spotted = (0.8+0.2) * 2π R² (6000^4) * σ + 0.2 * 2π R² (5000^4) * σ.

Wait, no, 0.8 * 2π R² is the unspotted part of the front, and 0.2 * 2π R² is the spotted part.

So L_spotted = [0.8*(2π R²) (6000^4) + 0.2*(2π R²)(5000^4)] * σ + [2π R² (6000^4)] * σ.

Wait, but wait, the back hemisphere is unspotted, so it contributes 2π R² * σ (6000^4).

So L_spotted = [0.8 * 2π R² (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2π R² (5000^4)] + [2π R² (6000^4)].

Wait, no, because the front and back are both contributing. So the total is:

L_spotted = (front contribution) + (back contribution).

Front contribution: 0.8*(2π R²) * σ (6000^4) + 0.2*(2π R²) * σ (5000^4).

Back contribution: 2π R² * σ (6000^4).

So L_spotted = [ (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) * 2π R² * σ ] + [2π R² * σ (6000^4) ]

= [ (0.8 *6000^4 +0.2*5000^4) + 1 *6000^4 ) ] * 2π R² σ

Wait, no, because each term is multiplied by 2π R² σ.

Wait, no, let me recompute:

Front contribution = 0.8*(2π R²) σ (6000^4) + 0.2*(2π R²) σ (5000^4) = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)].

Back contribution = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

So total L_spotted = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4) + 6000^4].

Wait, that adds the front and back contributions.

Wait, 0.8*(front) + 0.2*(front) = front part.

Plus the back part, which is (2π R² σ 6000^4).

So total L_spotted = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) + 6000^4 * (1)].

Wait, because the front's 0.8 + 0.2 = 1, so front is 2π R² σ (6000^4) [0.8 + 0.2] = 2π R² σ (6000^4), and the back is 2π R² σ (6000^4). So total L_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4) + 2π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.2*2π R² σ (5000^4 -6000^4).

Wait, no, perhaps I should factor it correctly.

Wait, front is 0.8*(2π R² σ 6000^4) + 0.2*(2π R² σ 5000^4) = 2π R² σ [0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ].

Back is 2π R² σ 6000^4.

So L_spotted = [0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 + 6000^4 ] * 2π R² σ.

= [ (0.8 + 1) *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ) ] * 2π R² σ.

= [1.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ] * 2π R² σ.

Wait, but how does this compare to the normal star's luminosity, which is 4π R² σ 6000^4.

Wait, if the star is entirely unspotted, L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

In this case, when the front is spotted, the star's total luminosity is L_spotted = [1.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ] * 2π R² σ.

But wait, 2π R² is half the surface area. So L_spotted = [1.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ] * 2π R² σ.

Similarly, L0 = 4π R² σ (6000^4) = [ 2 *6000^4 ] * 2π R² σ.

Wait, wait:

Wait, L0 = 4π R² σ (6000^4) = 4 * π R² σ (6000^4).

But in the spotted case, the L_spotted is:

[1.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ] * 2π R² σ.

So, to find the brightness when the front is spotted, we can compute L_spotted.

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to compute the ratio of L_spotted to L0.

So:

L_spotted = [1.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4)] * 2π R² σ.

L0 = 4π R² σ (6000^4).

So the ratio L_spotted / L0 is:

[ (1.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4)) * 2π R² σ ] / [4π R² σ (6000^4) ]

= [ (1.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)) * 2 ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

Simplify denominator: 4.

So:

= [ (1.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4)) * 2 ] / (4 *6000^4 )

= [ (1.8*(6000^4) +0.2*(5000^4)) ] / (2 *6000^4 )

= [1.8 + 0.2*(5000^4 /6000^4) ) ] / 2

Compute 5000^4 /6000^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ let's compute:

0.8333^2 = ~0.6944.

Then squared, 0.6944^2 ≈ ~0.48225.

So 5000^4 /6000^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So the numerator becomes:

1.8 + 0.2 * 0.48225 = 1.8 + 0.09645 = 1.89645.

Divide by 2: 1.89645 /2 ≈ 0.948225.

So L_spotted / L0 ≈ 0.948225.

So the brightness when the front is spotted is about 94.8% of the normal brightness.

Wait, but when the front is unspotted, the entire front is 6000 K, and the back is spotted.

Wait, no, when the front is unspotted, the front is 2π R² *6000^4, and the back is 2π R² * (some spots, but we don't see it. So the total is 4π R² *6000^4, which is L0.

Wait, no. When the front is unspotted, the front's luminosity is 2π R² σ (6000^4), and the back is also 2π R² σ (6000^4), because the back is spotted, but we don't see it. So the total luminosity is 4π R² σ (6000^4), which is L0.

Wait, no, the back is the other hemisphere, which is spotted. So when the front is unspotted, the back is spotted, but we don't see it. So the front is 2π R² σ (6000^4), and the back is 2π R² [0.8 * σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * σ (5000^4) ].

Wait, but we don't see the back. So the observed luminosity is only the front's. So when the front is unspotted, the observed brightness is 2π R² σ (6000^4).

When the front is spotted, the observed brightness is [0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000^4) ].

So, maximum brightness is when front is unspotted: L_max = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

Minimum brightness is when front is spotted: L_min = [0.8 *6000^4 +0.2 *5000^4 ] * 2π R² σ.

So the amplitude A is (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

Compute L_max = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

Compute L_min = [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] * 2π R² σ.

So A = (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Compute (L_max - L_min) = 2π R² σ (6000^4) * [ 1 - (0.8 + 0.2*(5000^4/6000^4)) ].

Wait, let's factor out 2π R² σ (6000^4):

(L_max - L_min) = 2π R² σ (6000^4) [ 1 - 0.8 - 0.2*(5000^4)/(6000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ (6000^4) [ 0.2 - 0.2*(5000^4/6000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ (6000^4) * 0.2 [ 1 - (5000^4/6000^4) ]

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ]

We previously found (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So (L_max - L_min) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) * 0.51775.

= (0.4 * 0.51775) π R² σ (6000^4 )

= 0.2071 π R² σ (6000^4 )

Then, L_max is 2 π R² σ (6000^4).

So A = (0.2071 π R² σ ) / (2 π R² σ ) ) = 0.2071 / 2 = 0.10355.

So the amplitude A is approximately 10.355%.

Wait, but that's the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.

Now, the planet transit would produce an amplitude of (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So we set (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.10355.

Wait, because when the planet transits, the fractional dip is (Rp/Rs)^2.

So solving for R_p / R_s:

R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316, but let me compute it more accurately.

0.10355^0.5 = ?

Well, 0.1 is about 0.316, 0.1024 is 0.32 (since 0.32^2=0.1024). So 0.10355 is a bit more than 0.1024, so sqrt would be about 0.321 or 0.32.

Wait, let me compute 0.32^2=0.1024. 0.322^2= (0.32 +0.002)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2 *0.32 *0.002 + (0.002)^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004= 0.103684.

Ah, so 0.322^2 = ~0.103684, which is a bit larger than our A of 0.10355. So the square root would be about 0.322. Hmm, but our A is ~0.10355, which is a bit less than 0.103684.

So R_p / R_s ≈ 0.322.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, and option A is ~0.39, which is higher. So the closest option is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap:

The amplitude from the spots is 10.355% (approx 0.10355). The planet's transit amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.10355. So R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322.

So the exoplanet's radius is about 32% of the star's radius. Looking at the options, D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, which is R_sun.

But the exoplanet's radius would be R_p = (0.322) R_sun. So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated the amplitude, I had:

A = (L_max - L_min)/ L_max.

L_max is when the front is unspotted, so 2π R² σ (6000^4) (front) + 2π R² σ (6000^4) (back) = 4π R² σ (6000^4) = L0.

But wait, no. The observed flux when the front is unspotted is just the front's contribution, because the back is not visible. So when the front is unspotted, the observed brightness is 2π R² σ (6000^4) (front) + 2π R² σ (6000^4) (back), but no, wait, the back is not visible. So when the front is unspotted, the observed flux is only the front's 2π R² σ (6000^4). Because the star is a sphere, and when the front is unspotted, the back is spotted, but we can't see it.

Wait, that's an important point. So when the front is unspotted, the front emits 2π R² σ (6000^4), and the back's emission doesn't contribute to our observation because it's on the other side. But when the front is spotted, the front emits [0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000^4)]. The back is unspotted but not visible.

Wait, that changes everything. So in this case, the maximum observed brightness is when the unspotted part is on the front: L_max = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

The minimum observed brightness is when the spotted part is on the front: L_min = [0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000^4)].

So the amplitude is (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

Compute this:

A = [2π R² σ (6000^4) - (0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000^4)) ] / [ 2π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify numerator:

= 2π R² σ (6000^4) [ 1 - 0.8 - 0.2*(5000^4/6000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ (6000^4) [ 0.2 - 0.2*(5/6)^4 ]

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So numerator becomes:

2π R² σ (6000^4) [0.2 - 0.2 * 0.48225 ] = 2π R² σ (6000^4) * 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225 )

= 2π R² σ (6000^4) * 0.2 * 0.51775.

= 0.2071 π R² σ (6000^4).

Denominator is 2π R² σ (6000^4).

So A = 0.2071 π R² σ (6000^4) / 2π R² σ (6000^4) = 0.2071 / 2 = 0.10355.

So the same as before, A ≈ 0.10355.

Thus, the planet's transit amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.10355, so R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322. So the exoplanet's radius is about 0.32 times the star's radius.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, so the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information and Setup:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 20\% \).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness varies as the spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of view.
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in brightness between the maximum (unspotted hemisphere) and minimum (spotted hemisphere) states.

3. **Planet Transit Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).

### Calculation of Brightness Variation Due to Spots:
1. **Maximum Brightness (\( L_{\text{max}} \))**:
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the brightness is:
     \[
     L_{\text{max}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]

2. **Minimum Brightness (\( L_{\text{min}} \))**:
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the brightness is:
     \[
     L_{\text{min}} = \left[ 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4 \right]
     \]

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation (\( A \))**:
   - The amplitude is the fractional change in brightness:
     \[
     A = \frac{L_{\text{max}} - L_{\text{min}}}{L_{\text{max}}}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( L_{\text{max}} \) and \( L_{\text{min}} \):
     \[
     A = \frac{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 - \left[ 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4 \right]}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     A = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225
     \]
   - Substitute:
     \[
     A = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 \right] = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.09645 \right] = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355
     \]
   - Thus, the amplitude \( A \approx 0.10355 \) or \( 10.355\% \).

### Equating to Planet Transit Amplitude:
1. The amplitude of the planet transit is:
   \[
   A_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
   \]
2. Set \( A_{\text{planet}} = A \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
   \]
3. Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
   \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). Comparing to the options, the closest match is:
