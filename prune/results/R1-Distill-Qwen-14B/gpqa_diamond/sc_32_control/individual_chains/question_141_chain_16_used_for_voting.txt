Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let me read it again: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?

Hmm, wait, I'm not sure what 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo. Oh, right! I think 1-bromo-2-d is probably 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene or something similar. Wait, no, wait, benzene rings have substituents. Oh wait, maybe the formula is written as C6H5Br or something else. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the "2-d" is a typo, and it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's a different substituent. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromobenzene with a methyl group at the para position. Wait, no, 1 and 2 would be adjacent on a benzene ring.

Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichloro? No, I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the reaction instead.

The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Oh right, that's a strong base, typically used for elimination reactions or for dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but more specifically, NaNH2 in ammonia is often used for dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, especially in aromatic substitution where elimination can occur.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromomethylbenzene. Or maybe 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene. Wait, no, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene, but perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism. So, when a benzene ring has substituents and there's a leaving group, like bromide, and we treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, the reaction would likely be an elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but benzene is already a ring, so how would elimination occur? Oh wait, I think in this context, the molecule might not be benzene but something else. Wait, perhaps the molecule is a substituted toluene or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene. Wait, no, perhaps it's a benzyl bromide structure, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reaction: NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. So, if the starting material is a bromide attached to a benzene ring with some substituents, perhaps it's undergoing elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond.

Wait, but benzene is already an aromatic ring. Oh! Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't benzene but a substituted cyclohexane or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzyl bromide where the bromide is on a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is bromobenzene with another substituent. Let me think: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Or maybe 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene. Wait, I'm not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having a substituent that can undergo elimination.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine and another substituent that can deprotonate and form a double bond. For example, say the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromo toluene. But how would that react with NaNH2?

Wait, perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction. So, the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. So, for example, if the structure is benzyl bromide, like CH2Br attached to benzene, then treatment with a strong base would eliminate HBr and form a styrene-type structure. But in that case, the product would be a double bond between the benzene and the CH2 group.

But wait, the starting material here is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that elimination leads to more than one possible product. For example, if there are two beta hydrogens available, elimination could lead to two different alkenes.

Wait, but let's think about the structure again. Suppose the molecule is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the bromine is at position 1, and there are methyl groups at 2 and 4. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the 2 or the 4 position, but wait, those are already methyl groups.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that can lose a proton. Maybe it's a bromide attached to a benzene ring with an adjacent hydrogen that can be abstracted. So, for example, if the structure is bromobenzene with a hydrogen adjacent, like in toluene, where the methyl group is next to the bromine.

So, in that case, elimination would form a double bond between the carbon where the methyl is and the bromine's carbon. Wait, but in benzene, each carbon is bonded to another, so the structure would have to have a substituent that's a CH2 group, for example.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like benzyl bromide: benzene-CH2-Br. If that's the case, then NaNH2 would deprotonate the CH2 group, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond between the benzene and the CH2 group, resulting in styrene (vinyl benzene).

But wait, in benzyl bromide, the structure is benzene-CH2-Br. When you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, you get elimination, forming benzene-CH2- which would abstract a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product would be benzene-CH2 becomes benzene-CH2- → benzene-CH2- losing H+ and Br-, so forming benzene-CH2- → wait, no. Wait, the mechanism would be: base abstracts a hydrogen from the CH2Br, leading to a carbanion intermediate which then loses Br- to form a double bond.

So, benzyl bromide would form styrene (C6H5-CH2Br → C6H5-CH2- → base → C6H5-CH-Br → but wait, no, wait, the base removes a beta hydrogen adjacent to Br. So in benzyl bromide, the CH2Br has two hydrogens on the adjacent carbon. So, the base (NH2^-) abstracts a hydrogen from the CH2Br, generating a carbanion, which then eliminates Br^- to form a double bond. So, the product would be C6H5-CH2Br → C6H5-CH^- Br → then lose Br^- and form a double bond, so C6H5-CH2 → becomes C6H5-CH2 → no, wait, that's not right. Wait, benzyl bromide is C6H5CH2Br. When NaNH2 is added, the base abstracts a hydrogen from CH2Br, making it CHBr^- with a negative charge. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between the benzene carbon and the adjacent carbon. So, the product is C6H5CH2Br → C6H5-CH2Br → after elimination, becomes C6H5-CH2 → no, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure. Let me think again. Benzyl bromide is C6H5-CH2Br. The base (ammonia's deprotonating) would abstract a hydrogen from the CH2Br group, leading to a carbanion. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond is formed between the benzene and the adjacent carbon. So the product would be C6H5-CH2Br → C6H5-CH^- Br → then elimination leads to C6H5-CH2 → wait, no. Wait, when the Br leaves, the adjacent carbon (from CH2Br) would form a double bond with the benzene ring. So the product would be C6H5-CH2Br → after elimination, becomes C6H5-CH2 → no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that allows for elimination. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2Br group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bromide attached to a carbon that is adjacent to another carbon with H's.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product possibilities. The question is how many products are formed. If the starting material has a single substituent that allows only one elimination, then only one product would form. But if there are multiple positions where elimination can occur, leading to different alkenes, then multiple products would be possible.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is a bromine attached to a benzene ring, and the ring has substituents that can lead to different positions for the elimination. For example, if the ring has substituents in such a way that the elimination can occur in different positions relative to the substituents, leading to different isomers.

Wait, for example, suppose the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, when elimination occurs, the hydrogen that is abstracted could be from either the 2 or 4 position, leading to different alkenes. But wait, in that case, the elimination would form a double bond between the carbon where the Br was and the adjacent carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-3-methylbenzene. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group's adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond in different positions.

Wait, but in aromatic systems, elimination typically leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else, like a substitution.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. For example, if the starting material is benzyl bromide, the product would be styrene. But if the starting material has multiple positions where elimination can occur, leading to different alkenes, then multiple products would form.

Wait, so if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the 2- or 4-methyl group, leading to elimination and forming a double bond in different positions. But wait, would that be possible?

Wait, for example, in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the Br is at position 1. So, the adjacent carbons are at positions 2 and 6. If the 2 position has a methyl group, then the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. Similarly, if there's a substituent at position 4, which is meta to the Br, perhaps the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 4, leading to a double bond between C1 and C4? No, wait, that's not adjacent. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So, the Br is at position 1, and a methyl group is at position 2. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group at position 2, leading to elimination of HBr and a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be 1,2-doubly bonded benzene, which would be a cyclohexadiene? No, wait, benzene is already a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. So, perhaps the product is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine and a substituent in a position that allows for the formation of different alkenes upon elimination. For example, if the substituent is in such a way that two different alkenes can form, then two products would be possible. Alternatively, more than two.

Wait, but the problem states that the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. I'm possibly getting stuck on the structure, which is important for solving the problem. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Then, when treated with a strong base, elimination of HCl and Br- could form a double bond, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,6-dichlorobenzene.

Wait, another angle: the number of possible products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because of different possible elimination paths.

Wait, another thought: The molecule might have a bromine on a carbon that is adjacent to another carbon with two or more hydrogens. For example, if the structure is CH2Br attached to a benzene ring, then elimination would form a double bond. But if the CH2Br is part of a longer chain, then elimination could lead to different alkenes based on where the H is abstracted.

Wait, another possibility: The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromide and another substituent that can undergo elimination in two different ways. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2Br group, elimination could form different alkenes depending on which hydrogen is abstracted.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the 2 or 3 position, leading to different elimination products. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination would form a single product because of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are symmetrically placed, leading to only one possible elimination product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-dichloride (but I'm not sure about that). Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. In this case, the bromide is at position 1, and methyl groups are at 2 and 4. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the 2 or 4 methyl group, leading to two possible elimination products. So, two products would form, each with a double bond in different positions.

Wait, but in this scenario, would the elimination lead to different structures? For example, if the methyl group is at 2, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. Similarly, if the methyl is at 4, would elimination form a double bond between 1 and 4? But wait, the positions on the benzene ring are such that 1 and 4 are across from each other, so forming a double bond between them might not be feasible in a single step.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the reaction. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, so the reaction is likely an elimination. If the starting material is a benzyl bromide (like benzene-CH2-Br), the product would be styrene (benzene-CH2-CH2 → no, wait, elimination would form a double bond, so benzene-CH2-Br → benzene-CH2 → but I'm not getting that right. Wait, perhaps it's benzene-CH2-Br → upon elimination, becomes benzene-CH2-CH2 → no, wait, no, elimination would form a double bond between the benzene's carbon and the adjacent CH2 group. So the product would be benzene-CH2Br → benzene-CH2-CH2 → no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a CH2CH2Br substituent. Then, elimination could lead to forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups, resulting in a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the starting material is 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the 2 or 6 position, leading to two different elimination products. So, two products would form, making the answer option C) 2.

But I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either 2,4, or 6 positions, but due to symmetry, some of these eliminations would lead to the same product.

Wait, for example, if the substituents are symmetrically placed at 2,4,6 positions, then elimination from any of those positions would lead to the same product, so only one product would form. That would make option B) 1 the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think about the number of possible products when a benzyl bromide undergoes elimination. If the substituents lead to only one possible position for elimination, then only one product. If multiple positions are possible, then multiple products.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, Br is at position 1, methyl groups at 2 and 4. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group at 2 or 4. Elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 4. But in benzene, the positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other, so forming a double bond between them might not be possible in a single step. Alternatively, maybe the double bond forms in such a way that the substituents are in certain positions, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a single product because the substituents are symmetric.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 4, 1, 2, or 3 possible products.

If the reaction leads to only one product because the substituents are symmetrically arranged and can't form different products, then the answer is B)1. If there are two substituents leading to two products, then C)2.

Wait, another angle: The molecule might have multiple β hydrogens, leading to multiple products. For example, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the 2 or 6 methyl group, leading to two different alkenes (1,2 and 1,6 double bonds). But wait, benzene is a ring, so 1,6 is the same as 1,2 in a different numbering.

Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 1 and 6 are also adjacent. So, in 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either 2 or 6, leading to two different elimination products. Wait, but in such a symmetric structure, would the products be the same? Because the molecule is symmetric, so eliminating from position 2 or 6 would give the same product. So in that case, only one product would form.

Wait, so perhaps the starting material is symmetric, leading to only one product. So the answer would be B)1.

But I'm still not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is such that elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to two products. So the answer would be C)2.

Wait, another possibility: The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, elimination could occur at position 2 or 4. But since 2 and 4 are meta to each other, would the products be different? If the substituents are in the 2 and 4 positions, then elimination from either would lead to different double bond positions, hence two products.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material only allows one possible elimination pathway, leading to a single product.

Wait, but the question is about how many products are formed. If the reaction leads to only one product, the answer is 1. If two, then 2. So I need to figure out how many possible structures can form.

Another thought: Maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But in that case, the product would be 1,2-diphenylethane? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between the adjacent carbons.

Wait, but benzene is an aromatic ring; elimination would convert a single bond into a double bond, but that's part of the ring structure. So perhaps in this case, the product is a diene, but that's not possible because benzene already has conjugated double bonds.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. For example, benzyl bromide treated with NaNH2 in ammonia would eliminate HBr and form styrene (vinylbenzene). So, if the starting material is benzyl bromide, the product is a single product, so the answer would be 1.

But in this problem, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. If that structure is such that elimination leads to only one product, then the answer is B)1. If it can lead to two products, then C)2.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is such that elimination can occur in two different positions, leading to two products. For example, if the substituents are at positions that allow for different elimination pathways.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. Then, elimination could occur from any of the three methyl groups, but due to symmetry, all eliminations would lead to the same product. So the answer would be 1.

Alternatively, if the substituents are at 2 and 4, but not 6, then elimination from 2 and 4 would lead to different products, hence two products.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should think that the reaction leads to only one product, making the answer B)1. Because if the substituents are symmetric, the product would be a single one.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene, which upon elimination would form a single product.

I'm really not sure, but based on the options, I think the correct answer is either 1 or 2. Given that, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is such that only one product is possible. So the answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The key is to determine the structure of the starting material and the possible products formed through elimination.

The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, is likely a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and another substituent at position 2. The exact nature of the substituent at position 2 is unclear, but it is assumed to be a group that can participate in elimination. NaNH₂ is a strong base, typically used for dehydrohalogenation, where it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond.

If the substituent at position 2 is such that elimination can occur in only one way, the reaction will yield a single product. For example, if the substituent is symmetric or if the elimination pathway is uniquely determined by the structure, only one product will form. On the other hand, if there are multiple β-hydrogens available at different positions, leading to distinct elimination products, multiple products could form.

Given the options (1, 2, 3, or 4 products), the analysis suggests that the starting material is likely symmetric or constrained in such a way that only one elimination pathway is possible. This would result in a single product. Therefore, the reaction produces only one organic product.

Answer: B
