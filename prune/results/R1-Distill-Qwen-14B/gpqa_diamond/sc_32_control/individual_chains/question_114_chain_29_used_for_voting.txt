Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let's take it step by step. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, there's a substitution reaction. Oh wait, the nucleophilic substitution maybe? Or wait, but ketones aren't typically involved in SN2 reactions because of their structure. Oh wait, maybe it's an addition reaction. Oh right! The formation of cyanohydrins. 

Wait, but in that case, the reaction is between a ketone and a nitrile under acidic conditions. The general reaction is ketone + CN^- → cyanohydrin. So butan-2-one has a carbonyl group. When it reacts with NaCN (which provides CN-), under acidic conditions (like H3O+), it would form a cyanohydrin. So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group both attached to the same carbon.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So in the reaction, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by OH and CN groups on the same carbon. That makes sense because under acidic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then the CN- attacks, forming the cyanohydrin.

So for the first part, Reagent A must be H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst used in the formation of cyanohydrins. So A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is turning into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

How does that happen? I think it involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile. There are different conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. The typical way to get a carboxylic acid is to hydrolyze the nitrile under acidic conditions, like with H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid) and heat, or using something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: Nitriles can be hydrolyzed in two steps. First to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under strong acidic conditions, maybe it goes directly. But the reagent here is H2O and B. Oh wait, the reagent B is probably the acid catalyst because without it, the hydrolysis might not proceed efficiently.

Wait, but the options for B are HCl and CH3COOH. So maybe B is an acid. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions. So when a nitrile is treated with water and acid, it can form a carboxylic acid, but I think that usually requires more vigorous conditions. Alternatively, if B is a strong acid like HCl, that might be the case.

Wait, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, which is the same as HCl (since H3O+ is from strong acids like HCl) in terms of providing H+ and Cl-? But wait, H3O+ is just the protonated water, which is a different setup. 

Looking at the options, for the second part, the reagent B is H2O and the option gives B = HCl or B = CH3COOH. Oh wait, perhaps in the second reaction, reagent B is the acid. Because for the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, acidic conditions are needed. So, the reagent B is likely HCl or another strong acid.

Wait, but the reaction is written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product. So B is the reagent added besides water. So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed with HCl as the acid catalyst. Alternatively, if B is Acetic acid (CH3COOH), that's a weak acid. But for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, strong acid conditions are usually needed, like H2SO4 or HCl. 

Wait, but the second part's product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile is converted into a COOH group. Another way: perhaps using a strong oxidizing agent. But in this case, the reagent is B along with H2O. So maybe it's a hydrolysis. 

So, for the second reaction, the conditions needed are aqueous acid. So reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options for B, option A says B=HCl, option C says B=HCl as well. So, in the first part, if A is H3O+ (so option A and B have A=H3O+), and in the second part, B=HCl, then the correct options would be either A or C. 

Wait, let me clarify: in the first reaction, Reagent A is H3O+, so that's either option A or B. Then, Reagent B is HCl, so options A and C have B=HCl and B=CH3COOH, respectively. So if B is HCl, the correct second part is option A or C. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B=HCl

So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, it's either option A or B. But the first reaction uses NaCN and H3O+ as the reagents. So that would make option A and B possible.

But wait, let me think again about the second reaction. Maybe the nitrile is hydrolyzed under different conditions. Another possibility is that the nitrile is treated with water and HCl as a catalyst. So the nitrile (-CN) would convert to -COOH. So the reagent B is HCl. So in the options, for the second part, B must be HCl, which is options A and C.

Wait, but the first reaction requires A to be H3O+, which is in options A and B. So if the first part uses A=H3O+, and the second part uses B=HCl, then the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me think: in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ gives the cyanohydrin. That's correct.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group in the cyanohydrin is being hydrolyzed. So the nitrile (-CN) becomes a -COOH group. That's a hydrolysis reaction. To do that, the typical conditions are strong acid (like H2SO4) and heat, or perhaps using an acid catalyst with water. So if the reagent is HCl, which is a strong acid, that would make sense.

So putting it all together:

First reaction: A is H3O+ (so options A and B are possible)
Second reaction: B is HCl (so options A and C are possible)

The only option that has A=H3O+ and B=HCl is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A= H3O+, B=CH3COOH

C) A= NaHSO3, B= HCl

D) A= NaHSO3, B= CH3COOH

So if the first reaction uses H3O+ (A) and the second uses HCl (B), the correct option is A.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN and H3O+ gives the cyanohydrin. That's right.

So the answer should be option A.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires acidic conditions, typically provided by H₃O⁺, to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, and facilitate the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation typically requires acidic conditions, and HCl is a suitable reagent for this purpose. Thus, reagent B must be HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is not strong enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. A (NaHSO₃) is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

The correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
