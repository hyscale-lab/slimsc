Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, wait, wait. Oh right, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So they should all react completely.

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. That might complicate things a bit.

Let me think about the reactions. First, I should find out how much H+ and OH- ions are present from each solution. Then, see which one is in excess because the neutralization will depend on the limiting reagent.

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate moles of HCl:
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole gives one H+.
Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

2. Calculate moles of H2SO4:
H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In solution, it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.
So each mole gives 2 H+.
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Calculate moles of Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- per formula unit.
Each mole gives 2 OH-.
Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. The other way around: when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base. The acid and base both contribute to the neutralization.

So total H+ from acids: HCl and H2SO4.
HCl gives 0.1 H+.
H2SO4 gives 0.18 H+.
Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The OH- is less, so it's the limiting reagent. The H+ in excess would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

But wait, how does that affect the neutralization reaction? The neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- produces water. Only the limiting reagent (OH-) will completely react.

So, the moles of H+ that react are 0.2 (same as moles of OH-). The remaining 0.08 moles of H+ will stay in solution, but for the purpose of calculating enthalpy, only the neutralization matters.

Each neutralization reaction releases heat. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), assuming strong acid and strong base. Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing the units here. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for HCl is about -57 kJ per mole. For H2SO4, since it's diprotic, each mole releases about 114 kJ (since 2 H+ are neutralized), but wait, no. Wait, wait, actually, the neutralization of sulfuric acid with a base would involve two H+ per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+ which react with OH-.

So the total heat released would be the sum of the heat from each H+ neutralizing. So the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2 (from OH-). So how much H+ comes from each acid?

HCl contributes 0.1 moles H+, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles H+. But only 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized because that's all the OH- available.

So the H+ that come from HCl and H2SO4 that are neutralized are:

HCl: 0.1 moles H+ → all of them are neutralized, since OH- is 0.2, which is more than 0.1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, HCl contributes 0.1 H+, H2SO4 0.18. So the H+ from both is 0.28. The OH- is 0.2, so the OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+.

So which H+ is neutralized? It depends on the reaction. The H+ from both acids will react with OH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the H+ available and the OH- available. The OH- can neutralize up to 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the total H+ available is 0.28, but only 0.2 reacts. So the amount of acid that's neutralized is 0.2 H+.

But wait, each H+ comes from either HCl or H2SO4. So HCl contributes 0.1, so all of that is neutralized. Then, the remaining 0.1 of the OH- (0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1) can neutralize H+ from H2SO4.

So H2SO4 contributes 0.18 H+, of which 0.1 are neutralized, and 0.08 remain.

Now, the enthalpy change comes from the neutralization of H+ with OH-. Each H+ from HCl contributes -57 kJ/mol when neutralized. Each H+ from H2SO4 contributes -57 kJ/mol as well. Wait, but wait, is it the same for both?

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is the energy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. The value is approximately -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases, as in the case here.

So, the total enthalpy change is the sum of each H+ that reacts times -57 kJ/mol.

So, the H+ that react is 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait, the H+ from HCl is 0.1, which all react. The OH- is 0.2, which can neutralize 0.1 from HCl and 0.1 from H2SO4.

So, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2.

So each H+ gives -57 kJ. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait, let me check the units. The options are in kcal and kJ. So 11.4 kJ would be -11.4 kJ, which is option B.

But wait, I thought the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait, 0.2 *57 = 11.4. So 11.4 kJ is -11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, but option B is -11.42 kcal. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given in kJ/mol, but sometimes in kcal/mol. So maybe 57 kJ/mol is equivalent to how many kcal?

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.62 kcal. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically about -57 kJ/mol, which is about -13.62 kcal/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate: 57 kJ is 57,000 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57000 /4184 ≈ 13.62 kcal. So each mole of H+ gives about -13.62 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * (-13.62) = -2.724 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

Wait, but wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Hmm, so I'm a bit confused now. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I got the conversion wrong. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is commonly around -57 kJ per mole of acid (for monoprotic strong acids like HCl). Since each mole of HCl releases one mole of H+, so each mole releases 57 kJ. So per mole of H+, it's 57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ, which is approximately 11.4 kJ. That's about -11.4 kJ, which would be option D, but wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of H+ and OH- in the reaction. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which H+ are being neutralized.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the enthalpy is per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in terms of the reaction between the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, but in any case, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles, each releasing 57 kJ, so total is -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem in terms of the limiting reagent.

Let me re-calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ available: 0.28.

Available OH-: 0.2.

So, OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Which H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4?

HCl has 0.1 H+, so all of that reacts. Then, the remaining 0.1 OH- (0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1) will react with H2SO4's H+.

H2SO4 has 0.18 H+, so 0.1 of them react, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

So, the total H+ neutralized is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2 moles.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ (assuming strong acid and strong base).

So total enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. Since it's exothermic, the enthalpy is negative: -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing kcal and kJ.

Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So, 11.4 kJ is about 2.724 kcal (because 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72). So, 11.4 kJ is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So that would correspond to option A.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 11.4 kJ to kcal accurately.

Since 1 kcal = 4184 J, and 1 kJ = 1000 J.

So, 11.4 kJ = 11400 J.

To convert to kcal: 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.722 kcal.

So, the enthalpy is -2.722 kcal, which rounds to -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the answer would be option D in kJ, but wait, perhaps the options are in different units.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, the correct answer would be either A or B in kcal, or D in kJ.

But wait, in my calculation, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

So that means option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches the 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but why is there an option B as -11.42 kcal? Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So that can't be. So option B is much larger, which is 11.42 kcal, which is about 48 kJ. That's way more than our 11.4 kJ.

So, the correct answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the standard enthalpy per mole of H+ is about 57 kJ, so 0.2 moles would be 11.4 kJ, which is option D. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equivalents.

The equivalents of H+ from each acid:

HCl: 0.1 moles, each gives 1 equivalent.

H2SO4: 0.18 moles H+, each is 1 equivalent.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles OH-, each is 1 equivalent.

So, the equivalents of acid = 0.28, base = 0.2.

The neutralization reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So each equivalent of H+ and OH- produces 1 equivalent of H2O, releasing 57 kJ per mole H+.

So the limiting reagent is OH- with 0.2 equivalents. So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have 11.4 kJ; option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the total H+ from H2SO4 as two equivalents, but that's already accounted for in the H+ calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy is per mole of H2O formed. Wait, but each mole of H+ produces one mole of H2O, so the total is 0.2.

Hmm, but then why is the option D -16.0 kJ?

Wait, maybe I should consider that H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole releases two H+. But in the case where OH- is limiting, it only neutralizes part of the H+ from H2SO4.

But no, that's already considered in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the neutralization isn't just for the H+ and OH- but for the entire reaction.

Wait, perhaps the balanced equation is needed.

Let me write the reactions.

HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, maybe I should consider the stoichiometry in terms of moles of acid and base.

Let me think about the moles of each.

Moles of HCl: 0.1.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

Each mole of HCl provides 1 H+ and each of H2SO4 provides 2 H+.

So, the total H+ is 0.1 + (0.09 * 2) = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 OH-.

So, the reaction between H+ and OH-:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

Each mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ, so 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. So, the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. So maybe the units are in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But why is option B at -11.42 kcal? That would be if the calculation was done in kJ and then converted directly without considering the units. For example, 11.4 kJ is 11.4 kJ, but if you thought it was -11.4 kcal, that would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step when determining the moles.

Wait, let's double-check the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → correct. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+ → correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → correct. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol → correct.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2 → correct.

So, the neutralization is 0.2 H+ → correct.

So 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → correct.

So converting 11.4 kJ to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So the answer is -2.72 kcal → option A.

Wait, but some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is different because it's diprotic. So maybe each mole of H+ from H2SO4 releases 57 kJ, same as HCl.

So, the initial approach is correct.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to give 2 moles of OH⁻, so total \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent because it is present in fewer moles.

3. **Calculate the moles of H⁺ neutralized:**
   - All 0.2 moles of OH⁻ will react with 0.2 moles of H⁺.  
   - The remaining \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) will remain unreacted.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of H⁺ is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - For 0.2 moles of H⁺ neutralized:  
     \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert units if necessary:**
   - To express the result in kcal:  
     \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so  
     \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the conversion from kJ to kcal.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not align with the calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

**Final Answer:** The correct enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
