Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The task is to find out which energy difference between them allows them to be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime (or the time) of a state. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, if the lifetime is the time uncertainty Δt, then the energy uncertainty ΔE would be roughly ħ divided by (2Δt).

So, the idea is that for two states to be distinguishable, their energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy. If the energy difference is much bigger, then we can clearly tell them apart. So, the minimum energy difference needed is about ħ/(2Δt), where Δt is the average of the two lifetimes, or perhaps the smaller one because if one has a shorter lifetime, the uncertainty is higher.

Wait, but the problem gives each state its own lifetime. How do I handle that? Maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty for each state. Or perhaps it's the lifetime of the state, because each has its own lifetime and energy uncertainty. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the time it takes for the system to transition between states is related. Oh wait, no, the lifetimes given are probably the mean lifetimes of each state before decay, but I'm not entirely sure how that factors into the problem.

Wait, the question is about resolving the energy levels. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart—they'd appear as a single peak or something.

So for the two states, each has their own uncertainty. Let's compute the uncertainty for each.

First, for E1, Δt is 1e-9 seconds. ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = approximately 5.25e-26 J. Hmm, but we need to convert that into eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 5.25e-26 J divided by 1.6e-19 J/eV is roughly (5.25e-26)/(1.6e-19) ) = approx 3.28e-7 eV. So that's about 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt is 1e-8 seconds. So ΔE2 = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-8) )= 1.05e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.25e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.6e-19 = approx 3.28e-8 eV.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps each of them must be larger than the individual uncertainties? Hmm. Or maybe the energy difference needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if one uncertainty is bigger, that's the limiting factor.

Wait, the energy difference should be bigger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is bigger than both, you can clearly see it. Let me think: if the energy difference is bigger than the uncertainty of each state, then you can distinguish. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the uncertainty, then the lines don't overlap. So, for example, if the two states have energy levels E1 and E2, the separation between them should be larger than the uncertainty in either.

So what are the uncertainties for each state? As I calculated before, E1 has ΔE1 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV. E2 has ΔE2 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is from E1, about 3e-7 eV. Thus, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than 3e-7 eV to be clearly resolved.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C) 1e-4, D) 1e-8 eV.

Wait, so wait: option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3e-7. So that would be clearly resolvable. But option D is 1e-8, which is less than the uncertainty of E1's 3e-7. So that's not enough. Option A is 1e-9, even smaller. So for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, it needs to be larger than the larger uncertainty, which is 3e-7 eV. But none of the options have a value larger than that, except C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Let me recalculate the uncertainty for E1 again.

Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ) = approximately 5.27e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.60217663e-19 J. So:

5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx (5.27e-26) / (1.602e-19) ) = 

5.27 / 1.602 = approx 3.29, and 1e-26 / 1e-19 = 1e-7. So total is 3.29e-7 eV.

So, yes, E1's uncertainty is about 3.29e-7 eV.

E2's Δt is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / (2*1e-8) ) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.28e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 (ΔE) should be larger than this value.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → much smaller than 3.29e-7 eV. So not enough.

B) 1e-11 → way too small.

C)1e-4 eV → 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 → which is way larger than 3.29e-7. So this would be resolvable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 = 0.0329e-7 → which is about 3% of the uncertainty. So not enough.

So the only option that's larger than the uncertainty is option C.

Wait, but wait. The question says "clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So perhaps the energy difference needs to be much larger than the uncertainty, not just larger. Because if it's just barely larger, perhaps the lines would still overlap a bit.

But looking at the options, only option C is larger than 3.29e-7 eV. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8, which is way bigger.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which energy difference allows the two quantum states to be clearly resolved, we apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \(\Delta t\) is the lifetime of the state, and \(\Delta E\) is the corresponding energy uncertainty. For two states to be distinguishable, their energy difference must be larger than the energy uncertainty of each state. The energy uncertainty for each state is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
- For the first state with \(\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s}\):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.25 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.25 \times 10^{-26}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For the second state with \(\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s}\):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.25 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.25 \times 10^{-27}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the larger energy uncertainty, which is \(\Delta E_1 \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \(10^{-9} \, \text{eV}\)**  
  This is much smaller than \(3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\), so it is not sufficient.

- **Option B: \(10^{-11} \, \text{eV}\)**  
  This is also much smaller than \(3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\), so it is not sufficient.

- **Option C: \(10^{-4} \, \text{eV}\)**  
  This is significantly larger than \(3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\), so it is sufficient for resolution.

- **Option D: \(10^{-8} \, \text{eV}\)**  
  This is smaller than \(3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\), so it is not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that is larger than the energy uncertainty of the first state, ensuring clear resolution, is **Option C**.
