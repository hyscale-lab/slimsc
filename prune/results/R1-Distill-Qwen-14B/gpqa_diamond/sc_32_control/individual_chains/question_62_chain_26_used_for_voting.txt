Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, let me visualize what the target looks like. The main part is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a carbaldehyde group (so a CHO group) and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, so like, it's a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Oh wait, actually, the formula says (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), so the structure is CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl group, and that whole thing is attached to another cyclohexane ring which also has a CHO group. Hmm, maybe I should draw a rough structure.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. The triple bond is between two carbons, probably as CH2-C≡CH, but wait, ethynyl is CH2C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is the substituent where the triple bond is between C1 and C2, so it's -C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C- attached to something else, but the structure of ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. Or is it -CH2C≡CH? Oh, I think it's cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group. Because ethynyl is the substituent, so I think the structure is cyclohexane with a vinyl group where the triple bond is. So the starting material is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is probably a terminal alkyne.

Now, the goal is to create this target molecule. Let's think about what reactions can add groups to the triple bond. Terminal alkynes can undergo various reactions. For example, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, they can undergo deprotonation to form an alkyne anion, which can then react with electrophiles. Alternatively, they can undergo hydrogenation to alkenes or alkanes.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituent attached to the cyclohexane is a group that has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon. That suggests some kind of ring-opening or perhaps a substitution reaction where that carbon is involved.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the steps needed. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, and all of that is attached to another cyclohexane ring which also has a CHO group. So maybe the ethynylcyclohexane undergoes some reactions that add substituents and then perhaps a cycloaddition or some kind of ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or something else, then functionalized.

Wait, the target has a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group that's connected to a cyclohexane. So perhaps a Grignard or organometallic reagent is involved. Or maybe an epoxide opening or some kind of nucleophilic substitution.

Let me think about the options given. The options are four different sequences of reagents. Each option has several steps, so let's go through each step in each option and see which makes sense.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Maybe deprotonation of the triple bond to form an anion, which would then react with methyl chloride as an electrophile. So the triple bond would add a methyl group. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Deprotonating that would give a strong base, which would react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to give CH2-C≡C-Me. So the triple bond would become CH2-C≡C-Me attached to cyclohexane. Then, the next step is H2/Pd → hydrogenation. That would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So CH2-C≡C-Me becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with two Hs added. So the structure would become CH2-CH2-CH2-Me? But wait, that would be CH2CH2CH2Me? That doesn't make sense; perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-Me as in CH2CH2CH2CH3? Or wait, no, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. After adding methyl, it's CH2-C≡C-Me. Then hydrogenation would add Hs across triple bond, making it CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, that's CH2CH2CH2Me, which is propane-1-yl group? Hmmm.

But wait, following that, the third step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination? Or perhaps for epoxidation? Or maybe it's a Birch reduction? Not sure. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the oxidation conditions for a diol to form a ketone or something. Wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 with water is Jones' oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but wait, maybe it's more about epoxide opening or something else.

I'm not sure if this sequence would lead to the target. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached, which would require some kind of ring-forming step. Maybe not, perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → Deprotonate the alkyne to form an anion, react with ethyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-Et attached to cyclohexane. Then step 2 is Li/liq. NH3 → which is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation again or for elimination. Wait, but if the triple bond is already substituted, maybe it's for forming a Grignard or some organometallic reagent.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is used for deprotonating things to make organometallic reagents. Alternatively, maybe it's for elimination, like forming an alkyne again but in a different position?

Step 3 is O3, H2O. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond or triple bond. If the alkyne is treated with ozone, what happens? Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives diketones, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, if the alkyne is hydrogenated first, then ozonolysis would break a double bond. Wait, but step 2 here is Li in NH3. Maybe that's for deprotonating and then forming a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

After ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous workup, maybe to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing how this would lead to the target with a cyclohexyl group attached.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → same as before, adding methyl group to the triple bond. So ethynyl becomes CH2-C≡C-Me attached.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Oh, that's a hydrogenation catalyst. So the triple bond would be hydrogenated to a single bond. So from CH2-C≡C-Me, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane. So CH2CH2CH2Me.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but after step 2, the triple bond is now a single bond, so perhaps the molecule has a single bond. Wait, after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two additional hydrogens. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2Me. Wait, but that's a single bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't act on that because it's single bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond was hydrogenated to a double bond. Oh wait, sometimes hydrogenation with H2 and certain catalysts can stop at the alkene if it's the right conditions. But no, the catalyst here is Pd with CaCO3, which is typically for full hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds. So after step 2, no double bond exists. Therefore, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → Hmm, so deprotonation of the ethynyl group to form an alkyne anion, which would react with methanol. But wait, methanol is CH3OH, so would it be an electrophilic substitution? Or would it be a nucleophilic attack?

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. In the presence of ethynylcyclohexane, it would deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide (or sodium, depending on the base). Then, adding methanol would probably lead to the alkyne anion reacting with the methyl group from methanol, but wait, methanol is CH3OH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, no, probably, the alkyne anion (a strong base) would react with an alkylating agent. Methanol, though, isn't a good electrophile for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a ketone via some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. So step 1 would deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane to form a sodium acetylide. Then, adding methanol would quench it, but perhaps the alkyne would be alkylated with methanol? But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne anion would attack a methyl group from methanol? But that seems unlikely. Hmm.

Step 2 is Li in liq. NH3 → which is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation again. Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous workup.

Wait, but if the first step is NaNH2 and methanol, perhaps it's a way to form a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and can induce elimination reactions, but with methanol maybe it's a substitution.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this from the target molecule. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a substituent which is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group in specific positions.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then undergoes some kind of addition or substitution. Let's think about the steps.

Another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is attached to another cyclohexane which has a CHO. So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to introduce both the cyclohexane ring and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So maybe the triple bond is used to add a methyl group (from methyl chloride) to form -C≡CMe. Then, hydrogenation to make -CH2-CH2-Me. Or maybe a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is used in a Grignard reaction. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone via some oxidation. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. Oxidizing the triple bond to a ketone would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Not exactly, because oxidation of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) can give R-C=O (a ketone if R is an alkyl group).

Wait, that's right. Oxidation of a terminal alkyne with a strong oxidizing agent like O3 followed by H2O and H+ can give a carboxylic acid. But in this case, perhaps the ethynyl group is oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So after oxidation of the triple bond, would it become a ketone group? Let me think: Ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH, where R is cyclohexyl. Oxidation would convert this to R-C=O, i.e., cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Wait, no, because the triple bond is R-C≡CH. Oxidation would require adding an oxygen. Hmm, perhaps it's R-C≡C-OH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the first step is deprotonation with a strong base like NaNH2, forming an acetylide. Then, perhaps the acetylide attacks an electrophilic reagent, like methyl chloride.

So, for option C, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which would add a methyl group to the acetylide. Then, step 2 is H2 with Pd-CaCO3, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. So after step 2, the ethynyl group would be hydrogenated to a single bond, turning into a CH2-CH2-CH2-Me group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but hydrogenation of a triple bond (sp-hybridized carbon) would typically add two Hs to each carbon, turning a triple bond into a single bond with two Hs added. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, with each carbon having two additional Hs. So the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to the cyclohexane. So that's a three-carbon chain, with the middle carbon attached to the cyclohexane.

Then, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into carbonyl groups. But wait, after step 2, the triple bond was hydrogenated to a single bond, so there's no double bond anymore. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything here. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond first. Wait, but the catalyst in step 2 is Pd with CaCO3, which is typically for full hydrogenation (triple to single). Unless conditions are adjusted to stop at the alkene. But I don't think that's the case here.

Another angle: the target has a hydroxyl group on a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps a Grignard reaction is involved, where the Grignard adds twice to a carbonyl group, creating a new carbon-carbon bond and then hydrolysis to form an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone. So if we oxidize the triple bond, we get a ketone. How would that happen?

Wait, another possible reaction is hydration of the alkyne. Using H2O and a catalyst like HgSO4 and H2SO4 (which is option A's step 4). So the triple bond becomes a ketone. For example, the triple bond would become a carbonyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, but how is that done? The mercury-based catalyst is used for the hydration of alkynes to ketones. So step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which I'm not sure about, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the typical conditions for hydration of a triple bond to a ketone.

Wait, let's think about the steps in option A again:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl to the triple bond, making CH2-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.
3. Ba(OH)2 → I'm not sure what this does. Maybe elimination? Or perhaps it's a base for another reaction.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of any triple bonds, but after step 2, there are no triple bonds left. So maybe step 3 is something else.

Hmm. Maybe the sequence in option C is better. Let's look at option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl to triple bond, forming CH2-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates triple bond to single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → but that's ozonolysis. But after step 2, the molecule has a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, not a single bond. So maybe step 2 is using a Lindlar catalyst, which would hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis double bond. But in option C, the catalyst is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is probably for full hydrogenation. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is not hydrogenated all the way. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring that has a CHO group.

If the ethynyl group is used to form a diene or a dienophile, perhaps via some addition reactions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has two cyclohexane rings. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which has one cyclohexane. So perhaps another cyclohexane is added via a ring-opening or some coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps a Grignard reagent is used to add a cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. The first step in each option is NaNH2 with some alkylating agent. So that's deprotonation to form an acetylide, followed by alkylation. For example, ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and methyl chloride would form a new alkyne with a methyl group added, CH2-C≡C-Me attached to cyclohexane.

Then, hydrogenation would add Hs across the triple bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to the cyclohexane.

But then what? The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps after hydrogenation, we have a longer chain, and then oxidation or some other functional group introduction.

Wait, the target also has a CHO group on the cyclohexane. So perhaps after some steps, a carbonyl group is introduced.

Another thought: The target has both a hydroxymethyl and a carbonyl group. Perhaps the triple bond is converted into two carbonyl groups. How? Ozonolysis of a triple bond would typically give two carbonyls, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, ozonolysis is usually for double bonds, but maybe under certain conditions it can act on triple bonds. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is first hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolyzed.

For example:

Step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and methyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-Me attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond with a specific catalyst (like Lindlar's for cis addition or Na/NH3 for trans). If step 2 is using H2 and a different catalyst, it could stop at the double bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, in option B, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Could that be for deprotonation again to form a stronger base, perhaps for elimination? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone first, then something else is added.

Wait, option D's step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, deprotonation forms the acetylide ion, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is CH3OH. Would the acetylide attack the methyl group, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond? That's possible. So the alkyne would become CH2-C-Me-OH attached? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe I should look for which option includes a step to introduce a hydroxyl group. The target has a hydroxymethyl group, so perhaps a hydroboration or some kind of epoxide opening.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding the methyl groups, an oxidation step would form the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add methyl group via alkylation (NaNH2 and methyl chloride).
2. Hydrogenate to single bond.
3. Ozonolysis to break into two carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps after adding a longer chain, we form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used in a cyclopropanation or some other ring-forming reaction.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps for each option and see which makes sense.

Option C:

Step 1: Add methyl to triple bond → CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Hydrogenate triple bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane.

Step 3: Ozonolysis. But with (CH3)2S as a reductant, which is a milder condition. Ozonolysis would need a double bond to act on. If step 2 leaves a double bond, then it would break. But in step 2, the triple is hydrogenated to a single bond, so no double bond. So this doesn't make sense. So maybe option C is incorrect.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → maybe forms a ketone via hydration? Or perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, which would deprotonate the ethynyl group to form an acetylide. Methanol has CH3OH. The acetylide (strong base) might abstract a proton from methanol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the acetylide might react with an electrophilic carbon, but methanol isn't an electrophilic source. Hmm, perhaps this step adds a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, if the acetylide (which is R-C≡C-) reacts with CH3OH, perhaps it would form R-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydration of the acetylide. But I don't recall that being a standard reaction.

After step 1, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an alcohol or something else. Not sure.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → very strong base. Maybe for elimination or forming a stronger organometallic.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Again, if the molecule has a double bond, it would break into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous workup.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Option B:

Step 1: Add ethyl group to alkyne → CH2-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → maybe forms a strong base, like a lithium acetylide, but with an ethyl group.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → which would break a double bond into carbonyls. But after step 1 and 2, the molecule may have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is for deprotonation and alkylation again.

Hmm, not sure.

Option A's steps:

1. Add methyl to alkyne → CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → not sure, maybe elimination to form a double bond? Or perhaps it's a base for epoxide opening, but I don't see an epoxide here.

4. Jones' oxidation → H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps the target has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached. So maybe the ethynyl group is used to form a benzyl-type structure, which can then undergo substitution or addition.

Another thought: The target has a structure where the substituent is cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl on the same carbon attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a cyclohexyl group via some ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a diene, which then undergoes a cycloaddition or some reaction to form a ring.

Hmm, I'm still stuck. Maybe I should think about the target's structure again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane with a CHO group and a substituent that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) attached to another carbon.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to add a cyclohexyl group via some alkyne chemistry. For example, if the triple bond is used in a coupling reaction, attaching a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, then undergoes a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexane ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a benzannulation product, adding a ring.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about each option's steps again.

Looking at option C again:

Step 1: Add methyl to alkyne → CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Hydrogenate to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ozonolysis. But after step 2, there's no double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't react. Perhaps this isn't correct.

Wait, unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation to a double bond. But with Pd-CaCO3, that's unlikely. I think Pd tends to fully hydrogenate triple bonds.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is followed by an oxidation step to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group. So perhaps a carbonyl group is formed from the alkyne. How? By hydration with HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O. That would convert the triple bond into a ketone.

So if we have ethynylcyclohexane, and we add a methyl group via NaNH2 and methyl chloride, making CH2-C≡C-Me attached to cyclohexane. Then, perform hydrogenation to make CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, perhaps an oxidation step to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but how? Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is not hydrogenated but oxidized.

Wait, maybe another approach. The target molecule has a structure where the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). This suggests that perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a benzyl-type group, which is then functionalized.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a benzyl ether or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of adding a hydroxyl group via epoxidation and then ring-opening, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (NaNH2, methyl chloride) → CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so no reaction. So perhaps this isn't the way.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. But in that case, the catalyst would need to be something like Lindlar's or Na/NH3 for trans addition. But in the options, I don't see such a step.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone via hydration. So if step 4 in option A is the hydration, perhaps that's the way.

Option A's steps:

1. Add methyl → CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

4. Jones' oxidation → oxidize to a ketone or carboxylic acid.

Wait, after step 2, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane. Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, forming a double bond. So step 3 could be dehydrohalogenation or elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but after step 2, we have a single bond, no halogens. So perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for epoxide formation, but I don't see an epoxide here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be for the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone, but I don't see an alcohol in the structure yet.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings, which we don't have here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol. Wait, but I don't see any diols here.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the correct steps another way.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl substituent and a CHO group.

So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to add a cyclohexyl group via a ring-opening or substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, which upon protonation gives the substituent.

But how?

Wait, another thought: The target has both a CHO and a CH(OH)Cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a diketone, which then undergoes some kind of aldol condensation or other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, then subjected to a nucleophilic attack to add a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane → after hydration becomes cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group attached to cyclohexane). Then, perhaps a Grignard adds to the aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, oxidation could form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps the Grignard adds twice to the aldehyde.

Wait, for example, the aldehyde could react with a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide), adding twice to form a tertiary alcohol. Then, upon oxidation, it might form a ketone, but that's not matching the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, then esterified or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is converted to a ketone via hydration (using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O).

2. The ketone undergoes a Grignard reaction with a cyclohexyl Grignard, adding to the carbonyl.

3. Workup gives a secondary alcohol.

4. Then, perhaps an oxidation or another reaction.

But the target has a CHO group and a hydroxymethyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then undergoes a Wittig reaction or something else.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which option's steps can produce the target.

Let me think about option D again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an acetylide and then reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether or something else.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → forms a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But again, I'm not sure. Maybe step 1 forms a ketone via some hydration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the target has both a carbonyl and an alcohol group, suggesting that the alkyne was converted into a ketone and then underwent some addition or substitution.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a benzyl-type group which is then functionalized.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a benzyl group via some reactions. Let me think.

After deprotonation and alkylation (step 1), the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation (step 2) converts it into CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, ozonolysis (step 3) would break a double bond into carbonyls, but without a double bond, this doesn't happen. So perhaps this isn't the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used in a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. So perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane adds another cyclohexyl group via a coupling reaction.

Wait, another idea: The triple bond could be used in a Sonogashira coupling to add a cyclohexyl group, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used in a C-H insertion reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, but the options don't include such reagents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target's structure again. The target has two cyclohexane rings. The starting material has one. So perhaps another cyclohexane is added via a substitution or addition reaction.

But I'm not seeing exactly how.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options given.

Given that the target has a hydroxymethyl group and a carbonyl group, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the triple bond, then performing ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and finally some oxidation or reduction.

Wait, looking at option C, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. If the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups. But after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond. So unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate, perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a different catalyst that stops at the double bond.

Wait, Pd with CaCO3 is a catalyst for full hydrogenation. Alternatively, if the catalyst were Raney nickel, perhaps it would stop at the double bond. But the options say Pd-calcium carbonate, so I think it goes to the single bond.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another angle.

The target has a cyclohexane with a substituent that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). So perhaps that substituent is formed via a substitution where the hydroxyl group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into an epoxide, which is then opened by a nucleophile.

But without an epoxide, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The target's substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). This could be formed via a Grignard reaction where a cyclohexyl group is added to a carbonyl, then the Grignard adds again, and upon protonation, you get a diol, which is then oxidized.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond → CH2-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis → but can't act on single bond. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used in a way that forms a ring. For example, a cyclopropane or some other ring structure.

But I'm not seeing it.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the options. The correct sequence likely involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then performing ozonolysis on a double bond (but I'm not sure how that's introduced). Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is for epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that can induce elimination reactions.

In option A, after step 2, the molecule has CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached. Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which could dehydrate the molecule to form a double bond. So perhaps it's an elimination step, forming a double bond. Then, step 4, which is Jones' oxidation, would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, but I don't see an alcohol here.

Alternatively, after elimination to form a double bond, Jones' oxidation would oxidize any alcohols to ketones or acids, but I'm not seeing an alcohol in the structure.

Hmm, perhaps after elimination, the double bond is in the chain, and then in step 4, H2SO4 and HgSO4 would hydrate the double bond to a ketone. But that's not the case in this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized.

But I'm not certain.

Given all this, I think the correct option is C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option D might involve forming the necessary groups.

Wait, in option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms a Grignard-like reagent, but methanol isn't a typical electrophile for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration step. If the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then step 2 could be deprotonation and alkylation.

But I'm not sure.

After struggling through this, I think the correct option is C. Because:

Step 1: Add methyl group via NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

Step 2: Hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis would work on a double bond, but how is the double bond formed? Unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate, perhaps stopping at the double bond. But I don't think so with Pd-CaCO3.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Another possibility is that after step 1, the triple bond is converted into a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I'll have to make a guess.

The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. The analysis of the options involves determining which sequence of reagents can achieve this transformation.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, resulting in CH₂-C≡C-Me attached to cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Me attached to cyclohexane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely acts as a strong base, possibly inducing elimination to form a double bond.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones' oxidation, which typically oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule, as the steps do not account for the introduction of the hydroxymethyl group or the cyclohexyl group.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and adds an ethyl group, forming CH₂-C≡C-Et attached to cyclohexane.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double or triple bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous workup.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group or the hydroxymethyl group is introduced, making it unlikely to produce the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and adds a methyl group, resulting in CH₂-C≡C-Me attached to cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Me attached to cyclohexane.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup. However, after step 2, the molecule has a single bond, so ozonolysis would not act on it.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely a base, but its role is unclear in this sequence.

This sequence does not provide a clear path to the target molecule, as ozonolysis cannot act on a single bond, and the steps do not account for the introduction of the hydroxymethyl or cyclohexyl groups.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group, and methanol may react to form a methyl ether or a hydroxyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup.
4. **NH₄OH**: Aqueous workup.

This sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group or the hydroxymethyl group is introduced, making it unlikely to produce the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary intermediates, even though the exact pathway is unclear.

Answer: C
