Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's read through the problem again to understand all the reactions and the information given. The problem goes like this:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E, with options given as A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, okay, so I think I need to figure out what compounds A, B, C, D, etc., are based on the reactions. Let's start by deducing the possible identities.

Starting with reaction 1: Solid A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and used in large amounts, maybe B is a halogen, like chlorine or fluorine? Because halogens are diatomic gases. Alternatively, maybe it's oxygen or another gas.

Product C is bright red. Bright red products make me think of certain compounds. For example, I know that when metals like copper react with chlorine, they form copper(II) chloride, which is greenish, but maybe something else. Wait, another bright red solid could be mercury(II) chloride, but that's more of a red powder. Or perhaps it's lead(II,IV) oxide, which is a red solid. Hmm, but lead isn't reacting here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is between a metal and a diatomic gas. Let's think. If A is a metal and B is Cl2, then reacting in 8 equivalents suggests a specific molar ratio. 8 is a big number, perhaps a 1:8 ratio? Like 1 mole of A reacting with 8 moles of B. So maybe A is a metal with a +1 charge? Because 1 mole of A would need 8 moles of B if each B contributes a -1 charge. Wait, no, Cl2 is diatomic so each molecule gives two Cl- ions. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sodium (Na), which is a solid, and B is chlorine gas (Cl2). If they react, sodium would react with Cl2 to form NaCl. But the molar ratio for Na and Cl2 is 2:1. Because 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of B, which would be Cl2. So 8 moles of Cl2 would require 16 moles of A if it's something with a +1 charge. Hmm, but that doesn't quite add up with the 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe A is copper. Copper can form CuCl. Let me think about the reaction. Copper metal (Cu) reacting with Cl2 gas. The reaction is 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl. That's a 2:1 ratio. So if in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of B, that would mean 8 moles of Cl2. So that would require 16 moles of Cu. So the molar ratio is 16 Cu : 8 Cl2 → 2:1. So that fits. So product C would be CuCl. But wait, CuCl is a white solid, not bright red.

Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal forming a colored product. Another possibility: maybe the product is lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another bright red product: perhaps it's mercury(I) chloride, Hg2Cl2. Wait, what's the reaction for that? Mercury metal reacts with chlorine: 2 Hg + Cl2 → 2 HgCl. But HgCl is a white solid. Hg2Cl2 is red, but that's when mercury(I) is formed. The reaction for that would be Hg + Cl2 → HgCl2 (mercurous chloride, which is red). Wait, but Hg is a liquid at room temperature. So maybe that's not solid A.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron. Iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, which is yellowish. Not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is not between a metal and a halogen. What else could be a solid reacting with a diatomic gas to form a bright red product? Perhaps a reaction involving sulfur? Sulfur is a solid, right? Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. Hmm, but SO2 is a gas, so maybe not.

Wait, another angle: the product C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So when C is treated with water, it breaks back into A and two acids. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, for example, if C is a metal chloride, when it reacts with water, it dissociates into metal hydroxide and HCl, but that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids.

Wait, wait, another possibility: C could be a metal sulfide. If C is a sulfide, like CuS, but when it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't form acids. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. So, for example, a salt like AlCl3 (aluminum chloride) reacts with water to form HCl (a strong acid) and H3AlO3 (which may not be stable, but as an example). Wait, but AlCl3 is a Lewis acid, reacts with water to form HCl and a complex ion. But I'm not sure if that produces two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride? For example, Mg3N2 reacting with water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3 (a weak acid, but NH3 is a base). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. What gas D could this be? Let me think: if B is Cl2 (a diatomic gas), then D might be another diatomic gas. The reaction of D and B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But if D and B are both diatomic gases, perhaps D is O2, but O2 + Cl2 don't really form a solvent. Hmm, maybe D is H2, but H2 and Cl2 react to form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2, but O2 and Cl2 don't form a solvent. Alternatively, when B is Cl2, perhaps D is another gas that reacts with Cl2 to form a solvent. Wait, H is a solvent. So what solvents are formed from reactions of diatomic gases? For example, H2O is a solvent, formed from H2 and O2. So if H is H2O, then D must be O2, and B is H2? Wait, but earlier, B is a diatomic gas that reacts with A. Let me think again.

Wait, let me structure this:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

So what if B is Cl2 and D is O2? Let me see.

But if B is Cl2 and D is O2, then D + B would react to form ClO2 or ClO, but that doesn't form a solvent.

Wait, another approach: H is a solvent formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio. If H is H2O, then D must be O2 and B must be H2. Because H2 + O2 → H2O. But then, what about reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with 8 H2 (gas) to form C (bright red). What solid reacts with H2 in large amounts to form a bright red product? Maybe a transition metal. For example, chromium or molybdenum. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. Another solvent is ethanol, but that's probably not formed from two diatomic gases. Maybe H is NH3? But NH3 is a gas, not a solvent in this context.

Wait, perhaps H is something else. Let me think about the reaction D + B → H. If H is a solvent, perhaps H is something like HCl? No, HCl is a gas. Oh wait, H could be something like DMSO (but that's a larger molecule, not from diatomic gases). Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, maybe B is O2. Then, what's D? So D + O2 → H (solvent). What solvent is produced when a gas reacts with O2? Maybe H is Ozone (O3), but that's a gas. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2. Then D could be O2, so H is H2O. So reaction 4: O2 + H2 → H2O (with a catalyst, perhaps). So if H is H2O, then product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of O2 (since D is O2). 

Now, let's go back to reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What solid reacts with H2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product? Maybe a metal that forms a +2 ion, requiring 8 H2 per A. For example, if A is Fe, then Fe + H2 → FeH2? But I don't think that's stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal.

Wait, another thought: if C is FeCl3, which is yellow, not bright red. Hmm. Maybe C is a sulfide? Let me think: If A is a metal and B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas). So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. So reaction 1 is A + 8 Cl2 → C.

If A is a metal, the reaction would be something like Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2. But the molar ratio is 1:1, but in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of Cl2, suggesting 8 moles. So if A is something that reacts 1:8 with Cl2, perhaps a +1 cation? Because 8 Cl- would come from 4 Cl2 molecules (since each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-). Wait, 8 Cl- would require 4 moles of Cl2. Because 4 Cl2 → 8 Cl-. So if A is a metal with a +2 charge, then 1 mole of A would require 2 moles of Cl2. Hmm, but the problem says 8 equivalents of B, which is Cl2. So 8 moles of Cl2 would mean 8 * 2 =16 Cl- ions. So if A is a metal with a +1 charge, 16 Cl- would come from 8 Cl2 (since each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-). So 16 Cl- → 8 Cl2. So 16 Cl- would require 16 A+ ions. So the molar ratio is A : Cl2 = 16 :8 → 2:1. So A is a +1 ion, and the product C is ACl.

But A is a solid, so ACl would be a solid. Hmm. But I'm not sure if that's leading me anywhere.

Alternatively, maybe A is Na (sodium), which reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. But the molar ratio in the reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So for 1 mole of Cl2, 2 moles of Na are used. So if in the problem, 8 moles of Cl2 are used, that would require 16 moles of Na, giving 16 moles of NaCl. So that's a possibility.

But NaCl is a white solid, not bright red. So perhaps the product C is something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a compound that can react with water to form a strong acid and a weak acid. Let's think about that.

If C reacts with water to give A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, for example, if C is AlCl3, then AlCl3 + H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3 HCl. HCl is a strong acid, but Al(OH)3 is an amphoteric hydroxide, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: what if C is a nitride? For example, NH4Cl (ammonium chloride) reacts with water to give NH4OH (which is NH3 and HCl). Wait, but that's not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is CuS, and upon hydrolysis, it gives H2S (a weak acid) and maybe a metal hydroxide. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) reacts with water to give NaOH (strong base, not acid), H2CO3 (weak acid). Hmm, but that's not two acids.

Wait, another angle: the two acids F and G are formed. If F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl and G is HNO2 or something. So C could be a nitro compound? Not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a metal chlorate, maybe it decomposes to form HClO (which is a weak acid) and HCl (strong). Wait, but I'm not certain.

Let me think about product E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D is likely a diatomic gas. Let's say B is Cl2, then D could be O2, as O2 is another diatomic gas.

So reaction 4: D (O2) + B (Cl2) → H (solvent). Hmm, but how would O2 and Cl2 form a solvent? Maybe under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is OCl (which isn't a solvent), or maybe it's HOCl, but that's a liquid perhaps at certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then reaction 4: H2 + O2 → H2O (with a catalyst, like in combustion). Then H is H2O, which is a solvent.

So if H is H2O, then D is O2 and B is H2.

Then, reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 H2 → C (bright red). So what solid reacts with hydrogen gas in an 8:1 molar ratio to produce a bright red product?

Wait, maybe A is a transition metal. For example, chromium or molybdenum. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is vanadium. Vanadium reacts with H2 under certain conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a sulfide. But if B is H2, then the reaction would be a metal + H2 → metal hydride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal that forms a chloride (if B is Cl2). Let me go back to that.

Assuming B is Cl2, D is O2, and H is H2O.

So reaction 1: A + 8 Cl2 → C.

If A is a metal, then C would be a metal chloride. Let's say A is Fe. Then Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3, which is yellow, not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is copper(II) chloride, but that's blue. Not red.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C contains sulfur. Like CuS? But CuS is a black solid.

Wait, another angle: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it forms A, F (strong), and G (weak). So perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a nitrite salt or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. When it reacts with water, it would break down into metal hydroxide and carbonic acid (which is weak). But then F would be hydroxide, which isn't an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). But that's not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. So F and G are both acids. Which suggests that C is an acidic salt, like a sulfite or something that can produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, for example, (NH4)2SO3 (ammonium sulfite) reacts with water to give NH4OH (which is NH3 and H2O, not an acid) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). Hmm, but that only gives one acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a polyprotic acid anhydride. For example, Na2Cr2O7 (sodium dichromate) reacts with water to form 2 NaOH (but that's a base) and H2Cr2O7 (which is a strong acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chlorate. For example, Al(ClO)3. When it reacts with water, it can form HClO (a weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). So Al(ClO)3 + H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3 HClO. Wait, but that's not exactly two acids. Maybe another example.

Wait, perhaps C is something like Ca(ClO)2. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form HClO (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the possible structure of E.

E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If D is O2, then C + O2 → E. So perhaps E is a compound containing O. But without knowing C, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if D is O2 and E is a hazardous product, perhaps E is a toxic oxide, like CO or something else.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the possible E structures and their symmetry.

The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are molecular symmetry groups. D4h and D∞h suggest high symmetry, like in tetrahedral or octahedral molecules. C2 is a two-fold rotation. C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

If E is a molecule with a certain geometry, like O=C=O (CO2), which has D∞h symmetry. But wait, CO2 is linear, D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, H2O has D2h symmetry but is bent, but that's not matching any options. Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Hmm, another example: Ozone (O3) has a bent structure with C2v symmetry. Because it has a central O with two O's attached, one on each side, making a bent structure with a mirror plane and a two-fold rotation axis.

Wait, so if E is O3, then its symmetry group is C2v. Looking at the options, option D is C2v.

But why would E be O3? Let's see.

If C reacts with O2 to form O3, perhaps. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps C is a metal chloride, which when reacted with O2 gives a metal oxide. But that's not likely to be a hazardous product unless it's something like lead oxide.

Alternatively, E could be a chlorine-containing compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back. If D is O2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 O2 → E. What kind of reaction would that be? If C is a sulfide, perhaps combustion to form SO2 and something else.

Alternatively, if C is a chloride, perhaps reaction with O2 would form ClO2 or something. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH4Cl, then reacting with O2 might form NO and ClO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a peroxide, like H2O2, which has a bent structure. The symmetry group of H2O2 is C2v. Because it's H-O-O-H, with a central O-O bond. The molecule is bent, and has a two-fold rotation axis (C2) and a mirror plane perpendicular to the bond (so overall symmetry C2v).

But is H2O2 formed from C reacting with O2? Let me think. If C is a peroxide precursor, like perhaps a peroxide salt. Alternatively, if C is a metal peroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's tie it all together. Let's imagine the various steps.

Assume:

- B is Cl2 (diatomic gas)
- D is O2 (diatomic gas)
- H is H2O (solvent, formed from H2 and O2)
- Reaction 4: O2 + H2 → H2O (with catalyst)
- Reaction 1: A + 8 Cl2 → C (bright red)
- Assume A is Na (so Na + Cl2 → NaCl), but 8 equivalents of Cl2 would require 16 moles of Na. Hmm, but NaCl is white.
Wait, perhaps A is another metal. Let's think, what metal reacts with Cl2 in large quantities to form a bright red product?

Wait, I'm stuck again. Let me think about the product C. If C reacts with water to form F (strong acid) and G (weak acid), then F and G could be HCl and H2SO3, for example. But H2SO3 is from a sulfite.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it forms NaOH (strong base, not acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid). Hmm, that's not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a phosphate salt. Let's say NaH2PO4. When it reacts with water, it would form H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps C is something like ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3. When it reacts with water, it just dissolves, but doesn't produce new acids.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, reacting with water gives NaOH and H2CO3 (weak acid). So again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is something like CuSO4·5H2O, but that's blue. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But then F would be H2S and G would be the hydroxide, which isn't an acid.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about the options and possible symmetry.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

D4h is the symmetry of a square planar molecule, like XeF4. D∞h is linear, like CO2 or HCN. C2v is for a bent molecule with a mirror plane, like H2O2 or O3.

If E is a linear molecule, it could be CO2 (D∞h) or O3 (C2v).

But under what conditions would C react with O2 to form O3? I don't think that's likely. Alternatively, maybe E is ClO2, which is a bent molecule with D2h symmetry. But D2h isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or something else, but O2 has O2 symmetry, which is D∞h.

Wait, but if E is O2, that's a diatomic gas, but the question says E is a product, which is extremely hazardous. O2 itself is not that hazardous, but maybe it's O3, which is toxic. O3 is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So E could be O3, making the symmetry group C2v, which is option D.

But how would E be formed? If C is a compound that upon reaction with O2 produces O3. Hmm, not sure about that reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a metal oxide that upon reaction with O2 forms another oxide. But that seems vague.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a peroxide. Let's say C is sodium oxide (Na2O), which reacts with O2 to form NaO2 (sodium peroxide). Sodium peroxide has the formula Na2O2, which has a structure with O-O single bond. The structure of O2^2- is linear, so symmetry D∞h. So if E is Na2O2, its symmetry is D∞h, which is option C.

But in that case, when C (Na2O) reacts with O2 (D) in a 1:1 ratio, but wait, the reaction would be 2 Na2O + O2 → 2 Na2O2. So 2 moles of Na2O + 1 mole of O2 → 2 moles of Na2O2. So the molar ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 2 equivalents of D, which is O2. So for 1 mole of C (Na2O), 1 mole of O2 is used. So the molar ratio would be 1:1. That fits.

So in reaction 2: C (Na2O) + 2 D (O2) → 2 E (Na2O2). Wait, no, because 2 Na2O + O2 → 2 Na2O2. So for each 2 moles of C, 1 mole of D is used, which is a 2:1 ratio. But the problem says 2 equivalents of D are used. So for 1 mole of C, 1 mole of D is used. So perhaps the reaction is C + D → E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is C + 2 D → E. Let me think:

If C is Na2O, D is O2, then reaction could be 2 Na2O + O2 → 2 Na2O2. So for 2 moles of C, 1 mole of D is used. So per mole of C, 0.5 mole of D is used. But the problem states 2 equivalents of D are used. Hmm, not matching.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about common products E that are extremely hazardous. For example, phosgene (COCl2) is hazardous, but I don't know its symmetry. Alternatively, ozone (O3) is hazardous, and has a C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, another thought: perhaps C is a nitride. When it reacts with O2, it forms NO (a toxic gas). NO has a linear structure, so symmetry D∞h. So if E is NO, the symmetry is D∞h, which is option C.

But how would C (a nitride) react with O2 to produce NO. The reaction would be something like:

C (e.g., Mg3N2) + O2 → MgO + NO.

Wait, but Mg3N2 + O2 → 3 MgO + 2 NO. So that's a possibility. Then, E is NO, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So option C would be correct.

But then, when C (Mg3N2) reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. But the problem states that two acids are formed. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again.

If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure similar to CO2 but with two Cl atoms. The molecule is linear, so its symmetry is D∞h. So if E is phosgene, then symmetry is D∞h (option C).

But how would that fit the reactions? Let's see.

Phosgene is produced from the reaction of COCl2 (which I'm not sure how it would form from C). Alternatively, perhaps C is PCl5, which reacts with O2 to form POCl3 and ClO2, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too speculative. Maybe I should think about the possible answers and see which makes sense.

The options are:

A) C2 → tetrahedral, like CH4.

B) D4h → square planar, like XeF4.

C) D∞h → linear, like CO2, O2.

D) C2v → bent, like H2O2.

If E is O3, which is a bent molecule, then symmetry is C2v (option D). Or if E is H2O2, then also C2v.

But if E is O2, then symmetry is D∞h (option C).

But what would E be in this scenario? Let's think of the reactions again.

If C is a metal chloride that is bright red, like mercury(I) chloride (Hg2Cl2), which is bright red. Then, when C reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to form HgO and HCl. So F would be HCl (strong acid), and G would be HgO, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is AgCl, which is white, but doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say C is PbS, which is bright red. Then, when PbS reacts with water, it doesn't react much, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can hydrolyze to Pb(OH)2 and H2S. H2S is a weak acid. So F could be H2S (weak), but where's the strong acid? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate. Let me think: if C is Ca(ClO)2, then when it reacts with water, it forms HClO (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (base, not acid). So again, only one acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. Let me think: if C is Ca(NO3)2, then when it reacts with water, it just dissolves, not producing acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say Na2CO3. It reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). But again, only one acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water would form NaOH and H2SO3 (weak acid). Again, only one acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible compounds that when reacted with water give two acids.

Wait, what if C is a diacid salt, like NaHPO4? When it reacts with water, it forms H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (base). Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2. But again, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide, like CaC2. Reacting with water would produce acetylene and Ca(OH)2. Not acids.

Wait, another angle: if C is a nitride, like AlN. Reacting with water would produce Al(OH)3 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the products when C reacts with D.

In reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E.

If D is O2, then E could be a product of oxidation. For example, if C is a sulfide, reacting with O2 would form SO2 or something.

Wait, but if E is SO2, what's its symmetry? SO2 is bent, with C2v symmetry. So option D.

So, if E is SO2, which is a toxic gas, its symmetry group is C2v.

But how does that fit into the other reactions?

Let me imagine:

- B is O2, D is O2? No, because then reaction 4 would need B and D to react to form H, a solvent. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas.

Wait, perhaps B is O2, D is F2? But F2 is a diatomic gas. Then H would be O2F2, which I'm not sure is a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something else. But I'm not making progress.

Another approach: think about product E and its possible structure.

If E has D4h symmetry, it's a square planar molecule. Examples include XeF4, which is a tetrahedral structure (but that's actually Td symmetry), wait no, XeF4 is square planar with D4h symmetry. So if E is XeF4, which is a square planar molecule, then symmetry is D4h (option B).

But how would that fit the reactions? It's unclear.

Alternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule like CH4, which has Td symmetry, but that's not an option here.

Wait, the options don't include Td, so perhaps it's another structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry (option C). So if E is CO2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h.

But how would CO2 be formed from C and D (O2)?

Let me imagine:

C is carbon (solid), reacts with O2 (D) to form CO2 (E). But in the problem, C is formed from A and B (O2?), which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO, which reacts with O2 to form CO2. But CO is a gas, not a bright red solid.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and the possible structures.

If E is O3, then the symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is H2O2, also C2v (option D). If E is SO2, also C2v. So, if the answer is D, then E would be one of these molecules.

Alternatively, if E is O2, then D∞h (option C).

But given the information, I think the most plausible answer is that E has C2v symmetry, making the correct option D.

The problem involves deducing the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - B is likely a diatomic gas, possibly Cl₂ or O₂.  
   - The bright red color of C suggests it could be a compound like CuCl₂ (though not red) or possibly a sulfide or oxide with red coloration.  

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce hazardous product E.  
   - D is also likely a diatomic gas. If B is Cl₂, D could be O₂.  
   - E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to compounds like O₃ (ozone), SO₂, or phosgene (COCl₂).  

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - This suggests C is likely an acidic salt or a compound that hydrolyzes to form acids.  

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - If B is Cl₂ and D is O₂, H could be H₂O (a common solvent).  

### Key Deductions:
- If E is O₃ (ozone), it is a bent molecule with **C₂v symmetry**.  
- If E is SO₂, it is also a bent molecule with **C₂v symmetry**.  
- If E is phosgene (COCl₂), it is linear with **D∞h symmetry**, but this does not align well with the reactions described.  
- O₂, a diatomic gas, has **D∞h symmetry**, but it is not described as hazardous enough to match the problem.  

Given the information and the options provided, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **C₂v**, consistent with bent molecules like O₃ or SO₂.
