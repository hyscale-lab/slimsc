Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. The question says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. 

Wait, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction should produce the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base. So the pH will depend on whether we're before the equivalence point, at it, or after.

First, let's figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles, and 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we titrate, the volume of NaOH added will change the solution. Let's think about the equivalence point first. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 is 25 mM, and 0.04 L is 40 mL, yeah, 25 * 40 = 1000 mmol, which is 1 mmol. 

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So at equivalence, moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume needed is moles / concentration, so 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how much NaOH is added. 25% of the equivalence point would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added? Because 10 mL is the equivalence, so 25% is 2.5 mL. 

Wait, no, wait. The 25% might refer to 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. Let me think. Or perhaps 25% of the volume added at equivalence. Hmm, sometimes in titration, the percentage can refer to the volume, but often it's the fraction of the acid neutralized.

Wait, the question says "25% titration." So that would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.00025 mol. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume added would be 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. So that's 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

So the solution at 25% titration would have some of the acetic acid converted to acetate. Let me model the solution.

At 25% titration, moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) remaining would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol, and moles of acetate (CH3COO-) formed would be 0.00025 mol. The total volume is the original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the exact values. Alternatively, perhaps using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be easier here. Since this is a buffer solution.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

Wait, pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let's calculate that. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is around 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256, which is about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate would be moles / total volume. Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH added) = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's calculate the pH.

Since Kb is very small, we can approximate that [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Wait wait, the options for equivalence point are varying. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10, correct. 

Wait, but wait, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So for the hydrolysis, the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]. Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, so pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. 

But wait, looking at the options, option A says equivalence pH is 8.52. Hmm, that's lower than my calculation. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the total volume I used is wrong. Let me recheck. Original solution is 40 cm³, and at equivalence, we added 10 cm³. So 50 cm³ total, 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That part seems correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's compute pH more precisely.

Calculate Kb again: 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405405e-10.

C is 0.02 M.

The expression Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, same as before.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is ~0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983 → pOH 4.983 → pH 9.017. So about 9.02.

But none of the options have that. Let me look again at the options.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → equivalence is 8.52. Hmm, that's lower.

Wait, maybe I messed up the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the dilution correctly. Wait, when you add 10 mL of NaOH to 40 mL of solution, the total is 50 mL. But what about the acetic acid and NaOH reacting?

Wait, but the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Adding 0.001 mol of NaOH (since 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol) reacts completely with the acetic acid to produce 0.001 mol of acetate and 0.001 mol of water.

So the acetate is 0.001 mol in 0.05 L → 0.02 M, correct.

Hmm, but the pH comes out to about 9.02, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using another method. Maybe using the formula for weak bases.

The hydrolysis reaction of acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw/Ka = 1e-14/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Using the approximation, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pH is 14 - pOH. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → equivalence pH is 8.52, which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Maybe the concentration of acetate is not 0.02 M. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the initial volume after dilution was 40 cm³ (0.04 L) with 0.001 mol of acetic acid. Then, when we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 mol of NaOH. So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol, moles of NaOH: 0.001 mol. So everything reacts, producing 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.

The total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³=0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm. So why is the pH not matching any options? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the Ka value is given as 1.85e-5, which is for 25 °C. Well, the solution is at 25 °C, so I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation without the approximation. Let me set up the equation without the assumption that x is negligible.

The Kb expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Let x be [OH^-]. Then,

( x * (x + [CH3COOH]) ) / (0.02 - x ) = 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, more accurately, the initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. When it reacts, it forms some OH- and CH3COOH. So the change would be:

CH3COO^-: 0.02 - x → approx 0.02, but let's not assume that. 

The equation becomes:

x^2 / (0.02 - x ) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)≈1.04e-5, same as before. So the approximation holds. So pH is about 9.02.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial total volume after titration is not 50 cm³. Wait, no, because we added 10 cm³ to the 40 cm³ solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of acetic acid. Let me double-check the initial dilution.

Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, correct. When diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration is 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about 25% of the solution being titrated, not 25% of the acid. No, that doesn't make sense. The 25% titration refers to the fraction of the acid neutralized.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the 25% part.

Wait, at 25% titration, the solution is a buffer, so using Henderson-Hasselbalch is correct. Let me recalculate that part.

pH = pKa + log ( [A-]/[HA] )

At 25% titration, [A-] is 0.25/1.25 * initial concentration? Wait, no, moles of A- are 0.25 of initial HA moles.

Wait, initial moles of HA (acetic acid) after dilution is 0.001 mol. 25% titrated means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of HA has reacted, producing 0.00025 mol of A-.

So [A-] = 0.00025 / (0.04 + 0.0025) L → 0.00025 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

[HA] = (0.001 - 0.00025) / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So [A-]/[HA] = (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.33333.

log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) → 4.733 - 0.477 ≈4.256 → 4.26. So that part seems correct.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. But our equivalence point calculation was 9.02, which is not matching any option.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me reevaluate the equivalence point.

Wait, maybe the NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume added is 10 mL, as I calculated. But perhaps I should consider the dilution of the solution when adding NaOH.

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and adding 10 cm³ of NaOH makes 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is with the assumption that the solution at equivalence point is just acetate. Maybe a common ion effect is involved? Or perhaps I should consider activity coefficients? No, I think that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, maybe the initial dilution is incorrect. Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles is 0.05 * 0.02 =0.001 mol. Diluted with 20 cm³ of water, so total volume 40 cm³. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L =0.025 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps the NaOH is 0.1 M, so when 10 mL is added, moles NaOH is 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol, same as moles of acetic acid. So everything reacts, producing 0.001 mol acetate.

Hmm, so why is the pH not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total volume during titration, not after. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point calculation should consider that when you add NaOH, some of the water is from the NaOH, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point more accurately without the approximation. Let me do that.

The Kb equation is Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, which it is, because 5.4e-10 *0.02 is about 1e-11, which is (x^2). So x is about 1e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02. So our approximation holds.

So pH is about 9.02, but none of the options have that. Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → 25% is 4.26, equivalence 8.52.

Option D: 4.57;6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point approach. Another way to calculate the pH is using the concentration of acetate and the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it using the formula for a weak base:

pH = ½ (pKb - log C )

Wait, pKb is log(1/(Ka * C))?

Wait, no, pKb is -log(Kb). Kb is 5.405e-10 → pKb is 9.266.

Wait, then the formula would be pH = ½ (pKw - pKb + log C) ?

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the hydrolysis of a weak base:

For a salt BA, B+ is the weak base. Its hydrolysis is B+ + H2O ↔ BH + OH^-

The pH can be found using:

pOH = (pKb + log C ) / 2

Wait, I think that's when the solution is a weak base with concentration C and Kb.

Wait, no, I think the formula is:

pOH = (pKb - log C)/2 → no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think. The formula for weak base pH is:

pH = (pKw - pKb + log C ) / 2.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about it again.

The correct approach is to calculate [OH^-] using the Kb expression.

But when C >> Kb, the approximation holds, but when C is not much larger than Kb, you have to solve a quadratic equation.

Wait, in our case, C is 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.4e-10. So 0.02 is much larger than Kb, so x is much smaller than 0.02.

So the approximation holds, and x is about sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) ≈1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial step of mixing the acetic acid and water before titration.

Wait, when we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is 0.025 M, correct. But perhaps the dilution changes the dissociation. Wait, no, the dilution step would just change the concentration, but the Ka remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that at the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer? No, because all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate, so it's a solution of acetate ion, which is a weak base.

Wait, perhaps when I dilute the solution with water, the pH changes, but in our case, the initial solution after dilution is a 0.025 M acetic acid, which would have a pH higher than its pure form but lower than the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where the 25% titration pH is around 4.26, which is option A, but then what about the equivalence point?

Wait, another approach: Maybe the equivalence point isn't at 10 mL. Let me recalculate the equivalence point.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH = 0.001 mol /0.1 M = 0.01 L =10 mL. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial solution's dilution. Wait, wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the initial solution's pH is not 4.73, but that doesn't affect the titration pH.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D says at 25% titration, pH is 4.57, which is higher than our calculated 4.26. So perhaps that's not the correct option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration calculation. Let me double-check.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol. So the solution has 0.00075 mol of HA and 0.00025 mol of A-.

Total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) +2.5 cm³ (NaOH) =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration of HA: 0.00075 /0.0425 =0.017647 M.

Concentration of A-: 0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 =0.3333. Log(1/3)= -0.477. pH =4.733 -0.477=4.256 →4.26. So that's correct.

Wait, but the equivalence point in the options is 8.52 (option A) and 6.92 (option D). My calculation is 9.02, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point's pH. Let me try another method, perhaps using the exact formula for a weak base.

The exact expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Let x = [OH^-]. Then,

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x )

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x² =5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 →x= 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, I'm confident in this calculation, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial dilution was done before titration, but when the NaOH is added, it's also a strong base, so maybe the temperature affects the Ka, but the problem states 25°C, so that's accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the initial concentrations after dilution, not considering the added NaOH volume.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the added NaOH changes the volume and the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → 25% is our calculated 4.26, but equivalence is 8.52.

Our calculated equivalence is 9.02, which is not present. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the equivalence point using a more precise method.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is not considering the dilution when adding NaOH. Let's see. When you add 10 mL of NaOH to 40 mL of solution, the total is 50 mL. So the concentration is 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb:

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the square root. Let's calculate sqrt(1.081e-11) precisely.

1e-11 is 1e-11. 1.081e-11 is 1.081 ×1e-11. The square root of 1.081 is approximately 1.0398. So sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.0398e-5.5 → wait, no, because 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2.

Wait, 1.0398e-5.5 is roughly 3.2e-6? No, wait. Let me think differently. sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) = approx 1.0398 * 1e-5.5 → but 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6. So 1.0398 *3.16e-6 ≈3.29e-6. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation was 1.04e-5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the square root calculation.

Wait, wait, 1.081e-11 is 1.081 × 1e-11. The square root is sqrt(1.081) × sqrt(1e-11).

sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6.

sqrt(1.081)= approximately 1.0398.

So 1.0398 ×3.16e-6 ≈ 3.29e-6. Wait, but that's 3.29e-6, which is 3.29e-6 → [OH^-] =3.29e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Wait, wait! Wait, that's different. Did I miscalculate earlier?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. So sqrt(1.081e-11)= sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11)= 1.0398 * 3.16e-6 ≈3.29e-6. So [OH^-]=3.29e-6 → pOH= -log(3.29e-6) → log(3.29)=0.517, so pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517→ about 8.52.

Wait, but earlier I thought sqrt(1.081e-11) was 1.04e-5, but that's incorrect. Because 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2, which is 3.16e-6. So 1.081e-11 is (1.0398e-5.5)^2. So sqrt(1.081e-11)= 1.0398e-5.5 = 3.29e-6.

Wait, that changes everything. So earlier, I thought x=1.04e-5, but that's wrong. It should be 3.29e-6.

So pOH= -log(3.29e-6)= about 5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah! So that's where option A comes from. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but why did I get a different value earlier? Because I think I confused the exponents. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5=3.1623e-6.

sqrt(1.081)= approx 1.0398.

So 1.0398 *3.1623e-6 → 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.29e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah, that makes sense now. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

So the 25% titration pH is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted to 0.025 M in 40.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Setup**
- **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³, so the concentration becomes:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of CH₃COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.  
- **Moles of CH₃COOH reacted:**  
  \[
  0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:**  
  \[
  0.001 \, \text{mol} - 0.00025 \, \text{mol} = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (acetate) formed:**  
  \[
  0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH:**  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentrations:**  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right),
  \]
  where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \).  
  Substituting the ratio:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
  \]

### **Step 3: Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻).  
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ at equivalence:**  
  \[
  0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume after adding 10.00 cm³ of NaOH:**  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentration of CH₃COO⁻:**  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **Hydrolysis of acetate ion:**  
  \[
  \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
  \]
  The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).
- **Using the approximation for weak bases:**  
  \[
  [\text{OH⁻}] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.02)} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **pOH and pH:**  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
  \]
