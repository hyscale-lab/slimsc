Alright, so I've got this question here about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which one never requires regularization at high energies. Let me think through this step by step.

Okay, first, what's regularization in physics? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals and other infinities. It helps make the calculations finite so you can renormalize the theory. But some theories might not need this because they are already finite or perhaps because another mechanism handles the infinities.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory: I think string theory deals with strings as fundamental particles. Strings are one-dimensional, right? And I remember that string theories have a concept called the "t Hooft vertex" or something like that. Wait, but more importantly, string theories are supposed to be background-dependent and have a minimum length scale, the string length. So maybe they don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because the theory is inherently different. Or perhaps they require regularization because of the loop integrals in perturbative calculations? I'm a bit fuzzy here.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? And it's known to be asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. But in practice, when you do perturbative calculations in QCD, you might get divergences that require regularization. But wait, does it need it? I think because QCD is a non-renormalizable theory? Or wait, no, wait. QCD is actually a renormalizable theory. So you can absorb the infinities via renormalization. But does that mean regularization is needed during the calculation process? I think yes, because even though it's renormalizable, you still need to regularize the divergent integrals before renormalizing. So B might require regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism, an abelian gauge theory. I know that QED is a renormalizable theory. So during calculations, like loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. To handle these, you regularize them, maybe using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or other methods. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C is out.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: This is the non-quantum version, right? So in classical E&M, you don't have the same issues of divergences because you're not dealing with quantum fluctuations. But wait, even in classical theory, certain concepts like the self-energy of a charge can have divergences. For example, the electric field of a point charge gives an infinite self-energy. But in classical theory, how is that handled? Well, in classical physics, I think these divergences are typically ignored or handled in a different way, perhaps by considering the charges as distributions or by using methods like the method of images or regularization in classical contexts. Wait, but in classical theory, do we actually need regularization in the same sense as in quantum field theory? Because regularization in QFT is a way to make perturbative calculations manageable by taming the infinities. In classical E&M, maybe you don't need regularization because you don't have the same divergent loop integrals. Or perhaps in some formulations you do, but maybe it's handled differently.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. Let me think again. Superstring theory is a candidate. Because string theories deal with higher-dimensional objects and perhaps have better behavior at high energies. Wait, but isn't string theory also a quantum theory, so it would have similar issues with divergences as QFTs? Or maybe string theory's perturbative series is different. Oh wait, I think in string theory, the perturbative expansion is in terms of the string coupling, and they might have less divergence because of the way the interactions are structured. Or perhaps string theory requires regularization because of the infinite sums in the perturbative expansion (like the number of states in a string theory is infinite, leading to potential divergences), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that some theories are finite. For example, if a theory is free (non-interacting), then it doesn't have divergences. But the options given are all interacting theories except maybe classical E&M? No, QED and QCD are definitely interacting.

Wait another thought: regularization is about making the theory mathematically manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff, which is then removed after renormalization. So which of these theories don't require this because they're already free of such divergences?

Wait, maybe the correct answer is D) Classical Electrodynamics. Because in classical E&M, you don't have the same issues with divergent loop integrals as in quantum theories. But wait, the self-energy of a charge is infinite in classical E&M. Do they require regularization? Or is that a different kind of problem?

Wait, in the context of the question, which is about high energies, perhaps it's about ultraviolet divergences. In QED and QCD, these are a big issue, requiring regularization. In classical E&M, maybe you don't need regularization because you're not quantizing the fields. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, superstring theory might not require regularization because it's a theory that's finite. Or maybe because it's a background theory, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Which of these theories are known to be non-renormalizable? Well, QED is renormalizable, as is QCD. String theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, which is non-renormalizable. But non-renormalizable theories usually require an infinite number of counterterms, implying that standard renormalization isn't enough. But that doesn't directly speak to whether regularization is needed. Because even non-renormalizable theories can use regularization techniques; it's just that they don't have a finite number of terms to absorb the divergences.

Wait, but the question is about whether regularization is ever required. So if a theory is already finite, no regularization is needed. Which theory is finite?

Wait, I think I remember that in the Standard Model, only the gauge couplings and masses require renormalization. But I'm not sure if any of these theories are finite.

Wait, another thought: maybe in the high-energy limit, which of these theories don't have issues that require regularization.

Wait, the question is which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So perhaps for some theories, like classical E&M, you don't need regularization because you're not quantizing it, so the divergences are a QFT issue.

Alternatively, string theories might not need regularization because they have a different way of handling high energies, perhaps due to the stringy nature smoothing out the divergences.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. I think that in perturbative string theory, you still have to deal with loop divergences, which require regularization. But string theories are supposed to be finite when you include all the necessary terms. Wait, no, in string theory, the perturbative expansion is in terms of the string coupling. The tree-level amplitudes are finite, but loop amplitudes can lead to divergences. So in that case, string theories might still require regularization for loop calculations.

So then, which option is left? The only option that doesn't require regularization would be the one that's free of such infinities. So perhaps the answer is D) Classical Electrodynamics, because in the classical theory, the divergences are handled differently, perhaps not requiring the same kind of regularization as in quantum theories.

Wait, but wait. In classical E&M, you can have self-energy problems, but perhaps these are handled by considering the charge as a distribution or something, rather than the regularization used in QFT. So the question is about the need for regularization in the sense used in quantum field theories. So classical theories wouldn't require that kind of regularization because they aren't formulated using the same framework.

In that case, the correct answer would be D. Because only classical E&M doesn't require regularization as it's not a quantum theory where regularization is needed for loop integrals and renormalization.

So the options are A) Superstring Theory: possibly needs regularization. B) QCD: needs it. C) QED: needs it. D) Classical Electrodynamics: doesn't need it because it's not a quantum theory requiring regularization.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options as follows:

### Regularization in Physics
Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory (QFT) to handle divergent integrals and infinities that arise in calculations, particularly in loop diagrams. It is not typically required in classical theories, as they do not involve the same divergences inherent in QFT.

---

### Option Analysis

**A) Superstring Theory**  
Superstring theory is a quantum theory that describes particles as one-dimensional strings. While it is a candidate for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity, it still involves perturbative calculations with loop integrals, which can lead to divergences. Regularization techniques are often used in these calculations. Thus, superstring theory does require regularization in practice.

**B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, describing the behavior of quarks and gluons. It is a renormalizable theory, meaning that while regularization is used to handle divergences in calculations, the infinities can ultimately be absorbed through renormalization. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

**C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
QED is the theory of electromagnetism, describing the interactions of charged particles with photons. It is also a renormalizable theory, and divergences in loop diagrams are managed using regularization techniques. Hence, QED requires regularization.

**D) Classical Electrodynamics**  
Classical electrodynamics is the non-quantum theory of electricity and magnetism. While it deals with concepts like the self-energy of charges, these divergences are handled differently in classical physics, often through approximations or redefinitions rather than the regularization used in QFT. Since it is not a quantum theory, classical electrodynamics does not require regularization in the same sense as QED, QCD, or superstring theory.

### Conclusion
Among the options, only **Classical Electrodynamics** does not require regularization in the context of high-energy physics, as it is not formulated within the framework of quantum field theory where regularization is typically necessary.
