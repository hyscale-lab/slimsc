Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The question gives me four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me the desired product with high yield.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize what's going on. The structure is benzene with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, nitro at 3, and ethoxy at position 1. Wait, wait, wait—I think I might have mixed up the numbering. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, the IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the ring is ortho to meta in some way. But the exact arrangement depends on the order of substitution.

So, benzene rings undergo substitution reactions, typically electrophilic substitution. The order in which the substituents are added will determine their positions relative to each other because each substituent can direct the next substitution.

Now, looking at the functional groups: nitro is a meta-director, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Wait, no: tert-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group, so it's ortho/para directing. Nitro is deactivating and meta directing. Ethoxy is activating (since it's an O-containing group, like an ether), so it's ortho/para.

But wait, the substituents in the target molecule are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me think about how to get them there.

So, the target is 2-tert-butyl, 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So, looking at the ring, substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), and 2 and 3 are also adjacent, making it a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.

Hmm. How do the directing effects influence where each substituent comes in?

I think I need to plan out the order of substitution. Let's think about each step.

The starting material is benzene. Let's consider each substituent. The positions of the substituents depend on the order in which they're added.

Option 1: Let's say we add the nitro group first. Nitration is a meta-directing reaction. But if I add nitro first, then the next substituent (like ethoxy) would go in the meta position relative to nitro. But I think the target has nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of adding substituents is: tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or another order.

Wait, let me think about each substituent's impact. Let's start by adding the ethoxy group. Benzene can be nitrated first. Wait, no, maybe it's better to add the strongest activating groups first because they are more reactive and can direct better.

Wait, no. Nitration is a strong deactivating group. If you add nitro first, benzene becomes less reactive, so the next substituents might be harder to add. Alternatively, if you add activating groups first, the subsequent reactions are easier.

So, the substituents we are adding are tert-butyl (activating, alkyl group), ethoxy (activating, ether), and nitro (deactivating, meta director). So perhaps it's better to add the activating groups first, as they make the ring more reactive towards further electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director and deactivating. So, if I add nitro first, the next substituent will be directed to the meta position relative to nitro. But in the target, the substituents are adjacent. Hmm, maybe nitro isn't the first group to add.

Alternatively, maybe I need to add the groups in an order that allows each next substituent to be added in the correct position based on the directing effects.

Let me think: Suppose I first add the tert-butyl group. That's an activating, ortho/para director. So the next substituent would go into ortho or para.

Then, the next substituent could be ethoxy. The ethoxy is also activating and ortho/para directing. So, if the ring has a tert-butyl group, the ethoxy could add either ortho or para to it.

But the target has ethoxy in position 1 and tert-butyl in position 2, which are adjacent. So, if tert-butyl is in position 2, then ethoxy in position 1 is ortho to it. Hmm, that suggests that ethoxy was added after tert-butyl.

Wait, but to have ortho substitution, the substituent would have to be added in the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first. Let's say benzene is first treated with ethoxy (using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? Wait, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl halides. But ethoxy group is OCH2CH3; to add that, you can use a nucleophilic substitution, but wait, benzene isn't nucleophilic enough. Wait, perhaps it's an ether substitution, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe using a tosylate or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group comes from a nitration followed by reduction or something else. Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution, but I think more likely it's introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually for deactivated rings.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring is already substituted with a nitro group, which is a meta director. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each substituent in order of their reaction steps in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of steps, possibly including nitration, alkylation, sulfonation, etc.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Steps are t-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), then NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), dilute H2SO4, H3O+ H2O/heat, NaOH/EtBr (alkylation, maybe SN2?), Fe/HCl (reduction?), HNO3/H2SO4.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about each step. After t-butyl alkylation, nitration would occur. The t-butyl is activating, so nitration would occur in ortho or para. But since we already have the t-butyl in position 2, the nitro could go in position 3 (ortho to t-Bu? Or meta? Wait, wait, no. The t-Bu is in position 2. Nitration occurs in ortho or para to t-Bu. So nitro would go in position 1 (para to t-Bu) or position 3 (ortho to t-Bu). So in the target, nitro is at position 3. So that's ortho to t-Bu. So option A's step ii is nitration after t-Bu alkylation. So after that, in the target, nitro is ortho to t-Bu, which is position 3. So that would give a nitro in position 3. Then step iii is sulfonation. Sulfonation introduces a -SO3H group. Where would that happen? The ring now has t-Bu in 2, nitro in 3. Sulfonating would be directed by the existing substituents. Nitro is meta-directing, and t-Bu is ortho/para. The most activating group is t-Bu, so the next substituent (sulfonic acid) would be directed by it.

But wait, sulfonating is a strong deactivating group. So, adding SO3H would make the ring less reactive. Then, step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. Then, H2SO4 dilute. Then, H3O+ and heat. That's hydrolysis, perhaps of a diazonium salt. Then step vii: NaOH and EtBr. That's a Williamson ether synthesis? Or perhaps an SN2 alkylation, but in that case, the ethoxy group would come in. Then, Fe/HCl could be a reduction, perhaps of a nitro group to amine, but I'm not sure. Finally, step ix: another nitration.

But the target has only one nitro group, so maybe this is a wrong path.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me approach the problem differently.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are t-Bu (2), nitro (3), and ethoxy (1). So positions 1, 2, 3 are all substituted.

So, thinking about the order of substitution:

Possibility 1: Add the ethoxy first. Then, add t-Bu. Then, nitro.

But ethoxy is activating. So first, after ethoxy substitution, the next substituent (t-Bu) would be added in ortho or para positions. Let's say we add t-Bu in the para position to ethoxy. Then, the next substituent, nitro, would be directed based on the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the order is t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Let's see.

Step 1: Alkylation with t-BuCl using AlCl3 as catalyst. So benzene becomes toluene analog but with t-Bu. So, benzene -> 2-t-Bu benzene? Wait, no, the position depends on where the alkylation occurs. Since it's the first substitution, it can go anywhere, but the substitution is random. So the product would be a mixture, but since it's a high-yield question, maybe it's a specific regiochemistry.

Wait, but for the target, t-Bu is at position 2. So if I add t-Bu first, then where would the next substituent go?

Suppose the first substituent is t-Bu in position 2. Then, the next substituent (ethoxy) would be added in ortho or para to t-Bu. So, ethoxy could be in position 1 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But in the target, position 1 is ethoxy, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2). So that works. Then, the next substituent is nitro, which is a meta director. Where would that go?

After t-Bu and ethoxy are in positions 2 and 1, respectively. The ring now has two substituents: t-Bu is activating (ortho/para) and ethoxy is activating (ortho/para). Which substituent is more activating? Alkyl groups are stronger activating than ethers, I think. So the next substituent (nitro) would be directed by the t-Bu group.

But wait, nitro is a deactivating group and meta-directing. So when adding nitro to a ring with t-Bu and ethoxy, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the directing effects of the substituents.

Wait, the nitration would be directed by the strongest activating substituent. The t-Bu is stronger activating than ethoxy. So the nitro would go ortho or para to the t-Bu. Let me see the positions. t-Bu is at 2, ethoxy at 1. So the positions available for nitro would be 3 (ortho to t-Bu) or 4 (para to t-Bu). But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So if nitro is added third, it would go to position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu.

But wait, after adding t-Bu at position 2 and ethoxy at position 1, the ring would have substituents in 1 and 2. The next substitution would be directed by t-Bu and ethoxy. But which directs where?

Wait, perhaps the nitro would be added in a position that is ortho or para to t-Bu but not conflicting with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

If ethoxy is added first, it would be at position 1. Then, t-Bu is added ortho to ethoxy, which would be position 2. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Next, nitro is added, which is meta to ethoxy. Wait, ethoxy is ortho/para directing, so adding nitro would be either ortho or para to ethoxy. But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). Hmm, but that would be meta to ethoxy. Wait, no. Ethoxy is at position 1. Position 3 is meta to position 1 only if the ring is numbered such that 1 and 3 are meta. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 and 3 are meta.

Wait, yes. So if ethoxy is at position 1, then meta would be position 4. Wait, no, because in benzene, position 1 has adjacent positions 2 and 6. Then position 3 is two away from 1 (1, 2, 3), so 1 and 3 are meta? Or are they ortho?

Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, each next. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, etc. So, the positions go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and back to 1.

Therefore, position 1 and 3 are two positions apart. So when you have substituent at 1, the meta position is 4, right? Because 1, 3, 5 are meta to each other. So, position 1's meta is position 4. So if I have an ethoxy group at position 1, the nitro group, being meta to it, would go to position 4. But the target has nitro at position 3, which would be para to ethoxy (since 1 and 3 are across two positions, but wait, no, 1 and 3 are meta. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is not ethoxy first.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because adding a deactivating group last might be tricky.

Wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So, after adding t-Bu and ethoxy, perhaps the nitro is added in position 3.

But how could that happen? The first two substituents (t-Bu and ethoxy) are in positions 2 and 1. Then, the next substituent would be nitro, which is a meta director. But which substituent directs it?

Wait, the t-Bu is in position 2. So nitro would be either ortho (position 1, which is already occupied by ethoxy) or para (position 6). So that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is in position 1, and the t-Bu in position 3. Then, nitro would be meta to t-Bu, which would be position 6. Hmm, not matching the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro first, then t-Bu, then ethoxy.

If nitro is added first, it will be in some position, say position 3. Then, t-Bu would be added in ortho or para to nitro. Nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would be in positions 1 or 5 (if meta), but wait, nitro is meta-directing. So the next substituent would be in positions 1 or 5 relative to nitro.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let's consider each step's purpose.

The target has three substituents: t-Bu, ethoxy, nitro.

Each option's steps involve:

- Alkylation (probably Friedel-Crafts) with t-BuCl.

- Nitration.

- Sulfonation (introducing -SO3H group).

- Diazotization (using NaNO2 and HCl).

- H2SO4, H3O+/heat (possibly hydrolysis or diazonium salt decomposition).

- NaOH and EtBr (perhaps for ether formation via SN2).

- Fe/HCl (possibly for reduction, like converting nitro to amine).

So, perhaps the steps involve multiple nitration steps, sulfonation, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is synthesized via a combination of alkylation, nitration, and sulfonation, and then perhaps some substitution reactions.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So any sulfonation steps would need to be reversed, perhaps via hydrolysis.

Wait, if a sulfonic acid group is introduced, it's a strong meta director. But the target doesn't have it, so perhaps it's introduced as a leaving group.

Wait, maybe the sulfonic acid is introduced, then removed via some reaction. Or perhaps it's used as an activating group for another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is used to direct another substituent.

Wait, let's think about the order of reactions.

Let me outline the possible steps for each option.

Option B: Steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, so benzene becomes 2-t-Bu benzene (assuming it's the only substitution or in position 2).

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate. Since t-Bu is activating, nitration occurs ortho or para. So nitro could be at 1 or 3.

iii) Fe/HCl: probably a reduction step. But nitro group is reduced to amine? But in the target, nitro is present, so maybe this is not the case.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration? But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems odd.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option C: Steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: alkylation, position 2.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the sulfonic acid would go into the ring, but where? The ring has t-Bu in 2, so the sulfonic acid could be in position 4 (para to t-Bu) or position 1 (ortho). But position 1 is where ethoxy is in the target.

Then, iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration would be directed by the sulfonic acid group. Since sulfonic acid is a strong meta director, nitro would go into position 3 (if sulfonic is in position 4, then meta would be position 1).

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, so perhaps this is possible.

iv) Fe/HCl: reduction. Maybe reduce the nitro group to an amine? But in the target, nitro is present, so maybe not.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. So maybe the amine is converted into diazonium.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration. Hmm, but the target already has one nitro, so perhaps this isn't right.

Option D: Steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate benzene. Nitro group is added, say at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine. So now, benzene has an amine group in position 1.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3: alkylation. Now, the ring has an amine group. Where would t-Bu add? Amine is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So t-Bu would add in ortho or para to the amine.

Amine is in position 1. So t-Bu would go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). In the target, t-Bu is in position 2, so that fits.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration. Now, the ring has amine (1), t-Bu (2). Where would nitro add?

Amine is activating, but it's a strong director. So nitro would go ortho or para to amine. Ortho positions are 2 (already taken by t-Bu), or position 3. Para would be position 5. So nitro would go to position 3 or 5. Target has nitro at 3, so that's possible. Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl (diazotization).

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Now, the ring has amine (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3). Where would sulfonic acid go? Since amine is present, but it's a strong activating group. Wait, but amine is a strong activating group, but in reality, amines are actually deactivating because they're electron-rich and can deactivate the ring via conjugation. Wait, no, amines are activating (ortho/para directors). But once they're protonated (if acidic), they become deactivating (meta directors). But in this case, perhaps after nitration, the amine is protonated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is added in a position directed by the existing groups.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this is not the correct path.

Wait, but the target needs an ethoxy group. Looking at the steps in the options, I see steps like NaOH and EtBr. That's often used in the Williamson ether synthesis, but that's for creating ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Alternatively, NaOH and EtBr would be an SN2 reaction, perhaps introducing an ethoxy group.

Looking at option D: after several steps, step vii is dilute H2SO4. Then viii is H3O+ and heat, which might be for hydrolysis. Then ix is NaOH and EtBr.

Wait, perhaps in step ix, they're doing an alkoxy group substitution. If there's a leaving group (like a nitro group converted to something else), perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the steps in the correct order.

Another approach: the target has three substituents: t-Bu (2), ethoxy (1), nitro (3). So, perhaps the order is nitro addition first, but that's a deactivating group. Then, adding ethoxy and t-Bu.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. So if nitro is added first, then ethoxy would go in meta to nitro. Let's see: nitro in position 3. Ethoxy would go in position 1 (ortho to nitro?) No, wait, nitro is a meta director. So the next substituent would be in position 1 or 5 relative to nitro. So ethoxy in position 1. Then, t-Bu could be added in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy.

So the order would be nitro first (position 3), then ethoxy (position 1), then t-Bu (position 2).

But how to achieve that via the given options.

Looking for an option where nitration is done early, followed by alkylation.

Looking at option D:

Step i: Nitrate benzene: gives nitrobenzene. Nitro in position 1? Or any position? But the target has nitro in 3. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about each option's steps leading to the target.

The target requires three substituents. Each option's steps involve more than three steps, so perhaps some steps are for introducing and then removing groups.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a sulfonic acid group as a directing group, then substituting it with another group. For example, sulfonic acid could be used to direct a nitration, and then later, the sulfonic acid is removed (e.g., hydrolyzed), allowing another group to be added.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is used to activate the ring for further substitution.

Wait, the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so any step introducing SO3 would need to be followed by its removal. For example, sulfonation followed by desulfonation.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve multiple nitrations, but the target has only one nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

2. Add ethoxy group via another alkylation or substitution.

3. Add nitro group via nitration.

Wait, but how to get ethoxy on the ring. Because ethoxy is an ether group, which is usually added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation of an oxygen-containing group, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for adding ethers. Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group, but that seems unlikely because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added in a position where the ring is activated. For example, after adding a strong activating group like t-Bu.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an SN2 reaction on a benzyl halide, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I'm not considering all the steps in the options. Let me look at option D again.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene: nitro group added, say in position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine. So amine in position 1.

iii) Alkylation with t-BuCl: t-Bu would add in ortho or para to amine. So t-Bu in position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Target has t-Bu in 2, so that fits.

iv) Nitrate again: now, the ring has amine (1) and t-Bu (2). The next nitration would be directed by the strongest activating group, which is the amine. So nitro would go in ortho (position 2, taken) or para (position 5). Hmm, but target has nitro in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps option D is not correct.

Looking at option B:

Steps:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: t-Bu added, say in position 2.

ii) Nitrate: nitro added ortho or para to t-Bu. So nitro could be in position 1 or 3.

If nitro is in position 3, that's correct.

iii) Fe/HCl: maybe reducing nitro to amine? But target has nitro, so that might not be correct.

iv) Nitrate again: target doesn't have two nitros, so this seems wrong.

So option B is probably not correct.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: t-Bu in position 2.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation. Sulfonic acid is added, perhaps in position 4 (para to t-Bu).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration, which is directed by the sulfonic acid. Since sulfonic acid is meta director, nitro would be in position 1 (meta to SO3 in 4).

iv) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine? Again, target has nitro, so this doesn't fit.

v) Diazotization: not sure.

vi) HNO3 again: again, target doesn't have two nitros.

So option C seems off.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3: t-Bu in 2.

ii) HNO3: nitro in 1 or 3. Let's say 3.

iii) SO3: sulfonic acid added. Where? t-Bu is in 2, nitro in 3. The next substituent would be directed by the most activating group. t-Bu is activating, so sulfonic acid would go ortho or para. But t-Bu is in 2, so para would be position 6, ortho would be position 1 or 3. Position 3 is taken by nitro, so sulfonic acid could go to 1 or 6. If it goes to 1, that's where ethoxy is in the target. Hmm, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps it's removed later.

But how?

Step iv in option A is NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. Then step v: dilute H2SO4. Maybe hydrolyzing a diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group. Then step vi: H3O+ and heat: perhaps acid workup. Then step vii: NaOH and EtBr. That's an SN2 reaction, perhaps introducing an ethoxy group. Wait, if there's a good leaving group, like a tosylate or a nitro group converted into a leaving group, then NaOH and EtBr would substitute it.

But in the target, we have an ethoxy group. So perhaps in option A, after introducing sulfonic acid, which was in position 1, then perhaps steps iv to vii remove the sulfonic acid and introduce ethoxy.

Wait, but sulfonic acid is a strong acid and not easily displaced. Unless it's converted into something else. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is first converted into a nitro group, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option A is:

t-BuCl → nitrate → sulfonate → nitrate again → make diazonium → hydrolyze → ethoxy substitution.

But I'm not sure.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead think about each step's purpose.

The target requires a tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro group in specific positions. The synthesis likely requires directing each substitution appropriately.

Another approach: let's imagine the correct order of substituents.

To get the substituents in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro), the order of substitution must be such that each new substituent is correctly positioned relative to the existing ones.

Possibly, adding t-Bu first (position 2), then nitro (position 3) (since t-Bu is ortho/para director and nitro is meta to t-Bu would be position 5, but in the target nitro is adjacent. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, adding ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, if ethoxy is added first, it's in position 1. Then t-Bu is added ortho to ethoxy, position 2. Now, the substituents are in 1 and 2. Next, nitro is added. The ring now has ethoxy (activating, o/p) and t-Bu (activating, o/p). The strongest activating groups are t-Bu and ethoxy. So nitration would be directed by them.

But position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2), so it's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. So, which group is stronger in directing?

I think the t-Bu is a stronger activating group than ethoxy, so nitro would go ortho to t-Bu, which is position 3. That's exactly what we need.

So the order would be: ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts? Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups. To add ethoxy, you can't directly do Friedel-Crafts because it's an ether. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution, but that's difficult with benzene.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction, but that requires a good leaving group. Maybe using a tosylate or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strongly activated ring, such as one with a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but in our case, after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated, which could help in adding ethoxy via substitution. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, like using a Grignard reagent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the options, the steps include NaOH and EtBr. That's a common condition for the Williamson ether synthesis, but that typically involves an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. But in the context of aromatic substitution, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but for that, there must be a good leaving group on the aromatic ring. Maybe a nitro group is converted into a nitroso or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using an ethoxy group, but that's not straightforward since Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for adding ether groups.

I'm getting stuck on how to add the ethoxy group. Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after the ring has a good leaving group. For example, if the ring has a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group under certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a sulfonic acid group, then substituting it with ethoxy.

So, in the synthesis steps:

1. Introduce t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce sulfonic acid group via sulfonation.

3. Nitrate to add nitro group.

4. Remove sulfonic acid and introduce ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking for the correct order of substituents in the options. Let me consider each option's steps.

Option D: i) nitration; ii) reduction; iii) alkylation; iv) nitration; v) diazotization; vi) sulfonation; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+/heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So, step i: nitro in position 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine in position 1.

Step iii: alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu in position 2 (ortho to amine).

Step iv: nitrate → where? The ring has amine (1) and t-Bu (2). Nitration would be directed by amine. So, nitro in position 3 (ortho to amine, but position 2 is taken by t-Bu, so para would be position 5). So nitro in position 5. But target has nitro in 3. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps option D isn't correct.

Option B: steps lead to two nitrations, which the target doesn't have, so probably incorrect.

Option C: another nitration step, which may not fit.

Option A: after t-Bu and nitro, sulfonic acid is added, then steps involving diazotization, and then substitution with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps in option A, after adding t-Bu and nitro, sulfonic acid is added in position 1. Then, steps iv to vii involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not fully sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro via nitration, ortho to t-Bu (position 3).

3. Add ethoxy via substitution after activating the ring.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution of a nitro group. No, nitro groups aren't good leaving groups under normal conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve converting a substituent into a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonic acid is a leaving group. So, after adding sulfonic acid, perhaps it's replaced with ethoxy group.

But in option A, after sulfonating, steps involve diazotization, which is for amines. But if the ring has a sulfonic acid group, perhaps that's not the case.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

The target has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. The substituents are t-Bu (activating, ortho/para), ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), and nitro (deactivating, meta).

The correct order of substitution is likely: t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Because after t-Bu is added, ethoxy is introduced in the ortho position. Then, nitro is added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, but that's also adjacent to t-Bu.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Looking for an option where t-Bu is added first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking at option B: after t-Bu, nitro, then Fe/HCl (which I'm not sure about), then another nitro. So probably not.

Option D: nitrates first, which seems less likely.

Option C: after t-Bu, sulfonates, then nitrates. Doesn't seem right.

Option A: t-Bu, nitrate, sulfonate, etc. Maybe.

Wait, perhaps in option A, after adding t-Bu and nitro, sulfonating, then some steps to introduce ethoxy.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not confident.

Another way: the target has ethoxy in position 1, t-Bu in 2, and nitro in 3.

So, the substitution order would be:

1. Ethoxy in position 1.

2. t-Bu in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Nitro in position 3 (meta to ethoxy, ortho to t-Bu).

But how to add ethoxy first.

But I don't see any option where ethoxy is added first. All options start with t-BuCl or nitration.

Wait, the options start with either t-BuCl or nitration. So perhaps the correct order is to add t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking back, which option does that?

Option D: starts with nitration, which may not be correct.

Option A: starts with t-Bu, then nitrates. So nitro in position 3. Then sulfonates. Then steps to introduce ethoxy.

If sulfonic acid is introduced in position 1, perhaps it's then replaced by ethoxy.

In option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which could be the substitution step. So NaOH would deprotonate something, EtBr would provide the ethoxy group.

So, if after sulfonating position 1, then through some steps, the sulfonic acid is converted into a leaving group, and then substituted with ethoxy.

But how? Sulfonic acid isn't a good leaving group. Maybe it's converted into a tosylate, but that usually requires a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is removed by hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option A are:

1. t-BuCl → t-Bu in 2.

2. Nitrate → nitro in 3.

3. Sulfonate → SO3H in position 1 (ortho to t-Bu).

Then, steps iv to vii: diazotization, H2SO4, H3O+/heat → perhaps hydrolyzing some group to a hydroxyl.

Then, step vii: NaOH and EtBr → perhaps substituting a leaving group (like bromide) with ethoxy.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the SO3 group is converted into a nitro group, but that seems unclear.

I think I'm not going to get further, so I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options and the analysis, I think the correct option is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy in position 1, which is adjacent to t-Bu in 2. So, the ethoxy must have been added after t-Bu, since t-Bu is activating and would direct the ethoxy to ortho.

Looking at the steps in the options, which option introduces ethoxy after t-Bu and nitro.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu in 2.

ii) nitrate → nitro in 3.

iii) sulfonate → maybe in 1 (ortho to t-Bu).

iv) diazotization.

v) H2SO4.

vi) H3O+ → perhaps hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → perhaps substituting sulfonic acid with ethoxy.

So, after step iii, the ring has t-Bu (2), nitro (3), SO3H (1).

Then, steps iv and v: diazotization and H2SO4. Diazonium salt is formed from amine, but the ring doesn't have an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted to something else.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amine in step iv. But in option A, step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is for diazotization, not for reduction.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the steps again.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro via nitration, which goes into position 3.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution, but how? Perhaps by introducing a leaving group, such as a bromide, and then substituting with ethoxide.

But none of the options seem to directly fit.

Wait, in option A, after t-Bu and nitro, sulfonate is added (SO3 in position 1). Then, steps iv to vii involve diazotization, H2SO4, H3O+/heat, which could be hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group. Then, step vii: NaOH and EtBr would lead to substitution of the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.

Ah, wait, that makes sense. Let me see:

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu in 2.

ii) nitrate → nitro in 3.

iii) sulfonate → SO3H in 1.

iv) diazotization: but where is the amine? Maybe the nitro group is reduced in another step. Wait, no, step iv is NaNO2 and HCl, which is diazotization, but requires an amine. So, perhaps before step iv, the nitro group is reduced to an amine.

But in option A, steps are:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) sulfonate → SO3H.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → which would require an amine. So, perhaps step iii is followed by reduction of nitro to amine, but that's not in the steps of option A.

Wait, perhaps option A's step i is t-Bu, then step ii nitro, then iii sulfonate, then step iv is diazotization. But if the ring doesn't have an amine, that wouldn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck and have to make a choice. Based on the steps, I think option D is the right one because it adds nitro first, which is a meta director, allowing ethoxy and t-Bu to be added in the correct positions.

Wait, no. Option D starts with nitration, leading to nitro in position 1. Then, reduce to amine (step ii), then alkylation to add t-Bu in position 2. Then, nitration again (step iv), which would go to position 5. But target has nitro in 3, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the directing order again.

Wait, maybe the correct order is nitro first, then ethoxy, then t-Bu. Let me see.

But nitro is a meta director, so ethoxy would be added in position 4 (meta to nitro in 1). Then, t-Bu would be added in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). But that would give nitro in 1, ethoxy in 4, t-Bu in 2. That's not the target, which has nitro in 3.

I think I'm going to have to choose the option that best fits the target. After reviewing the options, I think option B is correct, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl (position 2), ethoxy (position 1), and nitro (position 3). The synthesis must ensure these substituents are added in the correct order to achieve the desired positions, considering the directing effects of each group.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Introduces tert-butyl at position 2.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration occurs ortho or para to tert-butyl. Nitro could end up at position 3, which is correct.
3. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group. This step may direct subsequent reactions.
4. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but no amine is present in the intermediate, making this step unclear.
5. **Dilute H2SO4**: Likely hydrolysis, but the role of this step is ambiguous.
6. **H3O+/H2O/Heat**: Acid workup, possibly for hydrolysis.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution reaction, potentially introducing the ethoxy group.
8. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction, but the target does not require reduction.
9. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, but the target already has one nitro group.

This sequence could theoretically introduce the substituents in the correct positions, but the role of sulfonation and subsequent steps is unclear.

#### **Option B**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Introduces tert-butyl at position 2.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration occurs ortho or para to tert-butyl. Nitro could end up at position 3, which is correct.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction, but the target does not require reduction.
4. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, but the target already has one nitro group.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but no amine is present in the intermediate, making this step unclear.
6. **H3O+/H2O/Heat**: Acid workup, but the role of this step is ambiguous.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution reaction, potentially introducing the ethoxy group.
8. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation, but the target does not require a sulfonic acid group.
9. **Dilute H2SO4**: Likely hydrolysis, but the role of this step is unclear.

This sequence introduces an additional nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Introduces tert-butyl at position 2.
2. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group. This step may direct subsequent reactions.
3. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration occurs meta to the sulfonic acid group. Nitro could end up at position 1, which is incorrect.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction, but the target does not require reduction.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but no amine is present in the intermediate, making this step unclear.
6. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, but the target already has one nitro group.
7. **H3O+/H2O/Heat**: Acid workup, but the role of this step is ambiguous.
8. **Dilute H2SO4**: Likely hydrolysis, but the role of this step is unclear.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution reaction, potentially introducing the ethoxy group.

This sequence places the nitro group incorrectly and introduces an additional nitro group, making it inconsistent with the target.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces a nitro group. Nitro could end up at position 1.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **t-BuCl/AlCl3**: Introduces tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to the amine).
4. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration. Nitro could end up at position 5, which is incorrect.
5. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, but no amine is present in the intermediate, making this step unclear.
6. **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation, but the target does not require a sulfonic acid group.
7. **Dilute H2SO4**: Likely hydrolysis, but the role of this step is unclear.
8. **H3O+/H2O/Heat**: Acid workup, but the role of this step is ambiguous.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution reaction, potentially introducing the ethoxy group.

This sequence introduces an additional nitro group and places it incorrectly, making it inconsistent with the target.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the most plausible sequence. It introduces tert-butyl first, followed by nitro in the correct position. The subsequent steps involving sulfonation, diazotization, and substitution with ethoxy align best with the target structure, despite some ambiguity in the exact roles of certain steps.
