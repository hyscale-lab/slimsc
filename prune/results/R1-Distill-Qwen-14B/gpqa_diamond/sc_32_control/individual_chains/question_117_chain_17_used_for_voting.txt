Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have chirality, meaning they have a center of asymmetry, like a chiral center. Also, sometimes it can be due to other factors like axial chirality or something else. 

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining some of the four. Let's take each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyls can exhibit optical isomerism if there's a possibility of the two phenyl rings being non-superimposable. But typically, biphenyls with substituents can have either a meso form or exhibit diastereomerism. Wait, but for biphenyls to have optical isomerism, the substituents need to be in certain positions. The positions here are 6,6' and 2,2'. So the substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, that's on each ring. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Wait, but the biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1'—so the two rings are connected in the 1 position. So the substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. So, the molecule is symmetrical? Wait, let me visualize. Each ring has two substituents: at 2 and 6. So on each ring, nitro at para to the connecting position, and the ester at ortho. So if I imagine the biphenyl, each ring has substituents in such a way that they might be symmetric. Wait, but if the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other on each ring? No, wait, 2 is ortho to the connecting bond, 6 is another position. Wait, maybe I should think about whether these substituents create a center of asymmetry or if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So let's see: the substituents are in positions that are symmetric across the central bond. So maybe each ring has substituents in positions that make the entire molecule symmetrical. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, meaning no optical isomerism. Or wait, maybe because the substituents are arranged in such a way that they create a chiral axis. Oh wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality. So when the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical around the central bond, then it can have optical isomerism. So in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me think: numbering on each ring, if the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6 (I think for biphenyl, the numbering goes 1,2,3,4,5,6 around each ring). So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, but on the same ring. Hmm, perhaps that creates a situation where the two rings are not symmetrical. So maybe the molecule can have enantiomers because the arrangement around the central bond is chiral. So this compound might exhibit optical isomerism. I'm not entirely sure, but I think this one does.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see: that's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (R)- and (S)-glyceraldehyde? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 as the ester. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methyl, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, wait, that's a secondary alcohol. So the central carbon is attached to OH, CH2COOCH3, another CH2, and the methyl ester? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. The correct structure is: the propanoate ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3 (from the CH2 group), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, let's get it right. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon: CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. But wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is actually (R)- and (S)-lactic acid. Wait, no, lactic acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So when you esterify it with methyl, it becomes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is methyl lactate. Now, does methyl lactate have a chiral center? The carbon where the OH is attached. Let me see: the central carbon has four different groups: OH, methyl ester (from the COOCH3), CH3 group (from the adjacent carbon), and another CH2 group? Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is actually CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; but the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH2_, and what else? Wait, perhaps it's CH(CH2COOCH3)(OH)(CH3). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as a three-carbon chain: the first carbon is CH3, the second is CH(OH), and the third is COOCH3. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible because that would be a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the propanoate has three carbons. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is attached to: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, let's count the bonds. Each carbon has four bonds. So the structure is CH(CH2OH)(CH2COOCH3)(something else?) No, perhaps I should think about the connectivity. The molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (the ester group)
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no. Let me try again. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the propanoate part is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So as an ester, it would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the central carbon is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another hydrogen? Wait, no, that would make it a chiral center. Because each of the four substituents is different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So yes, that's a chiral center. So this compound (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. So this one is definitely an optical isomer.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ar)C=O(Ar), where Ar is a phenyl group. So the structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The molecule is symmetrical because the two phenyl groups are identical. The central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's a planar structure. So it doesn't have any chiral centers, and since it's symmetrical, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So this one doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no: wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2CH with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Wait, no: fumaric acid is E, which is trans. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is CH2-C(=O)OCH3 and CH2-C(=O)OCH3 on the same double bond. Wait, no, wait: fumarate has the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, that's not right. No, fumaric acid is HO2C-CHCH2-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between the two central carbons. So the structure of fumarate is a trans configuration across the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl ester groups on the same side? Or opposite? Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups would be on the same side or opposite sides? Wait, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So when you esterify both with methyl, the two methyl ester groups would be on opposite sides. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry? Or is it chiral? Wait, no. If the groups are on opposite sides, but since each ester group is identical (both methyl), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in that case, it wouldn't be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so it doesn't have optical isomerism. But wait, what about the possibility of being a diastereomer? No, because the question is about optical isomerism, which is about enantiomers. So if the molecule is symmetrical, it can't have enantiomers. But wait, wait: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethylbutenedioate. Does it have a plane of symmetry? Let me draw it. The structure is:

CH2-C(=O)OCH3
|
C=C
|
CH2-C(=O)OCH3

But wait, in the E configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule would look like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C
       ||
       O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to C1
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to C2

In the E configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So it doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, so dimethyl maleate would have the two ester groups on the same side. Now, if the substituents are the same (both methyl), then whether the groups are on the same or opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate (E) would have symmetry, thus no optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the substituents were different, like one ester and one something else, then perhaps it could be chiral. So in this case, since both substituents are the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus no optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that if the substituents are the same on either side of the double bond, the molecule is not chiral. So for dimethyl fumarate, since the substituents are the same, it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, another possibility arises: sometimes, when the substituents are identical, the compound may not have optical isomerism because it's not chiral. So if that's correct, then dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a center of asymmetry. No, because in the E configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, but since they're identical, the molecule is symmetrical. So no, no optical isomerism here.

Wait, but wait, perhaps if the substituents are different, then the molecule would be chiral. But in this case, both substituents are methyl esters. So same substituents on each end. So the molecule is symmetrical. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So if I have two identical groups on each side of the double bond and the groups are opposite, then it's symmetrical. So the molecule can't be chiral.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro... I think this has axial chirality in the biphenyl structure, so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: has a chiral center, so yes.

3. Benzophenone: symmetrical, no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: symmetrical, no.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, dimethyl fumarate is (E) configuration. But in this case, the substituents are the same on either side. So the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond, so no optical isomerism.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, even with identical substituents, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So in the case of (E)-dimethyl fumarate, because the substituents are the same, it's symmetrical. So no optical isomerism. So 4 doesn't exhibit it.

So, which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

1: Yes.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So which options are correct? The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → but 4 doesn't, so no.

B) 3 and 4 → both no, so no.

C) 2 and 3 → no, because 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → yes.

Wait, but I thought 1 might have axial chirality. So, correct answers would be 1 and 2, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought about compound 1. Let's make sure.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'.

So on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Are the substituents in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry?

Let me try to imagine. Each ring has two substituents: one at 2 (ortho to the central bond) and another at 6 (para to the central bond). So, each ring's substituents are in positions that are ortho and para to the connecting bond.

Wait, but when the substituents are in such positions, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think: the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', and each has substituents at 2 and 6. So on each ring, substituents are at positions ortho and para to the bond. So the arrangement is such that each ring looks like 1 (connecting) with substituents at 2 and 6. So the two substituents on each ring are across from each other, but on the same ring. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond, leading to no axial chirality. Or perhaps it's not symmetrical. Wait, but if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are ortho and para, which are 1.5 and 3 positions away (in terms of numbering?). Maybe the arrangement is such that there's no symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two substituents on each ring that are in such positions that the overall structure is symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule does have a plane of symmetry. For example, the central bond (1-1') could have a mirror plane that reflects one substituent to the other.

Wait, but if the substituents are on each ring at 2 and 6, which are symmetric positions, then perhaps each ring is symmetrical. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So in that case, compound 1 wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but when I first thought, I thought that biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can have axial chirality. But perhaps in this case, the substituents are arranged symmetrically, so no chirality.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral.

But in this structure, each ring has two substituents. Let me imagine looking down the central bond of the biphenyl. Each ring has substituents on the same side. Or perhaps on opposite sides. Wait, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring: 2 is ortho to the central bond, 6 is para. So on each ring, the substituents are at positions that are 1 and 3 away from the central bond. So perhaps each ring is symmetrical, but when you look at the entire molecule, the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Another way to approach this is to think about whether the molecule is symmetrical or not. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, it won't be chiral. If not, it might be.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if one substituent is in one direction and the other is in a direction that doesn't mirror, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but without a clear image, it's difficult to tell. Another approach: perhaps I can think about the possibility of whether the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution pattern leads to a lack of symmetry. Let's say the substituents on one ring are at 2 and 6. On the other ring, substituents are also at 2 and 6. So each substituent is at the same position relative to the central bond on each ring. So if you have a mirror plane along the central bond, then substituents on one ring would mirror those on the other. So the molecule would be symmetrical. Therefore, it would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if that's the case, then compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So only compound 2 does.

But then looking back, earlier I thought that 1 and 2 are correct. But if 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, then only 2 does. So looking at the options:

Which option includes only 2?

The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2 but also 1 and 4, which I thought 4 doesn't.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no, 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → but if 1 doesn't, then this is incorrect.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should research (but since I can't, I'll have to think through). Biphenyls with substituents can exhibit axial chirality when the substituents are in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond.

In compound 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let's imagine each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, for each ring, substituents are at positions ortho (2) and para (6) relative to the central bond. So for each ring, the substituents are in positions that are symmetrical with respect to the central bond. So if you have a mirror plane down the central bond, each substituent would mirror the other. So the molecule would be symmetrical, hence no chirality.

So compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So only compound 2 does.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2.

B) 3,4 → no.

C) 2,3 → no.

D)1,2 → includes 2 and 1, which I think doesn't.

Wait, but in the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But I thought 4 doesn't. So perhaps I made a mistake about 4.

Wait, going back to compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is (E) isomer, so the two methyl ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But since both substituents are the same (methyl), the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But none of the options have only 2. So looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → if 1 is no, 4 is no, but 2 is yes → this option would be incorrect.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → no.

D) 1 and 2 → if 1 is no, then no.

Hmm, this is a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate each compound.

1. Let me think again. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the substituents on each ring are at positions that are symmetric relative to the central bond. So the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so yes.

3. Benzophenone is symmetrical, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate is (E), with same substituents on each side. So symmetrical, no.

So the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4. But that would imply that 1 and 4 show optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule is (E) and has same substituents, it's symmetrical. So no optical isomerism. So 4 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Maybe 1 does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think again.

In the biphenyl system, if the substituents are in positions that are not symmetrical, then the molecule can have axial chirality.

In 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So on each ring, the substituents are at the ortho and para positions. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other on that ring.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a twist, leading to axial chirality. So the biphenyl's substituents are arranged such that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, then the molecule is achiral.

But if the substituents are in positions that are not symmetric across the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

But in this case, the substituents on each ring are symmetric. For example, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has substituents at positions that are 1 and 3 away from the central bond. So, in a way, each ring is symmetrical about the central bond.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical. So no axial chirality.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should instead look for other ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, 4. But I thought 4 doesn't.

Wait, another approach: think about the possibility of E and Z isomerism in 4.

No, because 4 is an ester with identical substituents, so E and Z might not lead to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about 1. Maybe 1 is asymmetric.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they are not mirror images. So, for example, the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a non-symmetrical arrangement, leading to a chiral molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of asymmetry.

Wait, no, because the molecule is a biphenyl, which is a planar structure. Axial chirality arises when the substituents are attached to the biphenyl in a way that they can't be mirrored.

If each ring's substituents are arranged in a way that their positions create a twist, then the molecule can be chiral.

In this compound, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are on the same side relative to the central bond. Or perhaps on opposite sides. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl has substituents in such a way that they cannot be superimposed on their mirror images. So the molecule would have axial chirality, making it chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, summing up:

1: Yes.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So the correct compounds are 1 and 2, which is option D.

So, the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule has no plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) are arranged symmetrically across the central bond. This symmetry results in a plane of symmetry for the molecule, making it achiral. Therefore, it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. The central carbon (bearing the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, CH2COOCH3, OH, and H. This creates a chiral center, making the molecule capable of optical isomerism. Thus, it **does** exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ar)C=O(Ar), where Ar is a phenyl group. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl group. This symmetry prevents chirality, so it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Fumaric acid is the (E)-isomer of butenedioic acid, meaning the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. However, since both substituents are identical (methyl groups), the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 does **not** exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.  
- Compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compound 3 does **not** exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.  
- Compound 4 does **not** exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.  

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **2**. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **D**, which includes compounds 1 and 2, but compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism. Despite this inconsistency, **D** is the closest match to the reasoning.

Answer: D
