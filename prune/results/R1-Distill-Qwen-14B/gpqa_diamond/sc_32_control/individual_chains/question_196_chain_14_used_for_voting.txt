Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I have to consider special relativity effects, probably involving the Lorentz factor or something like that.

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since it's relativistic, the energies are probably related through the relativistic energy equations.

Let me think. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? And the maximum kinetic energy would be the same when the mass is at the equilibrium position. So the non-relativistic max speed would be sqrt(kA²/m). But relativistically, energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the total energy E of a particle in special relativity is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this case, the oscillator's total energy comes from both rest mass and the potential energy at maximum displacement.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy: E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Hmm, is that right? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy, so E = gamma mc², and at the maximum displacement, all the energy would be potential, so E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Wait, no, actually, the rest energy is mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, but wait. When the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, the kinetic energy is zero, so all the energy is potential. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum, so the total energy is all kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So setting E = (gamma - 1)mc² equal to (1/2)kA²?

Wait, no, because E is the total energy, which is gamma mc². So in that case, E would be gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA². So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²). Hmm, because (1/2)kA² is added to the rest energy.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, (1/2)kA² is the potential energy, which would equal the maximum kinetic energy (1/2)mv², leading to v= sqrt(kA²/m). So in that case, the non-relativistic answer would be option C, which is one of the choices. But since we're in the relativistic case, the maximum speed must be less than c, but the options include c multiplied by something, so maybe it's larger than c? Wait, that can't be because nothing can go faster than light. So perhaps the options involving c are using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is similar to the relativistic harmonic oscillator, where the energy is quantized but in this case, maybe it's treated classically.

Wait, let me think differently. The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is a bit different. The restoring force is F = -kx, but in relativity, momentum isn't just mv. The momentum p is gamma m v. So the equation of motion would involve the relativistic momentum.

The equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator in relativity might be d(p)/dt = -kx. Since p = gamma m v, and dp/dt = m d(gamma v)/dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps energy considerations are better. The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, and at the maximum displacement, all energy is potential. So E_total = (1/2) k A² + m c². When the mass is at the equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic, so E_total = gamma m c². Therefore, gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Subtract m c² from both sides: gamma m c² - m c² = (1/2)k A².

Factor out m c²: m c² (gamma - 1) = (1/2)k A².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a small term, but maybe it's not negligible. Let's set a variable, say, alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me solve for v. Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranged:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Factor that:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor out alpha in numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute back.

v² = c² [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Simplify numerator:

= c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Let me factor this step by step.

Let me write (k A²)/(2 m c²) as beta for simplicity.

So beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, v² = c² [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= c² beta (2 + beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

We can factor numerator and denominator:

= c² [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

We can write 2 + beta as (1 + beta) + 1.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor beta.

Wait, let me write 2 + beta = 2(1) + beta = 2(1 + beta/2). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps make a substitution. The denominator is (1 + beta)^2. Let me expand the numerator:

beta (2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta².

So,

v² = c² [ (2 beta + beta²) ) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Factor beta:

= c² beta (2 + beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, perhaps that's as simplified as it gets. Let me see if any of the options match this form.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Wait, not sure. Let me compute each option.

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, denominator in the fraction is (1 - (kA^2)/(2m) )^2, but our expression has terms with (kA^2)/(2 m c^2). So perhaps none of the options directly match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I should think in terms of energy again. Let me think about the expression I derived.

v² = c² * [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2,

where beta = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

Let me factor beta:

= c² beta (2 + beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

= c² beta [ (2 + beta) ] / ( (1 + beta)^2 )

But perhaps it's better to expand this.

Alternatively, perhaps express it in terms of gamma.

Wait, from earlier, gamma = 1 + beta.

Wait, no, beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²), and gamma = 1 + beta.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can write 2 + beta = 2 + (gamma -1) ) since beta = gamma -1.

Wait, gamma = 1 + beta → beta = gamma -1.

So,

2 + beta = 2 + gamma -1 = gamma +1.

So,

v² = c² * ( (gamma -1) (gamma + 1) ) / gamma².

Because (1 + beta)^2 is (gamma)^2.

Because beta = gamma -1 → 1 + beta = gamma.

So, denominator is gamma squared.

So,

v² = c² * ( (gamma² - 1) ) / gamma².

Because (gamma-1)(gamma+1) = gamma² -1.

So,

v² = c² (gamma² -1) / gamma².

Taking square root,

v = c * sqrt( (gamma² -1)/gamma² )

= c * sqrt( 1 - 1/gamma² )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe I should express 1 - v²/c² in terms of gamma.

Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma^2.

Wait, earlier we had:

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = (1 + beta)^2.

Which implies that 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2.

But beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ]

Which can be written as:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ) ]

Let me compute the numerator:

(1 + x)^2 -1 = 1 + 2x + x² -1 = 2x + x².

So,

v² = c² (2x + x²) / (1 + x)^2, where x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which brings us back to where we were earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I should look again at the options.

Looking at option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, let's see:

If I have v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 ].

Then,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ] )

Which is the same as sqrt( c² (1 - 1/(1 + x)^2) ), where x is the term.

So that would make v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + x)^2 -1 ] / (1 +x)^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2x + x²)/ (1 +x)^2 )

Which is the same as v² = c² * (2x +x²)/(1 +x)^2.

So which option matches this form?

Looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²) ))^2 )

Which is the same as what we have, because 1 - [1/(1 + x)^2 ] = ( (1 +x)^2 -1 )/(1 +x)^2 ) = (2x +x²)/(1 +x)^2.

So the expression under the sqrt is (2x +x²)/(1 +x)^2.

But in any case, looking at the options, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²) )^2 )) → Wait, no, the denominator is (1 + ... ) squared, right? Let me check.

Wait, option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

Wait, no, actually, the phrasing in option D is 1 - 1/(1 + ... ), so it's sqrt of that.

So yes, that's exactly what we have.

Wait, but wait, our expression is v = c * sqrt( [ (2x +x²) ] / (1+x)^2 ), where x is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Which can be written as sqrt( (x(2 +x))/(1 +x)^2 ) * c.

But option D is sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +x)^2 ), which is the same as sqrt( ( (1 +x)^2 -1 )/(1 +x)^2 ) ) which is sqrt( (x(2 +x) )/(1 +x)^2 ), same as our expression.

So option D is the same as our result.

Wait, but wait, let me look again at the options:

Option D says: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2 ), which is the same as our expression.

So perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: c*sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m) )^2 )

That's different because the denominator is (1 - (kA²/(2m) ))^2, but our terms involve (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So it's a different expression.

Option B: c*sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, no, the denominator is (1 - (kA²/(2 m c²) )).

So that's a different denominator and without squaring. So Option B seems incorrect.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which is correct for small A where relativistic effects are negligible.

But the question is about the relativistic case, so option C is probably not the right choice.

Option D looks correct based on the derivation.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the energy approach.

Total energy E = (1/2)k A² + mc².

When the mass is at maximum displacement, it's all potential energy.

At maximum speed, when x=0, all energy is kinetic, which in relativity is (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which can be written as gamma = 1 + x, where x is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x.

Which leads to sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 +x).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 +x)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 +x)^2.

Which is the same as,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 ].

Which is what option D says, because x is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So yes, option D is the correct answer.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we consider the relativistic energy relationship. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is expressed in terms of the relativistic kinetic energy:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for total energy:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Factoring out \( mc^2 \):

\[
mc^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy relationship or incorrectly handle the terms involving \( c^2 \) in the denominator.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A:** Incorrect because the denominator involves \( (1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m})^2 \), which does not account for the relativistic factor \( c^2 \).
- **Option B:** Incorrect because the denominator involves \( (1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}) \), which is not squared, leading to an incorrect expression.
- **Option C:** This is the non-relativistic result, \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), which does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D:** Correct, as it matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) in the relativistic case.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Answer: D
