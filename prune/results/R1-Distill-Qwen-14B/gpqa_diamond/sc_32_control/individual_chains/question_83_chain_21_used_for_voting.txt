Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can be a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with two pH values. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, let me outline what I need to do. I think I should start by figuring out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, during the titration, I'll need to consider how much NaOH is added and calculate the pH at 25% and at equivalence.

Wait, but let me break it down step by step. 

First, the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 liters). So the concentration after dilution would be (M1V1)/(V_total) = (0.05 M * 0.020 L)/0.040 L. Let me calculate that.

So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. So 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted to 0.04 L, the concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait. 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 mol. Then, 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

So now, we're titrating this 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. Let me find out the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. 

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Or wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 20+20=40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Right.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So first, the pH at 25% titration. Let's think about this. Since it's 25% of the way to the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer. Because some of the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH, producing acetate ions. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Wait, but let's make sure. So when we add NaOH to acetic acid, the OH- will react with the acetic acid (which is a weak acid) to form acetate and water.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, initially, before any NaOH is added, the solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. At 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 0.25 times the equivalence point, so we can calculate the moles.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO- formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, both are in the same solution volume. The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO- = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL → 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

Let me calculate that. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26.

Looking at the options, the first number in option A is 4.26. So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me get exact numbers.

Moles of NaOH added: 2.5 cm³ × 0.1 mol/cm³ = 0.25 mmol? Wait wait, no, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol, which is 0.25 mmol. Because 1 mole is 1000 mmol, so 0.00025 mol = 0.25 mmol.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol.

So after adding 0.25 mmol of NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH are 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 mmol, and moles of CH3COO- are 0.25 mmol.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.75 mmol / 42.5 mL = (0.75/42.5) M.

Wait, 0.75 mmol is 0.00075 mol, so 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Similarly, [CH3COO-] = 0.25 mmol / 42.5 mL = 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is (0.005882) / (0.017647) = 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So the first part of the answer is around 4.26.

Now, the second part is the pH at equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

So the solution will consist of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) in solution. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will dissociate completely, and the acetate comes from a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So, the acetate concentration at equivalence point is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid divided by the total volume.

Wait, let's calculate the moles. Acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol. At equivalence, all of it is converted to acetate, so 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.

The total volume is initial volume (40 mL) + volume of NaOH at equivalence (10 mL) → 50 mL or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

We can model this as Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH-] produced, then:

Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 M. pH is 14 - pOH.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈ 14 -4.98=9.02.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 1.04e-5 → the log of 1.04 is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is 0.017 -5 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983, pH is 14-4.983=9.017, so approximately 9.02.

But wait, looking at the options, none of the options have a pH of around 9.02 at equivalence. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733.

So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb is 5.405e-10.

Let me use the approximation that x is small compared to 0.02, so x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. Wait, wait, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is about 3.16e-6. So 1.081e-11 is a bit more. Let me compute sqrt(1.081e-11).

So sqrt(1.081) is approx 1.04, so 1.04e-5.5 → 1.04e-5.5 → wait, 1e-5 is 1e-5, 1e-6 is 0.1e-5. So 1e-5.5 is about 3.16e-6. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6. So [OH-] is 3.28e-6 M.

Wait, that's different from what I said earlier. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation before. Let me recompute.

Wait, 1.081e-11:

x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11).

Let me calculate sqrt(1.081e-11). Let me write it as 1.081 × 1e-11.

sqrt(1.081) ≈ 1.04, so sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 which is 3.16e-6.

So 1.04 × 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.2864e-6 M. So [OH-] = 3.2864e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.2864e-6) → log(3.2864) is about 0.516, so log(3.2864e-6) is 0.516 -6 = -5.484 → pOH is 5.484.

So pH = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516, approximately 8.52.

Ah! So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → the first part matches, and this is the equivalence pH.

But wait, I thought earlier that the equivalence pH would be around 9.02, but now it's 8.52. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10, which is correct.

So the Kb is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I got the acetate concentration wrong. Let me recheck: at equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 mL → 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So, with [A-] =0.02 M, Kb=5.405e-10.

So Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] → assuming x << 0.02, then x^2 = Kb * [A-] → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Let me compute this.

log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) ≈ 0.5168 -6 → -5.4832.

pOH is 5.4832 → pH =14 -5.4832 =8.5168, so about 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct pair would be (4.26, 8.52), which is option A.

Wait, but wait, I'm looking at the options again. Let me check all options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D: 4.57;6.92.

Hmm, so according to this, option A would be the correct one. But wait, another thought: when you dilute acetic acid, its pH increases a bit, but then when titrated, the buffer region's pH is determined by the Henderson equation.

Wait, but wait, the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, which is weaker than 0.05 M, so the pH should be higher than before. Wait, but the initial pH I calculated for 25% titration is 4.26. But wait, before any titration, the pH would be lower, right? Because when you dilute a weak acid, it dissociates more, so pH increases. So initial pH of the diluted solution would be higher than that of the undiluted solution.

But in any case, the question is about when 25% of the titration is done, so we're dealing with a buffer solution.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. Did I make a mistake in the stoichiometry?

Another approach is to calculate the concentrations at 25% titration correctly.

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, which is 25% of the 10 cm³ needed for equivalence. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So moles of acetic acid reacting: 0.00025 mol, so remaining: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 mL +2.5 mL=42.5 mL→0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] =0.00025 /0.0425 =0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is about 0.005882 /0.017647 = 0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → pKa is 4.733, log(0.3333)= -0.477, so pH is 4.733 -0.477 =4.256, which is about 4.26.

So that's correct.

At equivalence, pH is about 8.52, so option A seems correct.

But looking at the options again, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, another thought: when the solution is at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate, which is a weak base. So the solution should be basic, which aligns with pH 8.52, which is indeed basic.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, containing 0.001 mol of acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L), resulting in a concentration of:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, and since NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio, the moles of NaOH required for equivalence are also 0.001 mol. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (0.00025 mol) has been added. The reaction between NaOH and acetic acid produces 0.00025 mol of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) and leaves 0.00075 mol of acetic acid (CH₃COOH). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} = 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{mol}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.050 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Let \([OH⁻] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([OH⁻]) = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH values at 25% titration and at the equivalence point are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option A: 4.26; 8.52.**

Answer: A
