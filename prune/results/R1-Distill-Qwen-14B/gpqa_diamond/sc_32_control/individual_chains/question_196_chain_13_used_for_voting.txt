Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, so we're dealing with relativistic effects here.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Since the question is relativistic, that approach might not hold.

So, relativistic considerations come into play when the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The harmonic oscillator's equation of motion in relativity isn't the same as in Newtonian physics. I think the relativistic harmonic oscillator equation is different because the forces depend on velocity in a more complicated way.

In classical mechanics, the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². The total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA². At maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, which gives the maximum speed.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, maybe the setup is that the oscillator's potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy includes relativistic effects. So the total energy E would include both, but E is also equal to gamma mc². So, at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So E = gamma mc² = K + U. But wait, when x=0, U is zero, so E = K = gamma mc² - mc². Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Actually, the total energy for the oscillator is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma mc². At maximum amplitude (x=A), the oscillator is at rest (in terms of velocity, v=0), so all energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy is also E = gamma mc². So setting them equal: gamma mc² = (1/2)kA². Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when x=A, v is zero, so gamma is 1, so E = mc². So (1/2)k A² = mc²? That can't be right because for large A, k could be small, but mc² is a huge value.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the potential energy in the relativistic case is treated differently. Or perhaps the equation of motion is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's equation combines relativistic momentum. Let me think. The force in relativity is F = d(momentum)/dt. Momentum is gamma m v. So F = d/dt (gamma m v).

For a harmonic oscillator, F = -kx. So the equation of motion is m gamma v' = -k x. But this gets complicated because x and v are related, and gamma involves v.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy is the sum of rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy. So the total energy E is gamma mc², which should equal the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is (1/2)kA².

Wait, but for non-relativistic cases, E is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv²_max. So in the relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA² but also E = gamma mc².

So setting them equal: gamma mc² = (1/2)k A².

So gamma = (k A²) / (2 m c²). Wait, but gamma is always greater than or equal to 1, so (k A²)/(2 m c²) must be >=1. But that would require k A² >= 2 m c². Hmm, I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of when the oscillator is at maximum displacement. At x = A, velocity is zero, so the total energy is just potential energy, which is (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the total energy is also the rest energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, if velocity is zero, the kinetic energy is zero. So E = mc². So, (1/2)k A² = mc²? That doesn't make sense because (1/2)kA² is usually much smaller than mc². So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the relativistic kinetic energy but is a different model. Maybe it's a relativistic correction to the equation of motion. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is (d^2 x/dt^2) + (k/m) x = (k/m) (gamma -1 ) something? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use conservation of energy. At maximum displacement x=A, velocity is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point, x=0, velocity is maximum. So the energy is all kinetic, which in relativity is (gamma -1) mc². So, (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

So, solving for gamma: gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2).

Hmm, but that seems a bit tricky to solve for v_max. Let's square both sides:

gamma² = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]² = 1/(1 - v_max^2/c^2).

So,

1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Rearranging,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Which can be rewritten as:

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ].

Hmm, that's getting somewhere. Let me compute this expression. Let's let (k A²)/(2 m c²) = q. Then,

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + q )^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + q)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + q )^2 )

= c² [ (1 + 2 q + q² - 1 ) / (1 + q )^2 )

= c² [ (2 q + q² ) / (1 + q )^2 ]

= c² [ q (2 + q ) / (1 + q )^2 ]

But q is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so plugging back in,

v_max^2 = c² [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) / ( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ) ]

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe it's better to factor terms differently. Let me see.

Alternatively, let's express 1 - (v^2/c^2) as 1/(gamma^2). So from gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), we have:

gamma = 1 + q, where q = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1/(1 + q)^2 = 1 - v²/c².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+q)^2.

= [ (1+q)^2 -1 ] / (1+q)^2.

= [ 1 + 2 q + q² -1 ] / (1+q)^2.

= (2 q + q² )/(1+q)^2.

= q (2 + q ) / (1+q)^2.

Wait, but perhaps this isn't leading me to any of the given options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/( (1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 ) )

Hmm, that seems to have a term without the c in denominator, which might not fit.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Hmm, denominator is 1 - something with c², which might fit with my earlier approach.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A² / m ), which is the classical non-relativistic case.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

So, let's see.

From earlier, I have v² = c² [ (2 q + q² ) / (1 + q )^2 ] where q = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me compute (2 q + q²) and (1 + q)^2.

2 q = 2 (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = (k A²)/(m c² )

q² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So, numerator becomes [ (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Denominator is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 = [ 2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Wait, maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me think about gamma again.

We have gamma = 1 + q, where q = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

We can write this as gamma = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / ( 2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + [k A²/(2 m c²)].

Then, gamma squared is [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ] / [ (2 m c² )^2 ]

But gamma squared is 1/(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ] / [ (2 m c² )^2 ]

Then,

1 - v²/c² = [ (2 m c² )^2 ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

= [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 - (2 m c² )^2 ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2

Expanding numerator:

(2 m c² +kA²)^2 = [ (2 m c²)^2 + 2*(2 m c²)(k A²) + (k A²)^2 ]

So,

Numerator becomes:

[ (2 m c²)^2 + 4 m c² k A² + (k A²)^2 ) ] - (2 m c²)^2

= 4 m c² k A² + (k A²)^2

Factor numerator:

= k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A² (4 m c² + k A²)] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps it's better to factor out terms. Let me factor 4 m c² from the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² (1) + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² (1) + k A² )^2 = (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, maybe I can factor 4 m c^2 as (2 m c^2)*2.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as k A² [ (2 m c^2)*2 + k A^2 ]

= k A² [ 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let me see what the options look like.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2. Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as q again. So, option D is c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + q )^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( [ (1 + q )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + q )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [1 + 2q + q^2 -1 ] / (1+q)^2 )

= c * sqrt( ( 2 q + q^2 ) / (1+q)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ q (2 + q ) ] ) / (1 + q )

Which is c * sqrt( q (2 + q ) ) / (1 + q )

But earlier, I had:

v_max^2 = c² [ (2 q + q^2 ) / (1 + q )^2 ]

Which would make v_max = c * sqrt( [2 q + q² ] ) / (1 + q )

Wait, but the option D is c * sqrt( (2 q + q^2) ) / (1 + q )

Wait, comparing to what I have:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 q + q^2) ) / ( (1 + q ) )

Which is the same as option D, because option D is sqrt(1 - 1/(1+q)^2 ) times c.

So,

sqrt (1 - 1/(1+q)^2 ) = sqrt( [ ( (1+q)^2 -1 ) / (1+q)^2 ) ]

= sqrt( (2 q + q² ) / (1+q )^2 )

= sqrt(2 q + q^2 ) / (1 + q )

So, option D's expression is indeed equal to v_max.

Wait, but let me go back. Earlier, I thought that at x=A, E is (1/2)k A^2, which is equal to gamma mc^2. But wait, that's not correct because gamma at x=A is 1 (since v=0). So gamma mc^2 is mc^2, which would mean (1/2)k A^2 = mc^2. But that's only possible if k is very large or A is large, which might not be the case.

Hmm, wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the total energy is (1/2)k A^2. Because in relativity, the potential energy might have a different expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is treated classically, and the kinetic energy is relativistic. Wait, but the potential energy is U = (1/2)k x^2. So, the total energy E would be equal to U plus the relativistic kinetic energy. But when x = A, v is zero, so kinetic energy is zero (since in relativity, KE is (gamma -1) mc^2). So E = (1/2)k A^2. But when x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma -1 ) mc^2.

So,

(1/2)k A^2 = (gamma -1 ) mc^2.

Which gives,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/( 2 m c^2 )

Which is what I had earlier. So, that approach was correct.

So, from this, we get:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

1/ sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Which is the expression in option D.

Wait, but option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches exactly what I have.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but I should check the other options again to make sure.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, let's see what that gives. Let me compute the term inside the sqrt.

1 + 1/(1 - q ), where q = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 - q ) +1 ] / (1 - q )

= (2 - q )/(1 - q )

Which would give v = c * sqrt( (2 - q)/(1 - q) )

Hmm, but this doesn't match what I derived earlier.

So, given that, I'm confident that option D is the correct one.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy relationships. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the oscillator's velocity is zero, and all energy is potential energy, \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic, and the total energy is \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy relationships and the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).
