Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So the question is about a genetic construct and expression in mice. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with two genes: the ligand and the receptor. Both are under certain promoters and have stop cassettes. They used Cre to recombine these, probably to express the genes in specific tissues.

The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand uses the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. So, the vector is designed to express two proteins from one transcript.

The stop cassettes are loxP-stop-loxP for the ligand and lox2272-stop-lox2272 for the receptor. When Cre is present, it should delete the stop cassettes. The ligand's stop cassette uses loxP, which Cre recognizes, and the receptor's uses lox2272, which a different Cre variant might recognize, but maybe in this case, it's the same Cre.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte cultures and used Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. But in the mouse model, they crossed the homozygous construct with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so probably the Cre is active there, recombining the lox sites.

So after the offspring are born, they look for green (eGFP) under the microscope but see nothing. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression? The eGFP is part of the receptor construct. If the receptor isn't expressed, eGFP wouldn't show. But the issue is about expression, not function. Maybe the expression is still okay, but the construct isn't being processed correctly.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor can't traffic properly, the GFP wouldn't be on the cell surface. But why would that happen? The vector design probably places the signal peptide for secretion or membrane localization. But without knowing more about the construct, I can't say for sure. But this option is about proper trafficking.

C) Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The promoters are CBA (for ligand) and IRES (for receptor). If the enhancers are missing, the promoters might not be strong enough. But wait, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after IRES, which is internal ribosome entry siteâ€”used for coexpression. So if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the mouse model is homozygous, so the construct is present. Wait, in the question, the vector is a bicistronic construct with CBA promoter driving ligand, then IRES, then receptor. So the enhancers would be part of the promoters. If the enhancer is missing, both might not be expressed. But the question says the vector is correctly made. Unless the enhancer is something else missing, like tissue-specific enhancers.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, that could be a problem. If the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Because when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor ORF and eGFP are joined. If they're not in frame, the eGFP might not be translated correctly, leading to no fluorescence.

Wait, looking at the vector: the ligand is at 5', then stop cassette, then mCherry. Then after that, the receptor is at 3', with eGFP. Hmm, no, the vector has the ligand and the receptor in the same transcript, separated by IRES. So the first ORF is ligand, then IRES, then receptor.

Wait, the vector is described as bicistronic, so it's one transcript with two ORFs. The first ORF is ligand, under CBA promoter. Then IRES, then receptor. So the ligand is fused to mCherry, but wait, no. The question says the ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Or is it that the ligand is under CBA, then after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), and then the receptor ORF, which is under IRES?

Wait, let me re-read the setup:

The vector is bicistronic lox-Cre. Ligand ORF at 5', fused to mCherry. Receptor ORF at 3', fused to eGFP C-terminus. So the transcript would be ligand-mCherry followed by... but that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's a single transcript where the ligand is first, then the receptor is after the IRES.

Wait, the question says: Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ligand is cloned in such a way that after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette. Then the receptor is after the IRES, with its own stop cassette (lox2272). So when Cre is present, it recombines the stop cassettes, leading to expression of both ligand and receptor.

Wait, but how does the IRES work here. The IRES is between the ligand and receptor ORFs. So the idea is that the CBA promoter drives the transcription of both ligand and receptor. The first ORF is ligand, which is under CBA. After ligand comes the stop cassette. Then, the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the second ORF, which is the receptor.

Wait, but the stop cassette between ligand and mCherry is loxP. So with Cre, that stop is removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed. But how is mCherry involved? Oh, wait. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is expressed with eGFP at the C-terminus.

So, when the Cre is active, it deletes the loxP stop cassette before the ligand, so ligand-mCherry is expressed. And deletes the lox2272 stop cassette after the receptor, so the receptor-eGFP is expressed.

But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the Cre should delete the stop cassettes, allowing ligand and receptor to be expressed.

In the Western blot, they tested expression, which worked. So the construct is expressed in astrocytes, but in the mouse, they're looking for eGFP in the offspring. So why isn't eGFP showing?

Hmm. The mouse is homozygous for the construct, so each allele has the bicistronic vector. The SOX10-Cre is hemizygous, so when they cross, the offspring should have the construct and Cre.

But the problem is that eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause a frameshift, so eGFP isn't made. But the receptors ORF is correctly cloned. Unless during the vector construction, the eGFP was not in frame with the receptor.

Wait, the vector was designed with the receptor ORF at the 3', fused to eGFP. So the receptor ORF is in frame with eGFP? If the cloning caused a frameshift, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot showed the proteins were expressed. Wait, the Western blot was done on primary astrocyte culture. So in vitro, the construct was expressed. So why not in the mouse?

Wait, no. Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So the plasmid was expressed in vitro, and the proteins were detected. But in the mouse, the construct is integrated into the genome. Perhaps the expression is under different conditions. Or perhaps the issue isn't with expression but with the frames.

Wait, another thought: the vector uses loxP and lox2272. Cre from SOX10-Cre would recognize loxP. But lox2272 is a different recombinase site, which is recognized by a different Cre variant, like Dre or another recombinase. So if the stop cassette for the receptor is lox2272, and the Cre used is only Cre (which doesn't recognize lox2272), then the receptor's stop cassette isn't removed. So the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but in the question, the mouse is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre would recombine loxP sites but not lox2272. So the ligand's stop is loxP, so the ligand would be expressed (since Cre deletes it). But the receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor wouldn't be expressed. Hence, the eGFP isn't made, so no green signal.

Wait, but the question says between the receptor ORF and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop cassette, which is lox2272. So to express the receptor, the stop needs to be removed. But since the Cre used is only for loxP, the lox2272 wouldn't be cut. Hence, the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't visible.

So looking at the options, option C is about enhancer missing, which I don't think is the case because the CBA promoter is strong. Option B is about the receptor stuck in Golgi, but the problem is whether the receptor is expressed at all. If the stop isn't removed, the receptor isn't made.

Wait, but the question says the vector is designed with ligand under CBA, and the receptor after IRES. Wait, no, because the IRES is after the ligand's stop cassette. So the IRES is part of the second ORF's expression.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry is loxP, so when Cre is present, that stop is removed, allowing the ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The receptor is after the IRES, with its own stop cassette (lox2272). So if that stop isn't removed, the receptor isn't expressed.

So, the Cre used (from SOX10) can only remove loxP sites. The receptor's stop is lox2272, so Cre can't remove it. Therefore, the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't present.

So the reason for no green signal is that the receptor's stop cassette isn't removed because the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Therefore, the receptor isn't expressed.

Looking back at the options, none of them directly state this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Ligand and receptor in paracrine. Doesn't explain the lack of eGFP.

Option B: Receptor stuck in Golgi. That would affect trafficking, but we wouldn't know until the protein is made. But if the stop isn't removed, the protein isn't made in the first place.

Option C: Enhancer missing. If the enhancer was missing, expression might be low, but in the Western blot, expression was confirmed in vitro. So probably not.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if that's the case, the in vitro expression would also fail. But the question says the Western blot worked, so this is less likely.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the in vitro expression worked, the in vivo didn't. So the issue is in the in vivo construct.

So the problem is the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being removed because the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. But the options don't directly state that.

Wait, another thought: the vector uses a bicistronic design with an IRES. So the first ORF is ligand, with a stop, and the second is receptor, with eGFP. But IRES allows the ribosome to translate the second ORF. So if the stop cassette is in between, you might have a read-through issue. Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly allowing both genes to be expressed.

Wait, but the setup said the ligand and receptor are in a bicistronic vector with CBA promoter and IRES. The IRES-driven expression of the receptor would not require the stop cassette to be removed. Wait, no. If the ligand has a stop after it, then the IRES would allow translation of the receptor regardless of the stop. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the stop cassette is after the ligand, so that the ligand-mCherry is expressed when the stop is removed. The receptor is after the IRES, so it would be expressed regardless of the stop? Or wait, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand's ORF, but before the receptor's. So the stop cassette is between the ligand and the IRES? Or is it after the ligand?

Wait, let me reconstruct the vector. The vector is bicistronic. The first part is ligand ORF under CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP). Then comes the IRES. After IRES, the receptor ORF is present, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no. Because the question says the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So the ligand is cloned with mCherry. Then, after the ligand ORF, a stop cassette (loxP) is present. Then comes the IRES, then the receptor ORF, which is fused to eGFP. So the structure is: CBA promoter -> ligand (with mCherry) -> stop (loxP) -> IRES -> receptor (with eGFP) -> stop (lox2272).

So the first gene is ligand-mCherry, under CBA. The second gene is receptor-eGFP, under IRES.

In that case, when Cre is present, the loxP stop is removed, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272 stop is present after the receptor, so if that's not removed, the receptor won't be expressed.

But the Cre present in the SOX10-Cre mice can only cut loxP. So the lox2272 stop remains, and the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

But looking at the options, none of them directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the stop cassettes are not correctly placed. Wait, another possibility: the IRES is between the ligand and receptor, so the IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed without the stop being removed. But the presence of the stop (lox2272) after the receptor would prevent its expression unless the stop is removed.

Wait, but the stop is after the receptor, so the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed even if the stop is present. Or does the stop interfere with the IRES?

Hmm, perhaps the presence of the stop cassette after the receptor's ORF prevents the expression of the receptor. So the stop is in frame after the receptor, so the ribosome would terminate translation, preventing the expression of eGFP. Therefore, unless the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

So in the mouse, since the Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop, the stop remains, and the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. So the green signal isn't seen.

But looking back at the options, the only one that comes close is option C, which says the enhancer is missing. But I don't think that's the case, because the promoters are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working properly. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor should be expressed even if the ligand's stop is present. Wait, no. If the ligand has a stop, but after that comes the IRES and receptor, then the IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed regardless of the ligand's stop.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The vector is a bicistronic construct. The first ORF is ligand (under CBA), followed by a stop cassette (loxP). Then IRES, then the receptor (with eGFP), followed by a stop cassette (lox2272).

So in the presence of Cre, the loxP stop is removed, allowing ligand to be expressed. The lox2272 stop remains unless a different Cre (like Dre) is present. So the receptor's stop isn't removed, so it's not expressed. Hence, no eGFP.

Which of the options matches that?

Looking at the options, none of the options directly say that the stop is not removed because Cre can't recognize it. So perhaps the answer is option C, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame.

Wait, option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the cloning caused the eGFP to be out of frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the Western blot, if the receptor isn't made, then the eGFP wouldn't show either. But the Western blot was done on the plasmid-transfected cells, which showed expression. So in vitro, the construct works, but in vivo, it doesn't.

If the issue is that the stop after the receptor isn't removed, then the receptor isn't expressed. So the problem is that the lox2272 stop can't be cut by Cre, so the stop remains. Therefore, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that directly states this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, but that doesn't fit with the Western blot result.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette isn't the issue, but the IRES isn't working. But the IRES is supposed to allow the second ORF to be expressed.

Wait, another possibility: the stop cassette is in the middle of the ORF, not after. But the question states that between the ligand ORF and mCherry is the stop, which would disrupt the ligand expression. But since the stop is flanked by loxP, Cre would delete it, allowing the ligand to be expressed.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe the answer is option D. Because if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would it work in vitro but not in vivo? Because in vitro, the construct is transiently transfected, perhaps the plasmid is expressed without the stop, but in the mouse, the construct is integrated and the cell's machinery may not process it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't the issue, but the eGFP is in the wrong reading frame.

Wait, the plasmid works in vitro: Western blot shows expression. So the construct is correctly expressed when transfected. But in the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening. So maybe the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame, but that would affect in vitro as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is under a different promoter. Wait, no, the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand.

I'm not entirely sure, but based on the stop cassettes, the most likely reason is that the receptor's stop isn't removed because Cre can't recognize lox2272. Therefore, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. But none of the options directly state this.

Looking again, perhaps the enhancer is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter might not work in the mouse tissue, but the question says the vector was used in primary astrocytes, which worked. So perhaps the enhancer is present.

Hmm. Another angle: the IRES is only functional in certain cell types. If the IRES isn't active in the mouse tissue, the receptor won't be expressed. But in the Western blot, the construct was expressed in astrocytes, so the IRES works there.

Wait, but maybe in the mouse, the IRES isn't active. So the receptor isn't expressed. But why would that be? The IRES should function regardless of cell type, as it's a viral 2A peptide or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES is after the ligand's stop, and without the stop being removed, the IRES can't function. But no, the IRES is part of the second ORF. So if the receptor is after the IRES, and the stop is after that, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed regardless of the ligand's stop.

Wait, maybe the presence of the ligand's stop (which isn't removed) somehow disrupts the IRES. But that seems unlikely.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but considering all of this, the most plausible option is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't there. So the correct answer isn't listed, but looking at the options, perhaps option D is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: the vector has the ligand and receptor in the same direction. If the lox2272 stop isn't removed, the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why isn't the stop removed? Because the Cre used can't cut lox2272. So the Cre is Cre, which only recognizes loxP.

Thus, the stop remains, and the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly state this. So perhaps the answer is option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But that doesn't fit because the promoters are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. So in the vector, the ORF for receptor is followed by eGFP, but perhaps during cloning, the frame was shifted, leading to no eGFP expression.

But in the Western blot, they saw expression. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being translated, but the receptor is. But the Western blot was tested against both proteins, so if the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is, the blot would show the receptor but not eGFP. But the question says that the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins were expressed.

Wait, but the question says that after transfection into astrocytes, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin. So the construct works in vitro. But in the mouse, the expression isn't happening. So perhaps the construct isn't being properly expressed in the mouse.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the vector is in a position that's not being expressed because of genomic context. But that's more about integration site effects, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles. Based on the stop cassettes, the issue is that the receptor's stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But none of the options directly address this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Because without an enhancer, the promoters might not be active. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. If the enhancer was missing, the CBA might not function, but the question says the Western blot worked, so the construct was expressed.

I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the answer is option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. Because if the ORF is not correctly cloned, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the Western blot would have shown that, unless the eGFP is a separate ORF. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the vector, the eGFP is in frame with the receptor, but in the mouse, due to alternative splicing or some genomic editing, it's not. But I think that's unlikely.

I think the most plausible answer is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: lox2272 is a different variant, and the Cre used (from SOX10-Cre) only recognizes loxP. So the lox2272 stop isn't removed, preventing expression of the receptor and eGFP.

So the issue is that the Cre can't remove the second stop cassette. But none of the options directly state this. Therefore, the next best option is perhaps option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the construct is under strong promoters, so I don't think this is it.

Option D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. If in the vector, the receptor ORF and eGFP are not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the in vitro Western blot showed expression. This is confusing. So perhaps the in vitro Western blot showed the receptor but not eGFP, but the question says they used antibodies against both, and the signal was present.

Wait, the question says the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. The total proteins give a signal proportional to actin loading. So perhaps the proteins were expressed, but in the mouse, they aren't.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the vector's IRES isn't functional in the mouse. So the receptor isn't expressed. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the eGFP after the receptor, but in the wrong reading frame. So in the mouse, it isn't expressed. But in vitro, it may have been expressed due to transient transfection conditions.

I'm still not entirely sure, but I think the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because in the mouse, the construct is integrated, and perhaps the frame is disrupted, but in the transient transfection, it was expressed. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassettes are causing issues. The ligand's stop is loxP and is removed, so ligand is expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, not removed, so receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't made. So the reason is that the Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop.

But since none of the options state this, perhaps the intended answer is option C: enhancer missing. Or maybe option D.

Wait, another thought: the expression cassettes are in the wrong orientation. For example, the receptor is in the opposite direction. But the question says it's a bicistronic vector, so both ORFs are in the same direction.

I think I've thought this through enough. Based on the stop cassette issue, the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest option is C or D.

Wait, the question states that the vector is bicistronic lox-Cre. The ligand is 5', receptor 3'. The ligand has a loxP stop, receptor has lox2272 stop. Cre can only remove loxP, so the receptor stop remains, no eGFP.

Thus, the reason is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C: enhancer missing.

Wait, perhaps the enhancer is downstream of the construct, and without it, the promoters aren't active. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't functional without the stop being removed. So without the stop, the IRES can't function, but that's not the case.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the most plausible is option C: enhancer missing. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP. Stop cassettesâ€”loxP-stop-loxP for the ligand and lox2272-stop-lox2272 for the receptorâ€”are present. SOX10-Cre mice were used to recombine the loxP sites, but no green fluorescence (eGFP) was observed in the offspring. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, this does not explain why the eGFP (linked to the receptor) is not expressed. The issue lies in expression, not function, so this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor were trafficked to the Golgi but not to the cell surface, eGFP would not fluoresce. However, the problem is more likely related to the expression of the receptor itself, not its trafficking. This option does not address the root cause.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES, which should allow expression. The Western blot confirmed expression in vitro, indicating that the promoters are functional. Therefore, the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to be the issue.

4. **Option D: The receptor and the eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP ORFs are not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed. However, the Western blot confirmed expression in vitro, suggesting that the ORFs were correctly cloned and in frame. This makes this option less likely.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the stop cassette for the receptor (lox2272) is not removed because SOX10-Cre does not recognize lox2272. As a result, the receptor-eGFP construct is not expressed, leading to the absence of green fluorescence. However, none of the options directly address this issue. Among the given options, **Option C** ("the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing") is the closest, even though it is not entirely accurate.

Answer: C
