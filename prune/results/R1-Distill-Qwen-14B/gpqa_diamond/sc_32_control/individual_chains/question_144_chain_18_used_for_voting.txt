Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to break this down.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We're supposed to find the mean decay distance. The given data is the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to how long a particle lives on average before decaying. Since particles moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime. Oh right, time dilation plays a role here.

The formula I think I need is the mean lifetime, which is related to the width of the resonance. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. I recall that τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert units correctly.

Wait, no, let's clarify. The natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle: Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, the units might be tricky here. Because ħ is in units of GeV·seconds or something, I need to make sure the units match.

Wait, let me think. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ = ħ / Γ, which would be in seconds.

But wait, in this problem, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that's the mean lifetime in the rest frame of the meson.

Now, but the meson is moving, right? Because it's produced with some energy. So the lifetime we just calculated is the proper time (τ), and the lab frame time will be longer due to time dilation. So the total lifetime in the lab frame (t) is t = γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, how do I find the velocity or gamma? I need to find the speed of the meson. Since E is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV, I can find the kinetic energy and then the gamma factor.

Wait, energy E is the total energy, right? So E = γ m c². But since m is in GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to think in terms of E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Let's compute the momentum p.

Wait, E is 8 GeV. m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So let's compute E²:

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

But perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1. So in natural units, E² = p² + m².

So p² = E² - m² = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = (64 - 1.44) GeV² = 62.56 GeV².

So p = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So the momentum p is about 7.91 GeV/c. Wait, but since we're in natural units, perhaps I'm mixing units here. Maybe it's better to compute beta gamma (βγ) because that comes into the gamma factor.

The gamma factor γ is E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c², so γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, let me calculate that: 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., so γ = 6.666...

So the total lifetime in the lab frame is t = γ τ ≈ 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.6667 * approx 2.0569e-24. Let me compute 6 * 2.0569e-24 is about 1.234e-23, and 0.6667 * 2.0569e-24 is about 1.371e-24, so adding together gives 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24: 6.6667 is approximately 20/3. So 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 * 1e-24.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375. Divided by 3 is about 13.7125. So 13.7125e-24 seconds, which is 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Now, the mean decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * t.

But v is the velocity. Since gamma is 6.6667, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = v/c.

We can find beta from gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667, so 1/gamma² is (3/20)^2 =9/400=0.0225. So beta²=1-0.0225=0.9775 → beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

So v is approximately 0.9887c. Let me compute that in m/s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v is approximately 0.9887 *3e8 ≈2.966e8 m/s.

Now, L = v * t. So t is 1.37125e-23 s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966 *1.37125) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.966 *1.37125:

Approximately 2.966 *1.37 ≈ 4.065. Let me do precise multiplication:

1.37125 *2.966:

Let me compute 1.37125 *3=4.11375. But it's 2.966, so subtract 0.034 *1.37125.

0.034 *1.37125≈0.0466. So 4.11375 -0.0466 ≈4.06715.

So approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait, the options are in 1e-15 and 1e-16 m.

Looking at the options:

A)5.0223 *1e-16 m

B)4.0655 * 1e-15 m

C)5.0223 *1e-15 m

D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, I just calculated about 4.067e-15 m. So option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, let me recheck the calculation of p.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E² =64 GeV², m²=1.44 GeV². So p²=64 -1.44=62.56 GeV². So p= sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV. That's correct.

Gamma is E/(m c²) → but in natural units, E/(m) →8/1.2=6.666..., correct.

Then, proper lifetime τ=ħ/Γ. Wait, ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is given as 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.

So τ=6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

Then, lab frame time is gamma multiplied by τ: 6.6667 *2.056875e-24=1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait: gamma is 6.6667, yes. So t=gamma * tau =6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈1.371e-23 s.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) → sqrt(1 - (9/400))=sqrt(391/400) ≈sqrt(0.9775)= ≈0.9887. So v ≈0.9887c.

v=0.9887c → ~2.966e8 m/s.

So L= v * t =2.966e8 m/s *1.371e-23 s = (2.966 *1.371) *1e-15 m.

Let me compute 2.966 *1.371.

2.966 *1.371:

=2.966*(1 +0.3 +0.07 +0.001)

=2.966*1 =2.966

+2.966*0.3=0.8898

+2.966*0.07=0.20762

+2.966*0.001=0.002966

Adding these together:

2.966 +0.8898 =3.8558

3.8558 +0.20762=4.06342

4.06342 +0.002966≈4.066386.

So about 4.0664e-15 meters. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close, so likely the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again about the calculation of beta. Alternatively, since gamma is E/(m c^2) =8/(1.2)=6.666..., and beta is v/c.

Another way to compute beta is beta = p c / E.

Because p = gamma m v → p c = gamma m v c → v c = (p c)/(gamma m).

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta via v = (p c^2)/(E). Wait, no, perhaps better to use beta = (pc²)/E.

Wait, E²= (pc)^2 c² + (m c²)^2 → E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

But in terms of beta, beta = (pc)/(E) → because from E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2, divide both sides by (mc²)^2:

(E/(m c²))² = (p c/(m c²))² +1 → (gamma)^2 = (p/(m c))² +1.

So (p/(m c)) = sqrt(gamma² -1) → p = m c sqrt(gamma² -1).

Alternatively, beta = (p c)/E → because from E=gamma m c² and p=gamma m v → (p c)=gamma m v c → (p c)=gamma m (v c).

But v c = beta c²? No, v is in terms of c, so v=beta c. So p c = gamma m (beta c) c = gamma m beta c² → p c = gamma m beta c².

But E=gamma m c². So beta = (p c)/E.

So yes, beta = (p c)/E.

Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so beta = p/E.

In our case, p=7.91 GeV/c, E=8 GeV.

So beta = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / (8 GeV) → (7.91 GeV) /8 GeV = 0.98875. So 0.98875c. Same as before.

So v = 0.98875c → about 2.966e8 m/s, correct.

So the decay length is 4.066e-15 meters, which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

I think that's correct. So the answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay length \( L \) is related to the particle's lifetime \( \tau \) and velocity \( v \) by \( L = v \cdot t \), where \( t \) is the total lifetime in the lab frame.

### Step 1: Proper Lifetime (\( \tau \))
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m},
\]
where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Lab Frame Lifetime (\( t \))
The total lifetime in the lab frame is:
\[
t = \gamma \tau.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \) and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):
\[
t = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Velocity (\( v \))
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:
\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]
Thus:
\[
v \approx 0.9887c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Decay Length (\( L \))
The decay length is:
\[
L = v \cdot t.
\]
Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( t \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

**Answer: B**
