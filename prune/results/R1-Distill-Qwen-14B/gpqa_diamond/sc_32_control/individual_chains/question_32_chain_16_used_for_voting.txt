Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons.

So the problem is about calculating the relativistic energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that relativistic energy depends on the gamma factor. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

Let me jot that down: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, v² is (0.96)^2 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Subtracting from 1 gives 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the mass of the nucleus comes into play. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li is approximately 6.941 atomic mass units (u), but wait, wait. Wait, no, Li-6's actual mass is a bit different. Wait, maybe I should get the exact mass.

Wait, the mass number A is 6 for Li-6. The molar mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, so the mass of one Li-6 atom is approximately 6.941 / 6.022e23 grams. But perhaps I can just use the atomic mass in kilograms.

Wait, actually, I think the standard approach is to use the rest mass energy. But perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as approximately the mass of 6 nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 1.007276 GeV/c² for a proton and 1.008665 GeV/c² for a neutron. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV, and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c², which is about 0.9396 GeV. Hmm, but when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less due to binding energy. But for this calculation, perhaps we're supposed to just use the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Alternatively, maybe they give the mass in the problem.

Wait, the problem doesn't give us the mass of the nucleus. Hmm. That's a problem. Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has Z=3, so number of protons is 3. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass can be approximated by adding the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton has a mass of approximately 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. Wait, but wait, in terms of GeV/c², I need to convert u to GeV/c².

1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², which is 0.9315 GeV/c².

So for each proton: 1.007276 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ 0.9383 GeV/c². And for each neutron: 1.008665 u * 0.9315 ≈ 0.9396 GeV/c².

So for 3 protons: 3 * 0.9383 = 2.8149 GeV/c².

For 3 neutrons: 3 * 0.9396 = 2.8188 GeV/c².

So total mass is 2.8149 + 2.8188 = 5.6337 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. That's the sum of the individual nucleon masses. However, the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less because of the binding energy. But perhaps in this problem, they are expecting us to use the rest mass as the sum of the individual masses of the nucleons. Because the problem doesn't give more precise data.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 amu. Oh wait, atomic mass units. So 6.015122 u. So converting that to GeV/c²:

6.015122 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = let me calculate. 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589, 0.015122 * 0.9315 is approximately 0.01406. So total about 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, but earlier when I summed the protons and neutrons, I got 5.6337 GeV/c². Hmm, so this is a discrepancy. Which approach should I take here? Because the actual mass is less than the sum.

But perhaps the problem expects us to model the nucleus as having a rest mass equal to the sum of the individual nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem just expects you to use the mass of the nucleus as 6 times the mass of a proton. But that's probably not correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 6 grams per mole divided by Avogadro's number. Hmm, but that would be incorrect because mass of nucleus is in atomic mass units, whereas grams per mole is molar mass.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the rest mass is 6.015122 u converted to GeV/c².

So, 6.015122 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = let me compute that.

6.015122 * 0.9315 = Let's compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589, and 0.015122 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01406. So total is 5.589 + 0.01406 = 5.60306 GeV/c².

So the rest mass energy is 5.60306 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714 as before.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.60306 ≈ Let's calculate that.

3 *5.60306 is 16.80918.

0.5714 * 5.60306: Let's compute 0.5 *5.60306=2.80153, 0.0714*5.60306≈0.4034. So total is 2.80153 +0.4034≈3.20493.

So total E ≈16.80918 +3.20493=20.0141 GeV.

Wait, but that's approximately 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but wait, maybe there's a more precise calculation involved. Let me redo the gamma calculation more accurately.

Gamma was 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Calculating 0.96 squared again: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise numbers. Let's see: 0.96^2 = 0.9216; 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

So gamma is 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy: I'll compute the exact value. 6.015122 u * 0.931494 GeV/u.

Wait, 931.5 MeV/u is 0.9315 GeV/u. Let me use 0.931494 GeV/u for more precision.

So 6.015122 * 0.931494.

Calculating that:

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.015122 * 0.931494.

Compute 0.01 * 0.931494 = 0.00931494.

0.005122 * 0.931494 ≈ 0.005122 * 0.931494.

Let me compute 0.005 * 0.931494 = 0.00465747.

0.000122 * 0.931494 = 0.00011375.

So 0.00465747 + 0.00011375 = 0.00477122.

So 0.015122 * 0.931494 ≈ 0.00931494 + 0.00477122 = 0.01408616.

So total is 5.588964 + 0.01408616 = 5.60305 GeV.

So rest energy is 5.60305 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma (3.57142857):

5.60305 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285.

0.60305 * 3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.142857142.

0.00305 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.010892857.

So 2.142857142 + 0.010892857 ≈ 2.15375.

So total E ≈ 17.85714285 + 2.15375 ≈ 20.01089 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.01089 GeV.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Our calculation is about 20.01 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV), but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is being considered as 6 nucleons each with 1 GeV/c². Let me see, 6 * 1 GeV is 6 GeV. Then gamma = 3.57142857, so E = 3.57142857 *6=21.42857 GeV. Hmm, which is close to option D (21.419 GeV). But that's a big difference.

Wait, but earlier I computed the rest mass as about 5.6 GeV, but what if the problem uses the sum of the individual nucleon masses, without considering the binding energy? So 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Each proton is 0.938 GeV/c², each neutron is about 0.9396 GeV/c².

So 3*(0.938 + 0.9396) = 3*(1.8776) =5.6328 GeV/c².

So rest mass energy is 5.6328 GeV.

Multiply by gamma: 5.6328 * 3.57142857 ≈ Let's compute.

5 *3.5714 is 17.857.

0.6328 *3.5714 ≈ 2.262.

Total E≈17.857 +2.262 ≈20.119 GeV.

Which is about 20.119 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close.

So perhaps the assumed approach is to sum the nucleon masses. Hence, the answer is approximately 20.119 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. The options have C as 20.132, which is close.

But wait, maybe the problem uses more precise values. Let me check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything more accurately.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Rest mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u.

Convert that to GeV/c²: 6.015122 u * 0.931494 GeV/u.

Calculating this: 6.015122 *0.931494.

Let me compute it step by step.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.015122 * 0.931494 = ?

0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.005122 *0.931494= Let's compute:

0.005 *0.931494=0.00465747.

0.000122 *0.931494= approx 0.00011375.

So 0.00465747 +0.00011375=0.00477122.

So 0.015122 *0.931494=0.00931494 +0.00477122=0.01408616.

So total rest energy =5.588964 +0.01408616=5.60305 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma: 5.60305 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.60305 *3.57142857.

Let me break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.60305 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.00305 *3.57142857= approx 0.010892857.

So 2.142857142 +0.010892857=2.15375.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.15375=19. (Wait, 17.85714285 +2.15375=20.01089285 GeV.)

So E≈20.01089 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419.

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up the mass of the nucleus. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem treats the Li-6 nucleus as having a mass of 6 times the mass of a proton. So 6 *0.938 GeV/c² =5.628 GeV. Then E=5.628 *3.5714≈20.08 GeV. Closer to option C.

But earlier calculation with the exact rest mass gave 20.01 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) without considering binding energy.

In that case, the rest mass energy would be (3*0.9383) + (3*0.9396) =2.8149+2.8188=5.6337 GeV.

So E=5.6337 *3.5714= Let's compute:

5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.6337 *3.5714.

Compute 0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.0337 *3.5714≈0.1198.

So 2.14284 +0.1198=2.26264.

Total E=17.857 +2.26264=20.1196 GeV.

So 20.1196 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So the answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at 0.96c, we calculate the relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

The rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is calculated using its atomic mass. The exact mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.015122 \, \text{u} \), and converting this to GeV/c² using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV/c}^2 \):

\[
m c^2 = 6.015122 \times 0.931494 \approx 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Substituting into the energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \approx 20.01089 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This value is closest to option C, \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \). While minor discrepancies may arise due to approximations, the calculation aligns most closely with this option.
