Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol, but here we have a specific case with different amounts and concentrations.

First, I need to find out how much H+ and OH- ions are present in each solution because that determines the extent of the neutralization reaction.

Wait, but the acids and the base here are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely, giving one H+ per molecule. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, it’s a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but in dilute solutions, maybe I can assume that both H+ are released. Or wait, when H2SO4 is in water, the first H+ comes off easily, the second maybe not as much. But sometimes in neutralization, we consider only the first H+ because the second might not dissociate completely. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, H2SO4 is considered to provide two H+ ions, so for each mole, two H+ are available.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each molecule dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So the plan is: calculate moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, then moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then find the limiting reactant because the neutralization will depend on which is in lesser quantity.

Wait, but wait. Let me break down each solution step by step.

First, calculate moles of HCl. Molarity is moles per liter. So 500 mL is 0.5 L. Moles HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles. Each HCl gives 1 H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 moles. Now, each H2SO4 can donate 2 H+ (if both dissociate), so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2. 200 mL is 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. Wait, but in neutralization, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So which is the limiting reagent?

H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So neutralization is to form water, and the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ neutralized.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy change would be based on that.

But wait, what's the enthalpy per mole? I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). Because each mole of H+ neutralizes releases about 57 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Let me get that right. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base to produce water. So for a strong acid and strong base, it's approximately -57 kJ/mol. But since here we have more than one H+ source, but the OH- comes from a strong base, so it should be considered.

So the neutralization reaction here is:

H+ (from acids) + OH- (from base) → H2O.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases 57 kJ. So the total enthalpy change is the moles of H+ that reacted multiplied by 57 kJ/mol.

In this case, moles of OH- is 0.2, which is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 moles of H+ react.

So 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but let me check the units. Because the options have some in kcal and some in kJ.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is roughly 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.727 kcal. But wait, the question is about enthalpy of neutralization. But wait, the options include a -11.42 kJ option (option D) and a -2.72 kcal option (A).

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because the actual neutralization reaction per mole is -57 kJ/mol H+ neutralized, but let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-, but perhaps it's better to think about the acid and base in terms of equivalents.

Wait, another approach: calculate equivalents of acid and base.

Equivalents for acid: HCl has 1 H+ per mole, so 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 eq. H2SO4, assuming both H+ dissociate, so 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 eq. So total acid equivalents = 0.28 eq.

Equivalents for base: Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole, so 0.1 mol * 2 = 0.2 eq. So the base has 0.2 eq.

In neutralization, the acid and base will neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.2 eq of base will neutralize 0.2 eq of acid, leaving 0.08 eq of acid unreacted.

So the amount of H+ that actually reacts is 0.2 eq, each equivalent contributing -57 kJ.

So total enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as -11.4 kJ, but in kcal. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ). So 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but I'm getting a little confused. Let me double-check.

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of neutralization. So each mole of H+ (or OH-) that reacts contributes -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles reacting gives 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than this. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 * 1 kcal ≈ 11.4 kJ, but that's not matching because 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Let me do that math: 11.4 kJ divided by 4.184 ≈ 2.727 kcal. So that would be about -2.73 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal).

Wait, but wait. That's conflicting. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express.

Wait, the enthalpy change is -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 moles would give -57 * 0.2 = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute 11.4 kJ in kcal.

11.4 kJ / 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 2.728 kcal.

So the total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or -2.728 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which aligns with this. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much larger than the calculated value.

Wait, so why is there a discrepancy between kJ and kcal options? Let me check the problem statement again. It says 'enthalpy of neutralization' which is usually expressed in kJ/mol in textbooks, but sometimes in kcal too. But the options have both, so perhaps I need to choose between them.

Wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy when these solutions are mixed. So the total heat released would be 0.2 moles * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have -11.42 kcal, which is roughly 47.8 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184 ≈47.8). That's way higher than 11.4 kJ. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the equivalents. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should account for the fact that H2SO4 is diprotic, but maybe only the first H+ is considered in neutralization. Because the second H+ may not dissociate fully, especially in a solution with excess H+.

Wait, but in the problem, we're mixing HCl and H2SO4 with a base. So the H+ from both acids would be available. So the total H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles, and from H2SO4, assuming both H+ are available (since it's a strong acid), 0.09 * 2 =0.18. So total H+ is 0.28.

But the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles. So 0.2 moles H+ reacts, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the neutralization per mole of each acid and base. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat for each acid-base reaction separately.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each reaction separately and sum them.

For example: HCl (strong acid) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (strong base). The reaction would be HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O. The stoichiometry would be moles of HCl to moles of Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of HCl gives 1 H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-. So the reaction would require 2 moles of HCl for each mole of Ba(OH)2. Alternatively, if HCl is in excess, but let me see.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to calculate the neutralization of each acid with the base.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach I took earlier is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, another approach: calculate each acid's contribution.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole of HCl gives 1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+ (assuming both dissociate). So 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

So the neutralization will involve 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-, producing 0.2 moles H2O.

The enthalpy change is for 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, which is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, which is option D (-16.0 kJ is not close), but wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed. Or perhaps the problem is that the Ba(OH)2 is dihydroxide, so each mole gives two OH-.

Wait, I think my approach is correct. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem mixes all the solutions and then the neutralization occurs. So maybe I have to compute the neutralization considering all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, but I think I did that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the heat capacity of the solution to calculate the temperature change, but that's more complicated and I don't think the question provides enough data for that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.2 M, 500 mL → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M, 200 mL → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol.

So H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts, leaving 0.08 H+.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → approx -11.4 kJ (since 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ → 2.72 kcal ≈ 11.4 kJ). So 2.72 kcal is approximately 11.4 kJ.

Wait, no, 2.72 kcal * 4.184 ≈ 11.4 kJ. So 2.72 kcal is about 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the calculation was -11.4 kJ, so that's -2.72 kcal.

So looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much larger.

So why is option D present? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to consider the total moles of H+ and OH- in a more precise way.

Wait, the problem might be in how I'm counting the H+ from H2SO4. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in some cases, the second dissociation may not be complete. For example, the first H+ is fully ionized, but the second may not be. So if we only consider the first H+, then H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 moles of H+.

Let me try that.

So, HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 → 0.09 moles H+ (only first H+).

Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So H+ is the limiting reagent because 0.19 < 0.2. So all 0.19 moles of H+ react, producing 0.19 moles H2O.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 * (-57) = -10.83 kJ.

Hmm, that's about -2.59 kcal. But that's not one of the options. The closest is option A, -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the second H+ as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

If I proceed with the initial approach, where both H+ from H2SO4 are considered, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2. So 0.2 moles H+ neutralized, -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal. So option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact moles and then see.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the way the question is phrased, the enthalpy is per mole of each acid and base, but I'm not considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should write the neutralization reactions.

HCl (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l)

But the stoichiometry here would be 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of HCl are needed.

Similarly, H2SO4 can react with Ba(OH)2. The reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, one mole of Ba(OH)2 is needed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to treat the reactions separately.

So first, let's calculate how much HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

Moles of HCl: 0.1.

The reaction requires 2 HCl per Ba(OH)2. So to completely neutralize 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, we'd need 0.2 moles HCl. But we only have 0.1 moles HCl available. So HCl is the limiting reagent.

So all 0.1 moles HCl will react, requiring 0.05 moles Ba(OH)2.

After this reaction:

HCl used: 0.1 mol → H+ contributed: 0.1 mol.

Ba(OH)2 used: 0.05 mol → OH- contributed: 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol.

So remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol → OH- remaining: 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol, which can contribute 2 H+ each if fully dissociated. So 0.18 H+.

Now, the remaining OH- is 0.1 mol, and the available H+ is 0.18 + any from HCl? No, HCl is all used up.

Wait, no; after HCl is used up, the H+ comes only from H2SO4. So from H2SO4, 0.18 H+ are available.

So now, the neutralization between H2SO4 (H+) and Ba(OH)2 (OH-).

We have 0.18 H+ and 0.1 OH-.

They will react in a 1:1 ratio, so all 0.1 OH- will react with 0.1 H+ from H2SO4.

So total H+ neutralized: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is the same as before. So the answer is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches this value. So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a strong acid and dissociates completely. Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Limiting Reagent**:  
   The neutralization reaction occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio of H⁺ to OH⁻.  
   Since \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺} > 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \), OH⁻ is the limiting reagent.  
   Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \) will react with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺} \).

5. **Enthalpy Change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

6. **Conversion to kcal**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \),  
   \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

7. **Matching the Options**:  
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) and Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) do not match.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
