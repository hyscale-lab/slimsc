Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies some calculations.

The host stars are different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same size. Interesting.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So the question is about figuring out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet's orbit and the star. The formula I think is: P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e^2))), but since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero. So the probability simplifies to P = R_star/(a_planet * sqrt(2)), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think more accurately.

Hmm, the transit probability P is given by the formula: P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a_planet) * (sqrt( (1 + (R_star / a_planet)^2 ) / (1 + (R_star / (a_planet * sqrt(1-e^2)))^2 ) )) ), but since e is zero, that part simplifies.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to remember the approximate formula for transit probability. I think it's P = (R_star / a_planet) * (sqrt(1 + (M_star / M_planet)))), but no, that doesn't seem right. Wait no, that's probably not it.

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately P = (R_star / a_planet) * [ (something involving the inclination, but I think the main factor is R_star/a_planet) ]. Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit.

Wait, another way to think about it: the probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (something involving the star's radius and the planet's orbital size)). Or perhaps the formula is P ≈ (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (something else)).

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't do that right now. Let me think. I remember that the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but if the planet is Earth-like and the star is much larger, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So P ≈ (R_star / a_planet) * (something else). Or maybe it's (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is small, we can approximate it as R_star / a_planet.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit.

The exact formula for the probability is P = (R_star / a) * ( (sqrt(1 + (R_star/a)^2 )) )^{-1} ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read somewhere that the probability is approximately (R_star)/(a), but scaled by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_star)/(a * sqrt(2)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a) multiplied by the impact parameter. Wait, no, the impact parameter is related to where the planet transits relative to the star's center, but for the probability, that's more about whether it actually transits, not the depth.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (R_star/a))) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / sqrt(2)) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the area. The planet will transit if the line of sight is within a certain cone. The solid angle of the star as seen from Earth is π R_star² / (4 d²), where d is the distance. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But if R_planet is much less than R_star, it's approximately R_star/a_planet.

Wait, another angle: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), assuming the orbit is edge-on. But the actual probability also depends on the relative orientation. The exact probability is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) ) divided by (something). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, I think the key factor here is that the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's semi-major axis (a). So a smaller a (closer planet) would have a higher probability because R_star is fixed. But wait, in this question, the star's radius might vary. Wait, in the problem, both host stars have the same radius. Oh, the problem says, "both have the same radii." So R1 = R2.

So for a planet, the transit probability is higher when the semi-major axis a is smaller. Because P is proportional to (R_star / a). So if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

So let's find a for each planet.

We can use Kepler's third law to find a. The version for a planet around a star is:

a^3 = (G (M_star) P^2 ) / (4 π² )

But since we're comparing two planets, perhaps we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

P1 = (P2) / 3.

Because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

M1 = 2 M2. Because the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

So, let's write the formula for a^3 for each.

a1^3 = ( G * M1 * P1^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = ( G * M2 * P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

Take the ratio of a1^3 to a2^3:

(a1^3)/(a2^3) = (M1/M2) * (P1^2)/(P2^2 )

Substituting M1=2 M2 and P1 = P2/3:

= (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2 )

= 2 * ( (P2^2) / 9 ) / P2^2 )

= 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

Taking cube roots: a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 ≈ a2 * 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

So a_planet1 is smaller than a_planet2.

Since the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), and both have the same R_star, P1 is (R / a1), and P2 is (R / a2).

So the ratio P1 / P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found that a1 = 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, no. Because P1 is (R/a1), and P2 is (R/a2). So P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 is smaller than a2, a2/a1 is greater than 1. So P1 is higher.

So which planet has a higher probability? Planet_1, because it's closer in (smaller a), so higher transit probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Option D says 2.7 times. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

We have a1^3 = (M1 * P1^2) / (M2 * P2^2) ) * a2^3.

Wait, a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2).

M1 is 2 M2, so M1/M2 = 2.

P1 is (1/3) P2, so P1^2 / P2^2 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So a1^3/a2^3 = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate 2/9: approx 0.222.

The cube root of 0.222: Let me compute. 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is 0.006 less than 0.222. So the cube root is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

Therefore, the ratio a2/a1 is 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

Thus, P1 = (R/a1) = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) = 1.65 * (R/a2).

But P2 is (R/a2). So P1 is 1.65 times P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, hence the correct option is C.

Looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which depends on the star's radius \( R_{\text{star}} \) and the planet's orbital semi-major axis \( a_{\text{planet}} \). The transit probability is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the key factor is the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \) by:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_{\text{star}} P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2, we know:
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's),
- \( M_1 = 2 M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star).

Taking the ratio of \( a_1^3 \) to \( a_2^3 \):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2/3}{P_2}\right)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

Since the transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), and both stars have the same radius, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
