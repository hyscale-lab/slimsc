Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right, red phosphorus and HI is likely a reaction to form an acid from an ester or something similar.

First, I need to figure out what the original compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data given.

The IR data has peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests O-H stretching, maybe in an acid or an ester. But wait, the strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is a key. That's a carbonyl group. 1720 is usually indicative of an ester (since carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers around 1700, but sometimes higher if deprotonated, but maybe not in this case). Wait, but there's also a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those could be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe compound X is an aromatic ester, like a phenyl ester or something similar.

Looking at the NMR data now. So the 1H NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet, probably an O-H proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but earlier I thought it was an ester. Hmm, conflicting ideas. Alternatively, if it's an ester, maybe that's an acidic proton from a carbonyl oxygen, but that's usually not that downfield. Alternatively, the 10.5 could be an aldehyde proton, but that's unlikely in this context. Wait, wait, another possibility: maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. Let me think.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. So perhaps a nitro group? No, wait, but another option is a carbonyl group like a ketone or ester. Wait, but if the ring has an ester group, maybe a benzene ring with a carbonyl substituent.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm could be a carboxylic acid proton. So if the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl, but if it's a carboxylic acid, why isn't the O-H peak at around 2500-3000? Oh wait, the IR has a broad peak from 3400–2500, which would cover the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid (which is usually broad and around 2500-3300). So maybe the IR suggests a carboxylic acid. So the 1720 cm-1 would fit a carboxylic acid's carbonyl (maybe). Wait, but I thought carboxylic acids are around 1700 cm-1, perhaps lower. Esters are higher, around 1740 maybe. Hmm, but this is 1720, so maybe it's a conjugated ester or an acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? But then why the O-H in NMR?

Wait, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Let's think about the NMR.

In the NMR, the 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H) are probably two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's say the substituent is at the para position. So if the substituent is a group that causes the ring protons to split into two doublets, like a substituent with an electron-withdrawing effect.

So the substituent could be a carbonyl group, like a -COOR ester or a -COOH group. So if it's a carboxylic acid, then the 10.5 ppm peak would be the -COOH proton.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). So that's a chain of some sort. The 0.9 triplet suggests a terminal methyl group, perhaps attached to a CH2. The 1.4 doublet (3H) could be a methyl adjacent to another CH, maybe a CH(CH3) group. Wait, but let's think about how these signals could correlate.

The 2.9 (m,1H) is a multiplet, maybe a CH group next to another CH. The 1.7 (m,2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups or a CH2 next to another CH. Let me try to piece this together. 

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) attached to a longer chain. Let me imagine the substituent is a -COOH group connected via a chain.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which would be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe this is an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone, but that's less likely with the O-H.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group attached to the benzene, with a carbonyl somewhere.

Wait, the NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which would be a CH2CH2CH3 group, perhaps. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, which would make it an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, let's try to model this. Maybe the substituent is a -CO-O-R group, but that would mean an ester, but then the 10.5 ppm wouldn't be a proton from the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group. So the benzene ring has a -COOH group. Then, the -COOH would give the IR peak at 1720, but wait, I thought carboxylic acids are around 1700. Maybe it's a conjugated acid, so higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone, but then the O-H wouldn't be present.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, like a benzyl ester but attached with a chain.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is probably a -COOH proton. So the IR's 1720 would be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group and some substituents.

Then, looking at the rest of the NMR. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are the aromatic protons. Let's say the benzene is para-substituted with a group that has an electron-withdrawing effect, which would cause the adjacent protons to be downfield. So the substituent is in the para position, and the two protons adjacent are each as a doublet.

Now, the other signals: 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. Let's think about a chain attached to the ring. Maybe something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH2COOH group? Or maybe a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH group? Let me sketch that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring, but how? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows 10.5 ppm (1H, broad, probably -COOH), and the aromatic protons. The other signals are for a chain. Let's imagine the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH.

Wait, but let's think about the integration. The 2.9 (m,1H) could be a CH group next to another CH2. The 1.7 (m,2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups. Hmm, but how.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. But the 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group, so the end of a chain. The 1.4 doublet (3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. So the ring has a -COOH group connected to a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but that would make the structure something like benzene-(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which would give the following NMR signals: the CH2 would be around 2.9 ppm, perhaps as a multiplet, and the CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl at 1.4 ppm as a doublet. Wait, but the CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COO-R group, but then the 10.5 would be the R-O-H, but that doesn't fit the ester scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary alcohol, but the IR has the 3400-2500, which could be O-H stretching.

Wait, let me recap. The IR suggests a carbonyl (1720) and O-H (3400–2500). The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is likely a carboxylic acid proton. So the substituent is a -COOH group. So the benzene ring has a -COOH group in the para position, and possibly some other substituents.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene is -COOH, and then another substituent, perhaps on the benzene, making it a di-substituted ring. Or maybe the -COOH is attached to a chain that's attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene-(CH2)n-COOH. Let's see what n would be. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is typical for a terminal CH2CH2CH3 (like in ethyl groups). The 1.4 doublet suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the chain is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Not exactly, but the signals may correspond to a CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group? So the benzene ring is attached to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH2CH3), which is connected to a COOH.

So the NMR would show the COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H), which fits a para-substituted ring. So the substituent is at the para position.

Now, the chain: the CH2 next to the ring would be at around 3.0 ppm? Or maybe 2.9 is that CH2.

Then, the CH(CH2CH3) group would have a CH at 2.9, and the adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7. Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH?

Wait, but then the chain would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. So the NMR would have:

- The CH2 next to the ring (CH2-) would be a triplet if it's adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but in this case, CH2 is connected to CH(CH2CH3). So the CH2 would be split into a quartet perhaps, but in the data it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the chain is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, where the CH is at 2.9, the adjacent CH2 is at 1.7, and the terminal CH3 is at 0.9. The 1.4 doublet (3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps the group is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2COOH? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think about the substituent on the benzene as a -COOH group attached to a sec-butyl chain. So the structure would be benzene-(COOH) attached to a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to something. Hmm, but the NMR shows a 1.4 d (3H), which would be a methyl attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is:

Ph-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, but that would give the CH2 groups as 1.7 ppm (the middle CH2), and the CH(CH3) would have a methyl at 1.4 as a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, let me think about the chain. The 0.9 ppm triplet indicates a CH2CH2CH3 group, so perhaps a propyl group. The 1.4 d (3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, so a CH(CH3) group. Then, the 2.9 (m,1H) is the CH group adjacent to the methyl. The 1.7 (m,2H) would be the CH2 next to that CH.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the COOH. But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-COOH. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the COOH. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options given. The options are A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, so option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. Let's see if that fits the data.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position, then the structure would be:

Ph-(sec-butyl)COOH, but wait, benzoic acid is Ph-COOH. So attaching a sec-butyl group at the para position would make the structure 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the benzene ring would have a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

Now, let's think about the NMR for that structure.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the given data (8.0 d, 2H and 7.2 d, 2H). So that fits.

The COOH proton is at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which also fits.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-. So the structure would be Ph-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no. Wait, the benzoic acid is Ph-COOH, and the substituent on the benzene is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)- group. Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is actually -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, no. Wait, butyl is four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, no, wait, that's not right. Let me think.

The structure of a butyl group: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached via the first carbon. iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, no. Wait, butyl groups can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2- (branch at the second carbon)
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- ? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify:

Butyl groups:

1. n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3- (straight chain)
2. iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2- (branch at second carbon)
3. sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but wait, that's four carbons? No, because the second carbon would be CH, attaching to another CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but that's more than four carbons. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would make five carbons, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The correct structure for sec-butyl is actually -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be five carbons in total. No, that can't be. Wait, butyl is four carbons, so the correct structure for sec-butyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)- but that's four carbons in total.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, that's more like iso-butyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look it up mentally.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Wait, no. Wait, butyl groups are four carbons. The sec-butyl group is:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be four carbons in the substituent.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. No, that's three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group? No, options suggest it's a butyl.

Wait, maybe it's better to focus on the NMR of the substituent.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, what would the NMR look like?

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. So the structure would be benzene attached to a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, so the substituent would be -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-. So the CH(CH3) is the third carbon, attached to the second CH2.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain: benzene-(CH2)2-CH(CH3). So the NMR signals would be:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2-) would be around 1.7 ppm (as a quartet or triplet?), but in the data, it's at 1.7 (m, 2H). Hmm, that makes sense for two adjacent CH2 groups.

- The CH(CH3) would have a methyl at 1.4 ppm as a doublet because it's attached to a CH.

- The next CH2 group (the one attached to the benzene) would be around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (maybe a triplet), but in the data, it's a multiplet at 2.9 (1H). Wait, that doesn't fit because that would be a CH2, but the data shows 1H as a multiplet. Hmm, maybe I'm off.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene, then the CH2 would be at 1.7 (m, 2H), the CH(CH3) would have a methyl at 1.4 (d, 3H), and the CH2 next to the ring would be at 2.9 (m,1H). Wait, but that would be a CH2 group, so 2H. But in the data, it's 1H. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Then, the CH would be at 2.9 (m,1H), the adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 (m,2H), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 (t,3H).

Wait, that fits some of the data. So the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that would only be three carbons, not four. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to model the substituent as a propyl group with a branch. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. But that's four carbons, which would make it a butyl group. Wait, no, that's a pentyl. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Then, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Let's see:

The benzene would have a COOH group and the substituent in the para position. The substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene: perhaps around 2.9 ppm as a triplet (if next to another CH2).

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have protons at 1.7 ppm (as a multiplet for the adjacent CH2?), but that doesn't fit exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) with a sec-butyl group at the para position. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the COOH is in the para position relative to it.

The structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) in position 4 and a sec-butyl in position 1. So the benzene has substituents at positions 1 and 4: a sec-butyl and a COOH group.

Now, the NMR of the substituent:

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, no, the correct structure is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that's five carbons. Wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-, which is a four-carbon chain. So the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no, that would place the COOH on the substituent chain, but benzoic acid has the COOH attached directly to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that's iso-butyl.

I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Maybe I should focus on the reaction part.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if the compound is an acyl chloride, but I don't think so. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the hydrolysis of an acyl bromide or chloride to an acid, but in this case, perhaps the compound is an ester.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. So if X is a benzene ring with a COOH group and some substituent, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might not change it. Unless X is an ester, which would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

So let's imagine that compound X is an ester, like a phenyl ester. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

So, for example, if X is methyl benzoate, the reaction would give benzoic acid. But in our case, the ester would have a substituent on the benzene ring and a longer chain.

Wait, let me think: if X is an ester with the structure benzene-(R)COOR', then after hydrolysis, it would become benzene-(R)COOH.

So looking back at the NMR data of X, which has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if X is an ester, the O-H would not be present. So that would contradict the NMR data, because esters don't have O-H protons.

Hmm, this is confusing. So if the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which suggests an O-H, then X must be a carboxylic acid, not an ester. So then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't change it, because it's already a carboxylic acid. But that doesn't make sense because the question says X reacts to form another product. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak isn't an O-H. Could it be an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but it's a singlet. However, the IR doesn't show a peak around 2700-2800 cm-1 which is typical for aldehydes. So probably not.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is an acidic proton from a phenol group. But phenol O-H is usually broader and around 5 ppm, but sometimes upfield. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol proton, but alcohols are usually around 1-5 ppm, but again, maybe in some cases broader.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde. But earlier I thought that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 is a ketone? No, that can't be, since ketones don't have protons.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me try to reevaluate.

If the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, and a broad peak in the 3400-2500 region, which suggests O-H, then the compound is likely a carboxylic acid, which has both features. So the initial compound X is a substituted benzoic acid.

Then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Well, I'm trying to remember. Red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of esters, but if X is a carboxylic acid, there's nothing to hydrolyze. So that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe X is an acyl chloride, but then the IR would show a peak around 1800 cm-1, not 1720. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid anhydride, but that's less likely given the NMR.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, but the O-H peak is from another source. Wait, but esters don't have O-H protons. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, if X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, but if X is a carboxylic acid, what would happen when treated with HI and red phosphorus? I'm not sure that reaction would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in that case, the initial compound X would be an ester, and the product would be the carboxylic acid. So looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid, so that would be the product, and X would be the ester.

So, perhaps X is the ester, and the reaction produces the acid.

But then, the NMR data of X (the ester) would not show the broad O-H peak at 10.5 ppm. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let's imagine that X is an ester with the structure RCOOR', and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes RCOOH.

So, the question is to find the structure of X, which is an ester, and upon hydrolysis, gives the product in the options.

Wait, but the NMR data of X has a broad O-H peak, which can't be from an ester. So perhaps X is not an ester, but something else.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI is typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. The reaction is: RCOOR' + HI → RCOOH + R'OH.

So, if X is an ester, the product would be the corresponding acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. So if X is an ester, the product would be one of these.

But the NMR data of X includes a broad O-H peak, which doesn't fit an ester. So perhaps X is a methyl ester, but that would have a methylene group.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzyl ester.

Wait, maybe X is benzyl propanoate. But that may not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester with a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try to reconstruct the structure of X based on the NMR.

The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituents are likely a carbonyl group (either COOH or COOR) and another group.

The other NMR signals (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9) suggest a chain of some sort. Let's think of this as a propyl group attached to a CH(CH3).

So, putting it all together, perhaps X is an ester where the ester group is attached to a benzene ring, with a substituent that's a propyl chain ending with a methyl group. Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-O-CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, that would be a pentyl chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is Ph-CO-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's four carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CO-O-CH(CH2CH2CH3), but that's a longer chain.

Wait, the 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group, the 1.4 doublet suggests a CH(CH3), the 2.9 is a CH, and the 1.7 is a CH2. So the chain could be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that would be a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ester oxygen.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should try to match the options.

If X is an ester, and the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then X would be the ester form, like methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

But then the NMR of X (the ester) would have a triplet for the ethyl group in the ester (like OCH2CH3), but the given NMR doesn't show such peaks. Instead, it shows 0.9 (t,3H), which would be the end of a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps the ester group is not a simple methyl ester but a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, the NMR data might not show the ester oxygen's CH2 groups if they are part of a longer chain. For example, if the ester is part of a butyl group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the reaction again.

If X is an ester, and after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes a carboxylic acid, then the product would have the same aromatic substituents but the ester group replaced by a carboxylic acid.

So looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would be the product if X was the corresponding ester.

So the structure of X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, like methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

But wait, the NMR data for X would then have a triplet for the methyl group of the ester (OCH3), but in the given data, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm, which would correspond to a CH2CH2CH3 group, not a methyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should focus on the substituent chain.

The substituent chain in X has the following NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

This suggests a four-carbon chain with a branch. The 0.9 triplet indicates a -CH2CH2CH3 group, which is the end of a propyl chain. The 1.4 doublet suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2.

So the chain could be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons, which might not fit. Alternatively, it's a four-carbon chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would give a triplet at 0.9 for the terminal CH3, a doublet at 1.4 for the CH(CH3), and the CH2 groups at 1.7 and 2.9.

Wait, perhaps the chain is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. No, that's five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a three-carbon chain with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is attached to the ring via a two-carbon chain, and then a CH(CH3).

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m,1H)
- The adjacent CH2 groups at 1.7 ppm (m,2H)
- The CH3 on the CH(CH3) at 1.4 ppm (d,3H)
- And the terminal CH2CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Wait, but that would require a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, something like -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that would give a four-carbon substituent. So the substituent would be -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)- attached to the ring.

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) as a quartet around 2.9 ppm (since it's adjacent to a CH2)
- The CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (as a triplet for each)
- The methyl group at 1.4 ppm (doublet)
- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (triplet)

Wait, that might fit the given data.

So if the substituent is a -(CH2)2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring, and the ring has a carbonyl group (as a COOH or COOR), then the structure would be either a benzoic acid or an ester.

But given the O-H peak, it's more likely a carboxylic acid. So X would be 4-(propyl group)benzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's see if that fits.

The structure of sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. But that would be four carbons in total.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring would be at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H)
- The CH3 on the CH(CH3) would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H)
- The terminal CH2 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H)

Wait, but that would require the CH(CH3) to be adjacent to the ring, which would make the substituent a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about this. However, given the options, option C seems to fit the description of a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't change it because it's already a carboxylic acid. But the question states that X reacts to form another product. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe X is an ester, and the product is the acid. So, if X is the ester, and it's converted to the acid, then the product would be the acid form. Looking at the options, option C is the acid, so X would be the ester.

But then, the NMR of X (the ester) wouldn't have the broad O-H peak. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the 10.5 ppm peak isn't an O-H. Let me try to think differently.

Another possibility for the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes have a characteristic peak around 9-10 ppm. But then, the IR would show a peak around 2700-2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. The given IR doesn't mention that, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound X is a phenyl ester with a side chain that includes an alcohol group. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 10.5 ppm is from an acidic alkyne proton, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is something else, like decarboxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known to convert alcohols to iodides, but more commonly, it's used for the hydrolysis of esters. Wait, but red phosphorus is used with HI for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, especially in the presence of water.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then the product would be the corresponding acid. So which option is the acid?

Options A and C are acids. So if X is an ester, the product would be either option A or C.

Looking at the NMR of X, which has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is typically for a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the ester's R' group would be a propyl chain.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester like ethyl phenylpropanoate or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester with a longer chain, like iso-butyl phenyl ester.

But I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and that the reaction doesn't change it because it's already the acid form. But that doesn't make sense because the question says X reacts to form a product.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and X is an ester, and the product is the acid, which is option C.

So, in summary, the initial compound X is an ester, which upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, forms the carboxylic acid. The correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectral data provided for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group.
- The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or an ester.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from two adjacent CH₂ groups.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₃ group in a propyl chain.

### Structural Interpretation:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chain substituent. The chain substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the signals:
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group attached to a CH.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** corresponds to the CH group in the sec-butyl group.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** corresponds to the CH₂ groups in the sec-butyl chain.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal CH₃ group in the chain.

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically hydrolyzes esters to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not alter its structure. Therefore, the final product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Option Analysis:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the substituents and chain structure do not match the spectral data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the spectral data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the spectral data and remains unchanged after the reaction.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as it is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the spectral data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
