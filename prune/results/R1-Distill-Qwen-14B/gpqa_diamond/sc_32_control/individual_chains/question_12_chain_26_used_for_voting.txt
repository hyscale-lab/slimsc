Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV, and I guess the neutrino is considered massless because I don't remember neutrinos having significant mass in these kinds of problems. Or wait, do I? I think sometimes they are taken as massless for simplicity in these calculations, especially in basic problems.

So, when a particle is at rest and decays, the total energy and momentum before decay must equal the total after. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the decay products must cancel each other out. That means the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me jot down the knowns:

- Mass of Pi(+) (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²
- Mass of mu(+) (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²
- Mass of neutrino (m_nu) ≈ 0 MeV/c² (assuming it's negligible)
- Energy and momentum conservation applies.

The decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu.

Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy, E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. Each particle's energy is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is just its kinetic energy. Wait, no, the neutrino's total energy is kinetic because its rest energy is zero, so E_nu = K_nu. Similarly, the muon's total energy is E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (K_nu).

But since energy is conserved, this must equal E_pi. So:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu

Which simplifies to:

139.6 MeV = 105.7 MeV + K_mu + K_nu

So, K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, momentum. The pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. The muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|, but in opposite directions. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, which equals the neutrino's.

The muon's total energy is given by E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. Therefore, p = sqrt( (E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 c^4) ) / c. But since E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu, we can write:

p = sqrt( ( (m_mu c² + K_mu)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2 ) ) / c^2 ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of p.

Let me denote:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

E_nu = p c (since for a massless particle, E=pc)

But wait, no. Wait, for the neutrino, since its mass is zero, E_nu = p_nu c. But p_mu = p_nu because their directions are opposite and magnitudes are equal. So, E_nu = p c.

So, the total energy equation becomes:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2

Which is:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c²

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by c², and let's work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So, let me make that substitution.

So the equation becomes:

sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_pi

Substituting the masses:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV

So,

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me denote x = p.

So,

sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) + x = 139.6

Hmm, this looks like an equation we can solve for x. Let's subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right-hand side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2

So,

x^2 + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x^2

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute the squares:

105.7^2 = approx (105.7 * 105.7) → Let's calculate:

105 *105 = 11,025. 0.7^2=0.49. The cross terms are 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

Wait, actually, wait another method: 105.7 * 105.7.

Wait, 105 = 100 +5. 0.7 is added.

Let me compute it as (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2.

105^2 is 11025.

2*105 *0.7 = 210 *0.7 = 147.

0.7^2=0.49.

So total is 11025 +147=11172, plus 0.49 → 11172.49. So, 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let's calculate.

139^2 = (140 -1)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*1 +1 =19600 -280 +1=19321.

0.6^2=0.36.

Then, the cross term between 139 and 0.6 is 2*139*0.6= 2*83.4= 166.8.

So, 139.6^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6^2 → 19321 + 166.8 +0.36 = 19321 + 167.16= 19488.16. So approximately 19488.16 MeV².

So back to the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Wait, because 2*139.6 is 279.2. So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Now, let's rearrange:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 minus 11000 is 8488.16; minus 172.49 is 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67

So,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 30 would give 8376, which is 60 higher. So 29.8 perhaps.

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = ?

279.2 *30=8376.

Minus 279.2 → 8376 -279.2=8096.8.

So 29 times is 8096.8, which is lower than 8315.67.

Difference is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

How much more than 29 is needed?

Each 0.1 more (29.1) adds 279.2 *0.1=27.92.

So 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So x≈ 29.782.

Wait, so 29.78.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate this more accurately.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.78 = ?

Wait, 29.78 * 279.2.

Let me compute 29 * 279.2 = 8096.8.

0.78 * 279.2 → 0.7*279.2=195.44, 0.08*279.2=22.336 → total 217.776.

So 8096.8 +217.776=8314.576, which is very close to 8315.67. So the value is approximately 29.78.

So x≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think. The variable x is p, so p≈29.78 MeV/c.

So, now, the momentum of the muon is about 29.78 MeV/c.

Then, the energy of the muon E_mu is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 )/c^2 in appropriate units.

Wait, in our earlier substitution, we had units where c=1, so E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

So, E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: approx 29.78*29.78 → 30^2 is 900, but 29.78 is 30 - 0.22. So (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.22^2 → 900 -13.2 +0.0484 → 886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as calculated earlier.

So, E_mu = sqrt(886.8484 + 11172.49 ) = sqrt( 12059.3384 )

What's the square root of 12059.3384? Let's see, 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher. So it's 109.8 maybe.

Wait, 109^2=11881, 110^2=12100.

12059.3384 is between 109^2 and 110^2.

Compute 109.8^2: (110 -0.2)^2 = 110² - 2*110*0.2 +0.2² = 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

Hmm, 109.8^2 is 12056.04. Our target is 12059.3384.

Difference is 12059.3384 -12056.04 =3.2984.

How much more than 109.8?

The derivative of x^2 at x=109.8 is 2*109.8=219.6 ≈ 219.6.

So, delta x ≈ 3.2984 / 219.6 ≈ 0.015.

So, approximately 109.8 +0.015 =109.815.

So E_mu ≈ 109.815 MeV.

So, E_mu is about 109.815 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV.

So, K_mu ≈4.115 MeV.

Earlier, we had K_mu + K_nu =33.9 MeV.

So K_nu=33.9 -4.115=29.785 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The neutrino's energy is p*c, which in our units is p. So p=29.78 MeV/c. So E_nu= p c =29.78 MeV. So K_nu=29.78 MeV.

Which matches the calculation above (since K_nu=33.9 -4.115=29.785).

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.115 MeV for the muon and 29.785 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let me think again about the variables. The pion is at rest, so the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal momentum. So when I solved for x (p) as 29.78 MeV/c, that's correct.

Then, for the muon's energy, I did sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), which is right. So 29.78^2 is about 887, 105.7^2 is 11172, sum is 12059, sqrt is ~109.81 MeV. So K_mu is 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

Neutrino's energy is p=29.78 MeV. So K_nu=29.78 MeV.

Thus, the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV. So option D gives 4.12 and 29.8, which matches closely.

So the answer is option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon, \( \mu^+ \), and a neutrino, \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), while the neutrino is assumed massless (\( m_\nu \approx 0 \)). The goal is to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the muon and neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = m_{\pi^+} c^2.
\]
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+},
\]
and the neutrino's total energy is purely kinetic since it is massless:
\[
E_\nu = K_\nu.
\]
Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = m_{\pi^+} c^2.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = m_{\pi^+} c^2 - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p.
\]
The total energy of the muon is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2}.
\]
The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_\nu = p c.
\]
Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2} + p c = m_{\pi^+} c^2.
\]
Simplifying in natural units (\( c = 1 \)):
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]
Substituting \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Let \( x = p \). Subtracting \( x \) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x + x^2.
\]
Canceling \( x^2 \) and rearranging:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x.
\]
Substituting \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \) and \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \):
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 \cdot x.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
279.2 \cdot x = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]
Thus, the momentum of both the muon and neutrino is \( p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \).

### Kinetic Energies
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} - m_{\mu^+}.
\]
Substituting \( p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
\[
K_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} - 105.7.
\]
Calculating:
\[
29.78^2 \approx 886.85, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} \approx 109.81.
\]
Thus:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_\nu = p c = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
K_{\mu^+} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_\nu \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Answer: D
