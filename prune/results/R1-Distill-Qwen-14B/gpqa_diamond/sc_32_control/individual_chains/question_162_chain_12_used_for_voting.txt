Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature, right? But wait, I'm not too sure about the details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for hyperbolic space. I think hyperbolic space has a metric where the denominator is like (1 + something)², but in this case, it's 4 - x² - y². Oh right, 4 is 2², so maybe this is scaled somehow.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. I remember that for a sphere, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is like a hyperbolic surface, the area might be different. Or wait, maybe it's not straightforward because the metric here is given in a specific form.

Wait, the question is specifically about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So radius is 2. But wait, how does the radius come into play here? Let me think about the metric again.

Looking at the metric: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Wait, 4 is (2)^2. So if I rewrite the denominator as (2^2 - x² - y²), which is (4 - x² - y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/(2²)). So maybe this is a scaled version where the curvature is related to 1/4 or something?

Wait, the general form for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is something like ds² = (dr² + dz² + r² dθ²)/(z²), but I might be mixing up the forms. Alternatively, another parametrization is (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²) + dz², but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the metric given is similar to the Poincaré disk model, where the metric is (4/(a^2(1 - r²)^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where a is the radius related to curvature.

Wait, let me think about the Poincaré disk model. The metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(a²(1 - r²)^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk, and a is the radius of the disk. The curvature is negative, and the magnitude is ( -1/a² ). So in this case, the metric given is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me express it in polar coordinates. Let x² + y² = r², so denominator is (4 - r²). So the metric becomes (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). 

Wait, that looks a bit different. Let me compare. The given metric is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). In the Poincaré disk, the metric is (4/(a² (1 - r²)^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So if I set 32/(4 - r²) equal to 4/(a² (1 - r²)^2 ), perhaps I can find a relation.

Wait, 4 - r² = (2)^2 - r². So 4/(4 - r²) = 1/(1 - (r²)/4). So let me factor out the denominator: 32/(4 - r²) = 8 * (4)/(4 - r²) = 8 * [4/(4 - r²)].

Wait, perhaps I should express it differently. Let me write 4 - r² as 4(1 - (r²)/4). So 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r/2)^2). So the denominator becomes 4(1 - (r/2)^2). So the metric is [32 / (4(1 - (r/2)^2)) ] (dr² + r² dθ²) = (8) [1/(1 - (r/2)^2) ] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Comparing to the Poincaré disk metric, which is (4/(a² (1 - r²)^2 )) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, not exactly the same. Wait, perhaps the standard Poincaré metric is 4/( (1 - r²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ²), with a curvature of -1. So if we have 8/(1 - (r/2)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), that's similar but scaled.

Wait, let me think about the scaling. Let me set r = 2u. So substituting, r = 2u, dr = 2 du. Then the metric becomes [8/(1 - u²)] ( (2 du)^2 + (2u)^2 dθ² ) = [8/(1 - u²)] (4 du² + 4 u² dθ² ) = 8/(1 - u²) * 4 (du² + u² dθ² ) = 32/(1 - u²) (du² + u² dθ² ). 

Wait, that's the same form as the Poincaré metric but with a = something. The standard Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - u^2)^2) (du^2 + u^2 dθ^2 ), but that's when the curvature is -1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the area element.

The area element in 2D is g, the determinant of the metric. So for this metric, it's (32)/(4 - r^2) (dr² + r² dθ² ), so the determinant g is (32)/(4 - r^2). Because it's diagonal, the area element is (32)/(4 - r^2) dr dθ. Wait, no. Wait, the metric is ds² = A (dr² + r² dθ² ), so the determinant is A. So the area element is sqrt(g) dθ dr, but for a diagonal metric, it's just A dr dθ. Wait, no, actually, the area element in polar coordinates for a metric like this would be sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ. Since g_{rr} = A, and g_{θθ} = A r². So sqrt( A * A r² ) dr dθ = A r dr dθ. So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Wait, so to compute the area of the pseudosphere, I need to integrate the area element over the region where the metric is defined. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface, so perhaps it's a two-dimensional surface with this metric. But wait, in this case, the metric is given in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a two-dimensional space. Wait, no, the pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface embedded in three dimensions, but the metric here is for a two-dimensional space (since it's only dx² + dy²). So perhaps this is a two-dimensional hyperbolic space.

So to find the area of the entire space, I would integrate the area element over all possible x and y. Wait, but what is the domain of x and y? The metric denominator is 4 - x² - y², so that must be positive to have a positive metric (since otherwise, it's singular or imaginary). So 4 - (x^2 + y^2) > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x^2 - y^2) ] dx dy.

So let's compute that. Let's switch to polar coordinates. x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because the integrand is radially symmetric, the integral over θ will just contribute a factor of 2π.

So the integral becomes 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let me compute ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution: Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (32 (-du/2) ) / u = ∫ (-16) (1/u) du = -16 ln |u| + C.

So putting it back, the limits when r=0, u=4 -0=4; when r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral from r=0 to 2 is [ -16 ln u ] from u=4 to u=0 → [ (-16 ln 0) ) - (-16 ln 4) ) ].

Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity, so this becomes -16 ( -∞ ) + 16 ln4. But that would be +infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. If the area is infinite, then the options include D) +infty. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the pseudosphere as a surface embedded in 3D and the hyperbolic plane. Oh wait, the given metric is for a two-dimensional hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. So the entire space, which is a hyperbolic plane, has infinite area. But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, pseudospheres, like the tractricoid, have finite area. So perhaps the question is not about the entire hyperbolic plane, but about a specific surface, like a pseudosphere with a certain radius.

Wait, but the metric given is for a two-dimensional space, so perhaps it's the entire hyperbolic plane. So the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, so the area would be D) +infty.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but another approach: I thought that the given metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model has infinite area, as the integral over the disk of radius 2 would diverge. So that's consistent with the result I computed, where the integral gives +infty.

So the answer would be D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional hyperbolic space. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the region of definition is the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a radius of 2. This metric is analogous to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the area element is proportional to \( \frac{1}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \).

To compute the area, the area element in polar coordinates is derived as:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The total area is obtained by integrating this area element over the region \(0 \leq r < 2\) and \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), leaving:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \ln|u| \Big|_{4}^{0}.
\]

Evaluating this gives:

\[
-16 \ln(0) + 16 \ln(4).
\]

Since \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This indicates that the area of the hyperbolic plane described by the given metric is infinite. 

Given that the metric corresponds to a hyperbolic plane, the area is not finite, and the correct answer is:
