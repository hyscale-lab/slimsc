Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

But wait, in this context, the lifetime of the state is related to how long the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime (Δt), the more precisely the energy can be determined, meaning a smaller ΔE uncertainty. Conversely, a shorter lifetime means a larger ΔE uncertainty.

The problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. To clearly resolve them, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be much larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, you can tell them apart.

So each state has its own uncertainty. Let me think: for E1, the lifetime is τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE1 would be roughly ħ / (2 τ1). Similarly for E2, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 τ2). Since τ2 is larger (1e-8 s), ΔE2 is smaller.

Wait, but the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.

The formula I think is ΔE = ħ / τ. Wait, no, wait. The uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 Δt). But the lifetimes given are the average lifetimes τ, which is related to the uncertainty. So τ is approximately the Δt for each state.

So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1) and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2).

But wait, ħ is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s. Let me compute what that is in eV·s. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so ħ in eV·s is about 1.055e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So, for τ1 = 1e-9 s: ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-16 / (2 * 1e-9) ) ≈ (6.58e-16)/(2e-9) = 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, no, let me compute it more carefully. Because the formula is ħ/(2τ), τ in seconds.

So ħ is about 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So for τ1=1e-9 s: ΔE1 = 6.58e-16 / (2 * 1e-9) = 6.58e-16/(2e-9) = 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2=1e-8 s: ΔE2 = 6.58e-16/(2e-8) = 6.58e-16/(2e-8) = 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, no. Let me compute τ2: 1e-8 s.

Wait, τ2 is 1e-8 s, so 2*τ2 is 2e-8 s.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2*τ, so for τ2=1e-8, 2*τ2 is 2e-8. So 6.58e-16 / (2e-8) = 6.58e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

The energy difference between E2 and E1, let's call it ΔE = E2 - E1, needs to be such that it's larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I think. Because for each state, the energy is known within their own ΔE, so to resolve them, their separation must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, no, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than either of the individual uncertainties. Because each state has an uncertainty, but the separation between E1 and E2 must be well beyond either's possible fluctuation. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Let me think of it this way. The energy levels can be thought of as having a spread of ΔE1 for E1, and ΔE2 for E2. So for a spectrometer or measurement, if the separation is much larger than ΔE1 and ΔE2, the two levels can be distinguished. So the energy difference should be larger than, say, the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, because E1's uncertainty is larger than E2's (since τ1 is shorter than τ2). So E1's ΔE is about 3.29e-7 eV, and E2's is about 3.29e-8 eV. So the bigger uncertainty is from E1.

Wait, so the energy difference should be larger than E1's ΔE. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the uncertainty in each, then you can tell them apart.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Because when you have two states, you have two energy measurements. Each has an uncertainty. The energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the measurements could overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE >= ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In this case, ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV. So their sum is approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be at least about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → much smaller than 3.6e-7.

B) 1e-11 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4. Wait, wait, 1e-4 eV is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. Because 3.6e-7 is 0.36e-6, and 1e-4 is 100e-6. So 1e-4 is way larger. So option C is 1e-4 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-7 → which is smaller than 3.6e-7. So D is 1e-8, which is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.001 times 3.6e-7, so it's smaller.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because E1 has a larger uncertainty. So the energy difference should be much bigger than the larger ΔE. For example, if the energy difference is larger than the larger ΔE, then we can distinguish.

In this case, the larger ΔE is ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be much larger than that.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. Wait, wait, no, wait: 1e-4 eV is 1e-4. Let me convert that to exponents. 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 10000 times larger than 3.29e-7 eV (since 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329 eV, and 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV). So 1e-4 is way bigger.

Wait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 10^4 times larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So that would definitely be resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, much smaller than 3.6e-7, so that's not sufficient.

So the correct answer should be option C: 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (related to the lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The uncertainties in energy for each state are approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be much larger than the sum of the uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). The sum of the uncertainties is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be significantly larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the requirement is **Option C**.
