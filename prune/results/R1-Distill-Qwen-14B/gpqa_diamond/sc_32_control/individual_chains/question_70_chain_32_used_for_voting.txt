Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question talks about a series of reactions involving solids and gases, and the products formed. The main goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to point groups in molecular symmetry. Point groups help classify the symmetry of molecules. So, I need to figure out what molecule E is, determine its structure, and then find its point group.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 8 equivalents might suggest a stoichiometric ratio, perhaps something like 1 mole of A reacting with 8 moles of B. I'm thinking of metals reacting with something. Wait, when metals react with gases, maybe it's a metal oxide formation? Or perhaps a reaction forming something like Na2O2, which is bright yellow. But bright red... wait, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur or another element that forms colored products.

Wait, another possibility: If A is a metal, like copper, and B is sulfur, then the reaction would form CuS? But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe A is aluminum and B is something else. Hmm.

But wait, the next reaction says that C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is a product that is hazardous, so maybe it's a gas like HCl or something else, but wait, E is the product of C and D. Let me think about what D could be.

The third reaction is C reacting with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. That suggests that C might be a salt that can undergo hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that, when water is added, forms a metal hydroxide but in this case, the products are two acids. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe C is a sulfide? Because when sulfides react with water, they can produce H2S gas and other products, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle. If C reacts with water to form A, plus two acids F and G. Suppose C is a sulfate or sulfite. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think about a metal carbonate reacting with water? No, that might not produce two acids. Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitride? If C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then when it reacts with water, it would form Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if A is a metal, say copper, and B is sulfur, then C would be CuS. Then, when CuS reacts with water, it might not form two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: Let me look at the other reactions. C reacts with D in a 1:2 molar ratio to form E. So if C is X, and D is Y, then X + 2Y → E. E is extremely hazardous. So what pairs of elements could form such a product? Maybe D is a halogen. Like Cl2? Because if E is something like SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), but that's a possible reaction. Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2, and C is something like S or another element.

Wait, let's think about D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to make H. So if B is, say, O2, then D could be something like H2 (but then H would be H2O, which is a solvent). Alternatively, if B is Cl2, D could be something else. Wait, but in the first reaction, B is a gas reacting with solid A. Let's hypothesize that B is O2. Then, in the first reaction, A (a metal) reacts with O2 to form an oxide, C. Then, when C reacts with D (maybe another gas), perhaps Cl2, to form E.

Alternatively, let's think about B being Cl2. Then, in the first reaction, solid A (a metal) reacts with Cl2 gas to form a chloride. But then, what would the bright red product be? Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a red-colored chloride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, when a solid (C) reacts with water, it produces a metal (A), and two acids. The only way that makes sense is if C is a metal oxide. Because metal oxides reacting with water form metal hydroxides, but that's a base. Hmm, wait, but if C is a non-metal oxide, like SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (a strong acid) and perhaps another product? No, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let me think: If A is a metal, say, Fe, and B is S (sulfur gas), then FeS could be formed. But FeS reacting with water doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is FeS, and when it reacts with water, it forms Fe^2+ (which might precipitate as Fe(OH)2) and H2S gas. Hmm, but H2S is a weak acid (it's a weak acid when dissolved in water). So A would be Fe metal? No, because FeS reacting with water would not produce Fe as a metal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitride. Metal nitrides react with water to form the corresponding metal hydroxide and ammonia (NH3). But ammonia is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit with F and G being acids.

Wait, maybe C is a carbide. For example, CaC2. When CaC2 reacts with water, it produces acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But again, not acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's see: If C is Na2CO3, then reacting with water (H2O) would not produce anything else—it's already in equilibrium with water. But that doesn't fit the description of producing two different acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate? Let's say C is CuSO4. Then, when it reacts with water, it would just form CuSO4·5H2O, but that's not producing two acids. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another approach: Since F and G are acids, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfide. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G is an acid-base reaction, but I'm not seeing it. Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with water, it produces the corresponding metal hydroxide and H2S gas. But H2S is a weak acid. So, perhaps F is H2S, which is a weak acid, and G is another acid. But then what's A?

Wait, maybe I should look at the other reactions. Let's think about reaction C with D to form E. So, E is produced when C reacts with D. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, B and D form H, a solvent.

Possible solvents that are formed from reactions of gases: H2O is a common solvent. So maybe B and D combine to make H2O. For example, B is H2 and D is O2. Then, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So, H is H2O. That makes sense. So B is H2 and D is O2? Or B is O2 and D is H2? Or perhaps B is something else.

Wait, but the first reaction is solid A reacting with B (8 equivalents) to form C. If B is H2, then A could be a metal that reacts with H2 to form a hydride. But that's not common. Alternatively, maybe B is O2, and A is a metal that forms an oxide.

But let's tie this into the other parts. If D is O2, then B is H2. So when B (H2) and D (O2) react in 1:1 ratio, that would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, so H is H2O. So, H is water, a solvent. That makes sense.

So, D is O2 and B is H2.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A reacts with B (H2) in 8 equivalents. So the reaction would be something like A + 8 H2 → C.

Hmm, but I'm not sure what solid A would react with H2 to form product C. Maybe A is a transition metal that forms a compound with H2. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a metal hydride. For example, sodium reacts with H2 to form NaH. But 8 equivalents of H2 would suggest a formula like A H8. Not sure if that's a common compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong. If A is a metal, and B is H2, and 8 equivalents are used, perhaps the reaction is A + 8 H2 → A H8. But what metal can form such a compound? I don't recall any common metal hydrides with such a formula. Maybe I'm on the wrong track here.

Alternative approach: Let's think about product E. E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If D is O2, then C + 2 O2 → E. So E is a product of C and O2. What's a dangerous product of that? Perhaps SO3 or another oxide. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, then reacting with O2 might form SO2 or SO3. But wait, if C is a metal sulfide, like CuS, then reacting with O2 would form CuO and SO2. But SO2 is a dangerous gas. Alternatively, if C is FeS, reaction with O2 might form Fe3O4 and SO2. Hmm.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D (O2), so E could be something like SO3, which is a dangerous gas. Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2O7, but I'm not sure. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- B is H2, D is O2. Because they react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O (solvent H).

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 H2 → C (bright red). What could this be?

If A is a metal, maybe it's reacting with H2 to form a hydride. Alternatively, perhaps it's a non-metal. Wait, could A be sulfur? Sulfur is a solid. Then, 8 equivalents of H2 would form something like SH4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium (Na), and reacts with H2 to form NaH. But 8 H2 would imply NaH8, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B isn't H2. Let's think of another possibility for H. H is formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Another common solvent made from two gases is NH3. But NH3 is made from N2 and H2 in a Haber process, but 1:1 ratio would be N2 + H2 → 2 NH3, which is 3 H2 per N2. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if B is CO2 and D is something else... Not sure.

Wait, maybe H is HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm. Alternatively, H could be something like CH4, but I don't think that's a solvent in this context.

Wait, perhaps H is a different solvent, like ethanol. But that's made from reacting something else. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces a solid metal (A), and two acids. That scenario reminds me of the hydrolysis of a metal nitride or carbide. Wait, but earlier I thought that produces a base. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's think: If C is a metal sulfide, like CuS, then when it reacts with water, it might produce H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But then, the metal hydroxide would not be a solid metal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If C is a sulfite, like CaSO3, reacting with water wouldn't produce much. Alternatively, C could be a sulfate, but again, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. 8 is a multiple of 4, like in the case of sodium reacting with chlorine to form NaCl. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But 8 equivalents would suggest something else. Maybe if each mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B. For example, if A is O, and B is H2, then O + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that's 2 moles of H2, not 8.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2. Then, the reaction could be 2 A + B → 2 AB. But then 8 equivalents would be 4 moles of B. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces a compound where each A atom is surrounded by 8 B atoms. Like, perhaps, a cubic structure. For example, something like PbO2, which is a dark brown solid, but I'm not sure about the color.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas, and each molecule has two atoms. So 8 equivalents would be 4 molecules. Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with a high oxidation state. For example, if A is copper, and B is oxygen, then Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO. But that's a 1:1 ratio, so 8 equivalents would be 8 O2 molecules reacting with 2 Cu atoms. So 2 Cu + 8 O2 → 2 CuO2? Not sure if that's a thing. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is in a +4 oxidation state, like Sn, forming SnO2. But not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Let me think about the color of C. It's bright red. What compounds are bright red? For example, Fe(OH)3 is a red-brown precipitate. But I'm not sure. Another possibility is that C is a sulfide, like CuS, which is black, not red. Or maybe it's a form of mercury(II) oxide, which is red. HgO is mercuric oxide, which is a red solid. So if A is Hg, and B is O2, then 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. But that's a 1:2 ratio, so 8 equivalents would mean 4 O2 reacting with 2 Hg, forming 4 HgO? That doesn't make sense because the stoichiometry is off.

Wait, maybe A is iron, and B is sulfur. Iron reacting with sulfur forms FeS, which is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe Fe reacts with S to form FeS8? I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, perhaps A is lead and B is something else. PbO is lead(II) oxide, which is yellow. PbO2 is lead(IV) oxide, which is dark brown. Hmm, not matching bright red.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a compound of vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but I'm not sure about red. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. MnO2 is a dark purple solid.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonic acid? No, probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the bright red color comes from a different reaction. Maybe it's a precipitate. Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with the color. Let me see if I can find another angle.

The third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed, releases two different acids. One strong, one weak. For example, if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. Wait, but it's more likely that C is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. Because when such salts are hydrolyzed, they produce a weak acid and a strong base, but in this case, we're getting two acids. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride.

Wait, another thought: What if C is a carbonate? For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't really do anything—just remains as is unless acid is present. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. When nitrates react with water, they usually hydrolyze to form nitric acid and other products, but that's more about decomposition under heat.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonamide or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactions in a different manner. Let me think about E. E is produced when C reacts with D (O2) in a 1:2 ratio. If C is a sulfide, reacting with O2 would form SO2 or SO3. Let's say C is CuS. Then, 2 CuS + 3 O2 → 2 CuO + 2 SO2. But that's a possible reaction. SO2 is a dangerous gas. But then E would be a mixture of CuO and SO2. But the question says product E is produced, implying a single product. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is FeS, then FeS + 2 O2 → Fe2O3 + SO2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Let me check: FeS is Fe^2+ and S^2-. When oxidized, Fe^2+ becomes Fe^3+ (Fe2O3), and S^2- becomes SO2^− which is SO2. So the reaction would be 4 FeS + 5 O2 → 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. Hmm, but that's 4 FeS reacting with 5 O2. So in this case, the ratio is 4:5, not 1:2. So that doesn't match the reaction given (C + 2 D → E), which implies 1 mole C reacts with 2 moles D.

Wait, maybe I should think of C as a metal carbide. For example, SiC reacts with O2 to form CO and CO2. But that's more about combustion.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with O2 to form MgO and NO. But I'm not sure about the products.

Wait, but how does this relate to the hydrolysis reaction? If C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then reacting with water would produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try to think of E's structure. E is extremely hazardous, so maybe it's a compound like phosgene (COCl2) or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, could E be something like ClO2? That's a dangerous gas. But how would that form? ClO2 is made from Cl and O2 in certain conditions.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think of all the information together.

So far:

- B and D react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. H is likely H2O, so B and D are H2 and O2.

- Reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C (bright red)

- Reaction 2: C + 2 O2 → E (extremely hazardous)

- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

So if H is H2O, then D is O2 and B is H2.

So, the first reaction is A reacting with 8 H2 to form C.

So, let's think about A as a metal that reacts with hydrogen to form a metal hydride. But what metal reacts with H2 to form something bright red?

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na), and reacts with H2 to form NaH. But sodium hydride is white, not red.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal. For example, if A is vanadium, and B is H2, perhaps it forms a compound that's bright red. Vanadium hydride? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Maybe sulfur? Sulfur is bright yellow, but the product C is bright red.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal and B is another gas, but not H2. Oh wait, earlier I thought H is H2O formed from B and D. So perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Let me try this alternative.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then their reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O (H is H2O). So, B is O2, D is H2.

So, reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red). What solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product? That sounds like a metal oxide. Maybe a transition metal oxide.

Wait, copper oxide is usually black or red. Copper(II) oxide is black, but perhaps another form is red. Alternatively, maybe it's iron(III) oxide, which is reddish brown. Or perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, the reaction of a metal with O2 to form an oxide. Let's say A is copper. Then, 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO (black). Not red. Alternatively, maybe A is lead. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction might be something like 2 Al + 3 O2 → Al2O3. But that's a 2:3 ratio, not 1:8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a direct oxidation but something else. Maybe A is a metal that forms a complex oxide when reacted with O2 in a high ratio. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is another gas. Wait, but earlier I thought B is O2.

Wait, maybe A is a metal and B is Cl2. Wait, but earlier I thought B is O2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me try to think differently. If reaction 3 produces A, which is the original solid, and two acids, perhaps C is a carbonate or another compound that releases the metal upon hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. When it reacts with water, it doesn't change much. Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfate, same issue.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that's amphoteric. For example, Al2O3 reacts with water but doesn't form acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate ester. I'm not making progress here.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces the metal and two different oxyacids. For example, if C is a mixed oxide, like a metal and a non-metal oxide together.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But then the metal hydroxide would be a base, not an acid. So F and G would be a base and a weak acid, which doesn't fit the description.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about E again. E is a product of C and D (O2), 1:2 ratio. E is extremely hazardous. So, what's a dangerous compound formed from a reaction of a substance with O2 in a 1:2 ratio?

Wait, maybe E is a peroxide. Like H2O2. But how? C would need to be H2O, but that doesn't fit the earlier reactions.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), but that's formed from O2 via electrical discharge, not a reaction with another compound.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe E is a chlorofluorocarbon, but I don't see the connection.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure how that would form from C and O2.

Wait, another angle: If C is a sulfide, then reacting with O2 would produce SO2 and the metal oxide. But SO2 is a dangerous gas, so E could be SO2. But SO2 isn't a product of a 1:2 ratio. Let me check the reaction: For example, 4 FeS + 5 O2 → 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. So moles of FeS : O2 → 4:5. So if C is FeS, then 4 moles C react with 5 O2 to form 4 SO2 and Fe2O3. But the question says 1 mole C reacts with 2 O2 to form E. So the ratio is 1:2, which would require a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. Then, E would be CO, which is toxic. But CO is a colorless gas, not sure if that's extremely hazardous in this context.

Wait, but the question says E is extremely hazardous, which fits with CO being toxic.

But in that case, the reaction would be 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. So for 1 mole C, 0.5 moles O2 are needed. But the problem states 2 equivalents of D, which is O2. So 1 mole C + 2 O2 → 2 CO. That would require the reaction 3 C + 4 O2 → 6 CO (but that's 3 C and 4 O2 → 6 CO). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O7, which is a highly toxic gas. But how would that form? Cl2O7 is formed by the dehydration of HClO4. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a chlorine compound. For example, Cl2O is dichlorine monoxide, which is a gas but I'm not sure about its properties.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on identifying E.

Let me take a step back. The question is about the molecular symmetry of E. So, regardless of what E is, I need to find its point group.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Point groups are determined by the symmetry elements present in the molecule. For example:

- C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis.
- D4h: has a principal axis with four-fold rotation, plus horizontal mirror planes and inversion.
- D∞h: infinitely long molecule with a principal axis and mirror planes.
- C2v: a 2-fold rotation axis plus two vertical mirror planes.

So, what molecules have these symmetries?

- D4h is common in molecules like SO4^2- (sulfate ion), which has a tetrahedral structure but with certain symmetries. Alternatively, molecules like benzene have D6h symmetry, but that's not one of the options here.

Wait, D4h symmetry would include molecules like XeO4 (which has a square planar structure?), but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. Wait, no, SO2 has a bent structure with a bond angle around 119 degrees. Its point group is D2h, but that's not an option here. Hmm.

Wait, another molecule: ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure with C3v symmetry, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, O3 (ozone) has a bent structure with a C2v point group. Ozone has a central O with two others attached, and a lone pair. So, it has a 2-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, plus two mirror planes. So its point group is C2v.

If E is O3, then the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But wait, would O3 fit as E? Let me see.

If E is O3, then it's formed from C and D (O2). So, C would have to be something that reacts with O2 to form O3. How?

O3 is formed by the reaction of O2 with excess ozone or via electrical discharge. Not typically via a reaction with another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O2 itself, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe E is a peroxide, like H2O2. H2O2 has a structure with two O-O single bonds. Wait, no, H2O2 has the structure H-O-O-H. Its point group is C2v because it has a 2-fold rotation axis through the central O-O bond and two mirror planes. So, yes, H2O2 has C2v symmetry.

But how would H2O2 form from C and O2? Let me think. If C is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's not producing H2O2. Alternatively, maybe C is another compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is HO-OH (hydrogen peroxide). But that's not likely.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is H2O2, then the reaction would be C + O2 → H2O2. But I don't know what C would be in that case.

Alternatively, maybe E is a different molecule. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another dangerous gas with high symmetry: phosgene (COCl2). Phosgene has a central carbon atom with two O and two Cl atoms. The structure is planar, with a C2v symmetry because there's a central C=C axis and two mirror planes. So, its point group is C2v.

So, if E is phosgene (COCl2), then its symmetry group is C2v, option D.

But how would that fit into the reactions? Let me see.

If E is COCl2, then it's formed from C and O2. So, C would have to be something that reacts with O2 to form COCl2. That doesn't seem straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe E is a dimer of O2. O2 dimerizes into O4, but I don't think that's a common molecule. Alternatively, maybe E is a different form of oxygen, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: E could be a chlorate or perchlorate. For instance, ClO3^- or ClO4^- salts. But those are ions, not neutral molecules.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2O, dichlorine monoxide, which is a gas. Cl2O has a structure similar to O3, with a central Cl and two O atoms. Its point group would be C2v, same as O3.

If E is Cl2O, then its symmetry is C2v.

But how is Cl2O formed? It can be formed by the reaction of Cl2 with O2 in the presence of a catalyst, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO, but that's speculative.

Hmm, I'm not sure, but perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the point groups.

The options are:

A) C2: which has a single 2-fold rotation axis.

B) D4h: which is a higher symmetry group, common in molecules like SO4^2-.

C) D∞h: which is for linear molecules with infinite symmetry, like CO2 or HCN.

D) C2v: which includes O3, H2O2, Cl2O, etc.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, O3 and phosgene are both toxic. But considering the reaction conditions, perhaps E is O3, which is formed from O2 via electrical discharge. But the reaction given is C + 2 O2 → E. If E is O3, then perhaps C is O, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O, which is a toxic gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the hydrolysis reaction.

C + H2O → A + F + G

F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a metal (A) and two acids. For example, if C is a sulfite salt, then hydrolysis could produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, say FeS, then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)2 (a base) and H2S (weak acid). But in this case, F and G would be a base and an acid, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, hydrolysis would produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). But again, F and G would be a base and acid, not both acids.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of C as a compound that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis. Maybe a sulfonate ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH4NO3, but that's not likely.

Wait, another idea: What if C is a sulfonamide? Like H2N-SO2-NH2. Upon hydrolysis, it could produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base). But that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfamic acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the possible point groups.

If E has a molecular symmetry of C2v, which includes O3 and similar molecules, then option D would be the answer.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like COCl2 (phosgene), which also has C2v symmetry, then D would be the correct option.

Given that, I'm going to go with option D) C2v.

The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction Breakdown**:
   - Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
   - C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid).
   - D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - H is identified as H₂O, a common solvent, implying B and D are likely H₂ and O₂, respectively, since they combine in a 1:1 ratio to form water (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O).
   - Reaction 1 involves A (solid) reacting with 8 equivalents of B (H₂) to form C (bright red). This suggests A could be a metal that forms a red oxide or a compound with hydrogen.
   - Reaction 2 involves C reacting with 2 equivalents of O₂ to form E, an extremely hazardous product. This implies E could be a toxic gas or compound formed from C and O₂.
   - Reaction 3 indicates that C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). This suggests C could be a compound that hydrolyzes to release acids.

3. **Symmetry Group Analysis**:
   - The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
     - **C2**: A single 2-fold rotation axis.
     - **D4h**: A higher symmetry group with a principal 4-fold axis, horizontal mirror planes, and inversion.
     - **D∞h**: Symmetry for linear molecules with infinite symmetry, such as CO₂ or HCN.
     - **C2v**: A 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, common in molecules like O₃ (ozone) or H₂O₂ (hydrogen peroxide).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - E is described as extremely hazardous. Based on the reactions and symmetry groups, E could be a molecule like ozone (O₃) or hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), both of which have **C2v** symmetry. Ozone, for example, has a bent structure with a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, fitting the **C2v** classification.
   - Other options, such as D4h or D∞h, are less likely because they describe higher symmetry groups not consistent with the likely structure of E. C2 is also less likely because it lacks the additional mirror planes present in C2v.

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C2v**.
