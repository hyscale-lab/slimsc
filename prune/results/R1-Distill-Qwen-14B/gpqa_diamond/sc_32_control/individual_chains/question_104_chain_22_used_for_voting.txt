Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The movement of the star towards and away from us shifts the spectral lines, and by measuring that shift, we can infer the presence of a planet.

The setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So, both planets are probably in the same mass range, but the question is about their orbital periods.

They detected Planet #1 with a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Hmm. Wait, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. I think the formula involves the velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula I vaguely remember is:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )

Wait, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 day)^(−1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the relation between K and the orbital period. I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period P through some factors.

Wait, I think I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) ) ] / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But since e is zero here (the orbits are circular), and M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So simplifying:

K ≈ [ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p) ) ] / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe another approach.

I remember that for the same star (same M_star) and same M_planet, the semi-amplitude K depends on the orbital period P. So if we have two planets with the same M_planet and M_star, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because when P increases, the orbital speed decreases, so K would be smaller.

Wait, more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )

But since e is zero, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, or is it that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the formula in terms of the observed velocity. So, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ] * [ 1 / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(0.5) ) ]

Wait, but again, e is zero, and M_planet is much smaller, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So this becomes K ≈ (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of the ratio K1/K2, since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar mass (so M_p1 ≈ M_p2).

So, let me think: K1 is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )) )

Similarly, K2 is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both, the ratio K1/K2 is proportional to sqrt( P1 / P2 )? Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no: K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, because K1 = C / P1^(1/3) → P1 = (C / K1 )^3

Similarly, P2 = (C / K2 )^3

So P2 / P1 = ( (C/K2)^3 ) / ( (C/K1)^3 ) ) = ( (K1/K2) )^3

So P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, let me double-check that.

Let me write P1 = (C/K1)^3

P2 = (C/K2)^3

So P2/P1 = (C/K2)^3 / (C/K1)^3 ) = ( (K1/K2) )^3 )

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So if K1 is smaller than K2, then (K1/K2) is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 is even smaller, so P2 is smaller than P1.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the shift for Planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2 it's 7. So K1=5, K2=7.

Wait, no, because the shift is the semi-amplitude. So the semi-amplitude K (velocity) is proportional to the shift in wavelength. Because the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity. So higher velocity gives a larger shift.

So, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K2 > K1.

Therefore, K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning that Planet #2's period is shorter than Planet #1's. So the period of Planet #2 is 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, no: the question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

Wait, no, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

Wait, no, the question is, P2 longer than P1? So if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then it's shorter. So the ratio would be 0.36 times. So 0.36 times as long, meaning planet #2's period is shorter by a factor of approximately 3. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I have the formula right.

Wait the formula is P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Since K2 is larger than K1 (K2=7, K1=5), K1/K2 is 5/7.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's more than three times shorter.

But the question is asking, how much longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if P2 is shorter, then the answer is less than 1.

So the ratio P2/P1 = 0.364, so P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer is approx 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but let me recheck the direction. Because if the shift is larger (K2 is larger), that implies a shorter period, right?

Because a larger K would mean the star is moving faster. So a faster movement could imply a shorter period, because the planet is closer in, so it's moving faster around the star.

Yes, so a larger K implies a shorter period. So since K2 is larger, its period is shorter, so P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so P2 is ~0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That is, P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter, not longer. But the question is phrased as "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So the answer would be about 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because if the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, then it's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is A.

So I think the correct answer is A) ~0.36.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), which can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the two planets have similar masses, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) directly relates to the ratio of their orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \). Specifically:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

**Options:**
- A) ~0.36
- B) ~1.40
- C) ~1.96
- D) ~0.85

The correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.
