Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which is important because it tells me about the coordinate system we're working in.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared for the given state.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩.

First, I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value of Pz in the state |ψ⟩. Since Pz is a diagonal matrix (because the basis vectors are its eigenvectors), the expectation value is just the sum of the products of each basis component's amplitude squared multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, more accurately, since Pz is diagonal, ⟨Pz⟩ is the sum over ψ's components squared multiplied by the diagonal entries of Pz.

Looking at the matrix of Pz:
- The (1,1) entry is ħ, so the eigenvalue for the first basis vector is ħ.
- The (2,2) entry is 0, so eigenvalue 0.
- The (3,3) entry is -ħ.

So the state |ψ⟩ has components a = -1/2 (first component), b = 1/sqrt(2) (second), c = -1/2 (third).

The expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ would be |a|² * ħ + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ).

Calculating each term:
|a|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)*ħ
|b|² = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2 → (1/2)*0 = 0
|c|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 → (1/4)*(-ħ) = -ħ/4

So adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 - (1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Next, I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix Pz² will have entries (ħ^2, 0, (ħ)^2), wait no, wait:

Wait, no, Pz matrix is:

[ ħ 0 0 ]
[ 0 0 0 ]
[ 0 0 -ħ ]

So Pz squared is each element squared:

[ (ħ)^2 0 0 ]
[ 0 0 0 ]
[ 0 0 ( -ħ )^2 ] → [ ħ² 0 0; 0 0 0; 0 0 ħ² ]

Wait, no, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ², right. So Pz squared is indeed diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

To find ⟨Pz²⟩, I multiply |ψ⟩ by Pz squared and then take the inner product with itself, but since Pz is diagonal, and the basis is orthonormal, it's easier to compute as:

⟨Pz²⟩ = |a|² * (ħ²) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (ħ²)

So substituting the values:

|a|² = 1/4 → (1/4) * ħ²
|b|² = 1/2 → (1/2)*0 = 0
|c|² = 1/4 → (1/4)*ħ²

Adding these: (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 ) → sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait a minute, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), right?

Wait, but wait. I should double-check all my steps.

First, about the state vector. The components are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me check if these sum to 1 when squared:

(1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1. So yes, it's a normalized state.

Then, ⟨Pz⟩ is indeed zero because the positive and negative contributions cancel. And ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = ½ ħ².

So the uncertainty is sqrt(½ ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$ on the diagonal. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with entries $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $|a|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|b|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|c|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
