Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite quantities that pop up when you calculate certain processes. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method, and then you take the limit as the cutoff is removed. But wait, not all theories need this?

Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical electromagnetism, you don't deal with the same divergences because it's not a quantum field theory. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same infinities. But wait, isn't there something about self-energy in classical theories? Like, the problem of point charges leading to infinite self-energy? Oh, right, but that's more of a conceptual issue and not handled by regularization. So perhaps in the context of regularization, which is a quantum field theory tool, classical theories wouldn't require it. So D might be the right answer.

But let me go through the other options too to make sure.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a theory that tries to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Since it's a theory of quantum gravity, it might have issues with divergences, but wait, string theory is supposed to be finite, right? Or does it still require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I remember that in string theory, the interactions are handled by the string worldsheet and that it doesn't suffer from the same divergences as point-particle theories because of the way the interactions are regulated. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization. But I'm not entirely sure. So this could be a candidate.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory and has asymptotic freedom. I know that in QCD, calculations can lead to divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So they must use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization to handle those infinities. So B definitely requires regularization.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-understood quantum field theory. When you calculate things like the electron self-energy or the photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. To handle these, you use regularization techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or others. So QED does require regularization. So option C is not the answer.

So, the options are A, D. Now I need to decide between them.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which of the four is a theory that doesn't have such issues.

Wait, string theory, option A, is a theory that is supposed to be finite, meaning it doesn't have divergences. So maybe it doesn't require regularization. But then, superstring theory is a quantum theory, so it's a QFT in some sense. Or maybe it's an alternative approach that avoids the same divergences.

Wait, but another thought: regularization is a tool used in perturbative calculations. If a theory is free from divergences, then you don't need regularization. So which of these theories is finite?

I think that in the Standard Model, all the forces except gravity are described by QFTs which require regularization. But in string theory, the perturbative expansion is different. But I'm not sure if they use regularization in string theory calculations. Alternatively, maybe string theory calculations don't require it because their perturbation theory is inherently finite.

Alternatively, maybe classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same issues. So D, classical electrodynamics, doesn't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, in reality, classical ED has its own problems, like the infinite self-energy of a point charge, but you don't fix that with regularization. You might use other methods, like considering distributions or approximate solutions. So in the context of regularization being a quantum field theory technique, classical theories just don't require it. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if D is a classical theory, it doesn't need regularization because regularization is a QFT thing. So D is the correct answer.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options as follows:

1. **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
   Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity. It is unique because it is finite and does not suffer from the same divergences as point-particle quantum field theories. This is due to the nature of string interactions, which inherently avoid certain types of divergences. Therefore, Superstring Theory does not require regularization.

2. **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
   QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and is a non-abelian gauge theory. Calculations in QCD, particularly loop diagrams, often lead to divergences. To handle these, regularization techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization are used. Thus, QCD requires regularization.

3. **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
   QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-established quantum field theory. It is known to produce divergent integrals in calculations such as electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. Regularization techniques are essential to manage these divergences. Therefore, QED requires regularization.

4. **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
   Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve the same divergences as quantum field theories. While it has conceptual issues like the infinite self-energy of point charges, these are not addressed through regularization, which is a quantum field theory tool. Hence, Classical Electrodynamics does not require regularization.

Between the candidates, **Superstring Theory (A)** and **Classical Electrodynamics (D)** are potential answers. However, the question specifies "physical theories" in a broader sense, and regularization is a tool specific to quantum field theories. Since Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not require regularization in the context of quantum field theory, it is the most appropriate answer.
