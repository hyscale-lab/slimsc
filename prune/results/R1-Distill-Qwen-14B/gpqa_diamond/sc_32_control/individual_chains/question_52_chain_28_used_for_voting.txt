Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, when stars have spots, it changes their overall temperature, which in turn affects the spectral lines we observe.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots are present, the overall temperature of the photosphere must be lower than when there are no spots.

The question asks about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower than when there are none.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two levels, say level 2 and level 1, is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So the ratio depends on the ratio of the statistical weights (g2/g1) and the exponential term involving the temperature.

The transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. But wait, the wavelength might not directly affect the calculation here. Maybe it's just additional info.

The key here is that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the temperature in the photosphere is lower, which would affect the exponential term. Since the energy difference (E2-E1) is positive (assuming level 2 is higher than level 1), a lower temperature T would lead to a larger exponent, making the exponential term smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease when T decreases.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that makes sense because the spots cause a lower Teff, leading to a lower ratio.

But the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Let me write down the formula for each case. Let’s denote the ratio without spots as R1 and with spots as R2.

R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because the exponent in R1 is -ΔE/(k T1) and R2 is -ΔE/(k T2). So when you take the ratio R1/R2, it's exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2) ) / exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait no, R1 is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 is exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So R1/R2 = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Alternatively, that's the same as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent as (1/T2 - 1/T1) times ΔE/k.

But let's compute the value numerically. First, I need to find ΔE, but wait, the energy difference is related to the wavelength of the transition. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So ΔE = hc/λ.

Given λ = 1448 Ångströms. Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So λ = 1448e-10 m.

Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s.
Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m → 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately:

1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * (1e-25 / 1e-7) ) = about 1.37 * 1e-18 = 1.37e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.37e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.37/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5 K. Let me calculate more precisely:

1.37 / 1.38 = approx 0.993. So 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99,300 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,300 K.

Now, the exponent is [1/T2 - 1/T1] multiplied by ΔE/(k).

Wait, no, earlier I thought the factor is exp(ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. The ratio R1/R2 is exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because R1 is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 is exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), so R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no: R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Yes, correct.

So substituting the values:

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Compute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 5 / 330,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ≈ 99300 K * (1.515e-5) ≈ 99300 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute 99300 * 1.515e-5.

Well, 99300 is about 9.93e4. 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93 * 1.515 * 1e-1 = (approx 15.04) * 0.1 = 1.504.

So the exponent is about 1.504.

So exp(1.504) is approximately what?

I know that exp(1) is about 2.718, exp(1.5) is about 4.4817, and exp(1.6) is about 4.953. Let me compute 1.504 more accurately.

The value of 1.504 is between 1.5 and 1.51. Let me use a Taylor series or approximate it.

Alternatively, I can note that ln(4.5) is approximately 1.504 because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, yes.

Wait, yes, ln(4.5) ≈ 1.5040774. So exp(1.504) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but let me check:

4.5 is option C. So the factor is ~4.5, which is option C.

But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, R2 = ratio with spots is lower than R1. So R1/R2 is the factor by which the ratio increases when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So the factor is about 4.5. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\Delta E / k\)
Boltzmann's constant is \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.37 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the temperature difference term
The effective temperatures are \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The term \(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the exponent
The exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) \approx (99,300)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.504.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the factor
The factor is:

\[
\exp(1.504) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately **4.5 times higher** when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.
