Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding probabilities and an average value of an operator given a specific state. 

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think that means |alpha> = k*(1+i)|up> + k*(2-i)|down>, where k is a normalization constant. Because the state has to be normalized, the sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1. So I'll need to find k first.

Wait, wait. Actually, since it's proportional, I can set the state as |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> and then normalize it. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2). 

Let me calculate |1+i|^2: that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because for a complex number a+bi, the magnitude squared is a² + b². So |1+i|=sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

Then |2-i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2+5) = 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is alpha = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next part of the problem is about the operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, the operator is a 2x2 matrix, I suppose, since it's acting on spin states (up and down).

So, the matrix should have 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. Because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2, else 0. So the matrix looks like:
[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, the indices go i=1,2 and j=1,2. So when i=1 and j=2, and i=2 and j=1, we have A_ij = ħ/2. Else, 0.

So this operator is similar to the Pauli X matrix, which has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on. But Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_x matrix.

Wait, because the Pauli X matrix is sigma_x, so the operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates, which are the |+x> and |-x> states. But wait, perhaps I should check that. Because the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

But the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, because A is a scalar multiple of sigma_x. So the eigenstates are the same.

So the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenstates can be expressed as |+> and |->, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the eigenstates of sigma_x are different from those of sigma_z, which are |up> and |down>.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (or project |alpha> onto these eigenstates) and find the square of the amplitudes, which will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues are plus and minus (ħ/2). But the question is about measuring in the eigenstates of A, which are the eigenstates of sigma_x.

So, let's compute the probability of |alpha> being in the |+x> state. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product < +x | alpha > would be the amplitude, and the probability is the square of the absolute value.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, the eigenstates of A are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates. So let's write |+x> and |-x> as the eigenstates.

So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think that's correct. Let me check: the eigenstates of sigma_x are those states because sigma_x |+x> = |+x> and sigma_x |-x> = -| -x>.

Wait, perhaps I should write this as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think I have a sign incorrect. Let me remember: sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So for |+x>, sigma_x |+x> = +|+x>, so:

sigma_x |+x> = |+x>

sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps up and down. So if |+x> = a|up> + b|down>, then sigma_x |+x> = a|down> + b|up> = a|up> + b|down> = |+x> => a = b and a = b. So to satisfy this, a must equal b. Also, since |+x> is normalized, a² + b² =1, so a = b=1/sqrt(2). So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, |-x> would be (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), because when you apply sigma_x, it becomes (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) = (-1)(|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = -| -x>.

So, the two eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as above.

So now, to find the probability that the state |alpha> is in |+x> or |-x>, we compute the squared modulus of the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

But first, let's write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So, let's compute the inner product < +x | alpha >.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ) + ... wait, no, wait. No, more accurately:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

Because <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7). 

So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Adding those numerators: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (3) / sqrt(7) )

= 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14)

The probability is the square of the absolute value, so (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which sums to 1, so that's possible.

Wait, but wait, let me recount. Because 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643. So perhaps that's where option A's 0.64 comes from. But let me check the other eigenstate's probability.

Compute < -x | alpha >:

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ].

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute the numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) * ( (-1 + 2i) ) / sqrt(7) )

= ( (-1 + 2i) ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) )

The probability is the square of the absolute value.

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2 *7) ) → (1 +4)/(14) ) =5/14≈0.357, which is 0.357. So 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. But none of the options exactly match. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64 and 0.36. 0.64 +0.36=1. So close to what I have.

Wait, but I got 9/14 = 0.642857 and 5/14≈0.3571. So 0.6429 is about 0.643, which is close to 0.64. So option A would have probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, which are 0.6428 and 0.3571, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm, that's a bit off, but perhaps the exact fractions are 9/14 and 5/14. Are those the exact options?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

Wait, but the average value comes next. So perhaps I should compute the average value now.

The average value of operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the average value is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

But sigma_x has expectation value given by the expectation value in the state |alpha>. Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the average would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <A> directly.

Wait, but sigma_x has matrix elements [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A has matrix elements (ħ/2) times that. So A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]

So the operator's matrix is:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

The expectation value is alpha† A alpha. So let's compute this.

But |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>. Let's represent alpha as a vector.

Alpha = [ a, b ]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7) and b= (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

But wait, in the Dirac notation, |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, so when written as a column vector in the basis {|up>, |down>}, it's [a; b]^T.

So, the expectation value is alpha† A alpha.

A is a 2x2 matrix, so:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

So, alpha is [a; b], so alpha† is [a*, b*].

So, alpha† A alpha = [a*, b*] * A * [a; b] 

Multiplying A by [a; b]:

A [a; b] = [ (0*a) + (ħ/2)*b, (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ]

= [ (ħ/2) b ; (ħ/2) a ]

Then, [a*, b*] multiplied by this gives:

a* * (ħ/2 b) + b* * (ħ/2 a )

= (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

But a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b )

Which is 2 times the real part of a* b.

So, putting it together:

Expectation value <A> = (ħ/2) * 2 Re(a* b) = ħ Re(a* b )

So, compute a* and b.

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = [ (1 - i)(2 - i) ] / (7).

Multiply numerator:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) 

= 2 -i - 2i + i² 

= 2 -3i + (-1) (since i² = -1) 

= 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part of this is 1/7.

So <A> = ħ * (1/7) )= ħ/7.

Wait, but let me recalculate a* b. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, (1 - i) (2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

Which is 2 -3i + (-1) = (2-1) -3i = 1 -3i. Yes, that's correct.

So Re(a* b) is 1/7, so <A> = ħ * (1/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. That seems to match.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the probabilities, I got 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571. So option A's first two numbers are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 0.6429 and 0.3571, but not exact. Perhaps the problem expects an exact answer, so maybe I should express the probabilities as exact fractions.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, which is approximately 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which would round to 0.36. So option A's probabilities would be 9/14 (0.643) and 5/14 (0.357). So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. And the average value is ħ/7, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the average value calculation. Because I might have missed something.

Wait, another approach: since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the average is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is given by (alpha | sigma_x | alpha ).

Which is equal to [a*, b*] * sigma_x [a; b].

Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so sigma_x [a; b] = [b; a].

So [a*, b*] * [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

Which is 2 Re(a* b ), as I calculated before.

So sigma_x's expectation is 2 Re(a* b ) / ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ), but wait, no, the expectation value is just Re(a* b ) *2?

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing normalization.

Wait, |alpha> is already normalized, so <sigma_x> = 2 Re(a* b ). Because:

sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation is (a* b + b* a) = 2 Re(a* b ).

So this gives <sigma_x> = 2 Re(a* b ), which is 2*(1/7) )= 2/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the average is ħ/7, which matches option A.

But let me check the other options:

Option D says average is 2ħ/sqrt(7). Hmm, that's much larger. So probably not. The options are A, B, C, D.

So the conclusion is that the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.643) and 5/14 (≈0.357), and the average is ħ/7. So the option that matches is A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state is proportional to \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, compute the normalization constant \( k \) using the condition \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). The squared magnitudes of the coefficients are:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5.
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is:
\[
k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2+5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
The normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), with \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
Thus, the eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are given by the squared magnitudes of the projections of \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). Compute the inner products:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right),
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]
Substitute \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \):
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle^* \right).
\]
Substitute \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( \frac{3 - i}{7} \right) = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.643 \) and \( 0.357 \), which round to \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
