Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The state of the system is provided as a column vector.

Alright, so first, what's the formula for the uncertainty in an observable? Oh right, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of (P_z squared) minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, since P_z is an operator, I need to compute these expectation values. The state is given, so I can compute the expectation values using that state.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's write that as |ψ> = [ -1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2 ]? Wait, no, wait. The given elements are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the second component is 1/sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.707. So the state is a three-component vector.

The matrix for P_z is given as:

First row: (ℏ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ℏ)

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

Since the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, that simplifies things because each component of the state corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

Wait, if the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, then each basis vector is |k>, where P_z |k> = k |k>, with k being the eigenvalues. So the first basis vector is associated with eigenvalue ℏ, the second with 0, and the third with -ℏ.

But the state in question is given as a linear combination of these basis vectors. So the state vector [a; b; c] would mean a|1> + b|2> + c|3>, where |1>, |2>, |3> are the eigenvectors of P_z with eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ respectively.

So the state is |ψ> = (-1/2)|1> + (1/sqrt(2))|2> + (-1/2)|3>.

But wait, let me check the given vector: it's [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. So the first component is -1/2, second is 1/sqrt(2), third is -1/2.

Now, to compute the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

That is, ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * ℏ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ℏ).

So let's compute |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2.

a is -1/2, so |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
b is 1/sqrt(2), so |b|^2 is (1/2).
c is -1/2, so |c|^2 is 1/4.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ)
= (1/4 - 1/4)ℏ = 0.

So the expectation value is zero.

Next, the expectation value of P_z squared, ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix is:

[ℏ², 0, 0;
 0, 0, 0;
 0,0, ℏ²].

So again, since the state is in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is each probability times the eigenvalue squared.

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|^2 * (ℏ)^2 + |b|^2 * 0^2 + |c|^2 * (ℏ)^2
= (1/4) ℏ² + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ℏ²)
= (1/4 + 1/4) ℏ²
= (1/2) ℏ².

So now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ℏ²) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ℏ²) ) = (ℏ / sqrt(2)).

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Because P_z is diagonal, the expectation values are straightforward. The state is expressed in the basis of P_z, so each component corresponds directly to an eigenvalue.

Yes, so the expectation of P_z is 0, and the expectation of P_z squared is (1/4 + 1/4) * ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2) ℏ² ) = (ℏ / sqrt(2)).

Looking at the options, option B is ℏ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me compute |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2 again.

a is -1/2: |a|^2 is (1/2)^2=1/4 = 0.25
b is 1/sqrt(2): |b|^2 is (1/2) = 0.5
c is -1/2: same as a, so 0.25.

So for ⟨P_z⟩, sum is 0.25 * ℏ + 0.5 * 0 + 0.25*(-ℏ) = 0.25 ℏ - 0.25 ℏ = 0.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is 0.25 * ℏ², 0.5 * 0, 0.25 * ℏ². So sum is 0.5 ℏ².

So yeah, the uncertainty is sqrt(0.5ℏ²) = ℏ sqrt(0.5) = ℏ / sqrt(2). So that's option B.

To determine the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator \( P_z \), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of \( P_x \), and the state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix \( P_z \) is diagonal with eigenvalues \( \hbar, 0, -\hbar \), and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of \( P_z \). This means the components of \( |\psi\rangle \) correspond directly to the eigenvalues of \( P_z \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle P_z \rangle \)
The expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where \( a = -1/2 \), \( b = 1/\sqrt{2} \), and \( c = -1/2 \). The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \)
The operator \( P_z^2 \) is diagonal with eigenvalues \( \hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2 \). The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0^2 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \Delta P_z \)
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
