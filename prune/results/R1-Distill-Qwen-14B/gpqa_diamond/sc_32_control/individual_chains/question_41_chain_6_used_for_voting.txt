Okay, so I have this physics problem about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Specifically, it's c divided by the refractive index. Oh right, so in the glass, the speed of light would normally be v_glass = c / n. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer.

But in this case, the glass is moving. So I think I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity. Because velocities don't just add linearly when things are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. Oh, but wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so units are in terms of c? Hmm, that might simplify things.

Wait, no, the glass is moving at velocity v. Since the glass is a medium, the speed of light in it is v_glass = 1/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Let me think about it. So the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light's speed in the medium is 1/n. But when the medium is moving, the observer in the lab would see a different speed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. How do the velocities add in this scenario? I think it's the relativistic addition formula, but wait, v is the speed of the glass in the lab frame. So the light's speed in the glass frame is 1/n, but what's the speed in the lab frame?

Wait, no, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is inside the glass, so in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n. But how do we transform that to the lab frame?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Because the index of refraction affects the speed, but the speed of light in a medium is always c/n regardless of the medium's motion. Wait, no, that's not right. Because from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed could be different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the frame transformations. The glass's rest frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light's speed is 1/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the velocity addition applies when you have an object moving at u in the S' frame, and you want to find its speed u' in the S frame, where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But in this case, the light's speed in the glass (S') is u = 1/n. Wait no, because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_glass = c/n, which is 1/n since c=1.

Wait, but if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer (so in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, which is towards the observer), then the light's speed in the lab frame is u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v), since c=1.

Wait, so substituting u = 1/n, the speed in the lab would be (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v).

But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A is (1 + n*v)/(n + v). Wait, let me compute my expression. Let me write u = 1/n, so:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v) = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (v/n) ].

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v) / n

Denominator: (n + v) / n

So overall, [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Which is exactly option A. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but why does the direction matter? Oh, because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So when we add the velocities, it's u + v, but in the same direction.

Wait, another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So the light is moving through the glass towards the observer. Hmm, but the formula still holds because the velocity addition is correct.

So yeah, the correct formula gives (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A.

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in Glass**: The speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{glass}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. Since \( c = 1 \) (as given), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Relative Motion of the Glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. To find the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv}
   \]
   Here, \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame.

3. **Substitute Values**: Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Simplify the numerator and denominator:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1 + nv}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Match with Options**: The derived expression \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \) matches option **A**.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by option **A**.
