Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of synthesis reactions. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's draw the target molecule. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 2 has a tert-butyl group, position 1 has an ethoxy group, and position 3 has a nitro group. Wait, wait, numbering might be tricky here. Let me think about the substituents. Wait, the compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering starts with the ethoxy as position 1, then tert-butyl as position 2, and nitro as position 3. So positions 1, 2, 3 are all adjacent? So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other? Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let me clarify: benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl is at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro is at 3 (meta to ethoxy). So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3, which are adjacent. So the ring has three substituents in a row. Hmm, or wait, no, in benzene, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups, but the exact order? Let me think about the substituents.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering must be such that substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So the substituents are in a row, each at adjacent positions. So the ring would have ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

But wait, when you number a benzene ring, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So I need to arrange the substituents correctly so that the numbering gives the correct positions. So the substituents are in the order 1 being ethoxy, 2 being t-Bu, and 3 being nitro. So the substituents are adjacent to each other.

Now, the synthesis steps. I need to figure out which reagents would introduce these substituents in the correct order, considering directing effects and reaction conditions.

Benzene is the starting material. Let's think about each substituent and how they can be introduced.

The substituents are:

- tert-butyl (a strong activating, o/p-directing group)
- ethoxy (activating, o/p-directing)
- nitro (deactivating, m-directing)

Wait, no. The ethoxy group is an activating group because it's an electron-donating OMe group. Wait, no, ethoxy is OEt, which is an activating, o/p-directing group. Nitro is deactivating, meta-directing.

Wait, but the substituents in the target have nitro at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy at position 1. So perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and t-Bu groups. Or maybe not. Let's think about the order of introducing groups.

In Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the tert-butyl group would be introduced. Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. But if I introduce a nitro group first, which is deactivating, it would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So probably, the nitro group is introduced last, or after activating groups.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing, so when it's introduced, it would influence the positions of substituents added after it. But if we introduce nitro after activating groups, then the activating groups would direct the next substituents.

Wait, the problem is that nitro is a meta director, but perhaps it's better to introduce nitro after activating groups have been placed.

Wait, let me think: the target has three substituents. Let me consider for each substituent when it's introduced.

Suppose we start with benzene. Let me plan the order of introducing substituents.

Option 1: Introduce the ethoxy group first, then the t-Bu, then nitro.

But wait, each substitution affects the next. Let me think about each step.

Step 1: Introduce ethoxy group.

Benzene + ethoxy group (using, say, ethyl chloride with a Lewis acid catalyst? Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, but for ethoxy, which is an ether, maybe we use a nucleophilic substitution or something else. Wait, no, introducing an ether into benzene is via, for example, the Williamson ether synthesis, but wait, that's for making ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl halide with a catalyst. Oh, wait, I think that introducing an ethoxy group can be done via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that's more for making methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps via using ethyl chloride and a Lewis acid like AlCl3, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically introduces alkyl groups, but for O-alkylation, maybe it's different. Hmm, perhaps that's a wrong approach. Alternatively, introducing an ethoxy group can be done via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strongly activating groups, which benzene doesn't have. So perhaps a better approach is to do a nitration first, but that would deactivate the ring.

Wait, actually, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation. But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move on and maybe come back.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as the first substituent. So benzene is nitrated first? Wait, no, because nitro is deactivating, which would make Friedel-Crafts tough later.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group (activating, o/p-directing)

2. Introduce tert-butyl group (using Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups)

3. Introduce nitro group (deactivating, m-directing)

But wait, the nitro group is meta to ethoxy, which is position 1. So if I first introduce ethoxy (position 1), then tert-butyl (position 2, since ethoxy is o/p-directing), but then introducing nitro would be in position 3 (from ethoxy) or position 4 (from t-Bu). Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the directing effects.

Wait, let me think: after ethoxy and t-Bu are in positions 1 and 2, adding nitro would be directed by the most activating group present. Ethoxy is more activating than t-Bu (since t-Bu is a strong activating group, but maybe ethoxy is stronger? Or wait, t-Bu is a strong activating, o/p-directing group. So when both are present, which directs where the next substituent goes?

Wait, when multiple substituents are present, the most activating group directs the incoming substituent. So if ethoxy and t-Bu are both present, and both are activating, which one is more activating? I think that the activating effect of the ethoxy group (an ether) is stronger than that of the t-Bu group, which is an alkyl group. Wait, actually, the alkyl groups are stronger activating than the ether groups? Or the other way around?

Wait, no, the activating power: alkyl groups are stronger activating (since they are electron-donating via induction and hyperconjugation), while ethers are also activating but maybe less so than alkyl groups. Wait, I think the order is: -O-R (ether) is less activating than -R (alkyl). So alkyl groups are stronger activating, meaning they have a stronger effect on directing.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The activating groups are in order of strength: -O-R (like ethoxy) is activating, and -R (like t-Bu) is more activating. So when both are present, the most activating group (t-Bu) would direct the next substituent.

Wait, but in this case, the target has nitro at position 3. Let me try to imagine the substituents.

If we have ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, then adding nitro would be influenced by the t-Bu group (since it's more activating) which is at position 2. The t-Bu is o/p-directing. So the next substituent (nitro) would enter at position 3 (meta to t-Bu), but wait, position 3 is meta to ethoxy as well. Hmm, maybe that's where the nitro group ends up.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced earlier, but that would require activating the ring, which may not be possible if another substituent is deactivating.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the substituents in the target molecule. The nitro group is at position 3. Let's imagine that the nitro group is introduced after the other two substituents are in place.

So, the steps would be:

1. Introduce ethoxy group (position 1) → benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Next, introduce t-Bu group. Since ethoxy is activating and o/p-directing, t-Bu would be introduced at position 2 or 4. But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2. So after ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2.

3. Then introduce nitro group. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). The most activating group is t-Bu. So the next substituent (nitro) will be directed by t-Bu. t-Bu is o/p-directing. So possible positions for nitro are 1 (ortho to t-Bu), 3 (para).

But position 1 is already taken by ethoxy, so nitro would go to position 3. That matches the target.

So the order of substituents would be ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Alternatively, if the order is t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, let's think about that.

1. Introduce t-Bu → benzene → t-Bu-benzene (position 1).

2. Now introduce ethoxy. t-Bu is o/p-directing, so ethoxy could go into position 2 or 4.

But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, which is the same as t-Bu's position, which can't be. Wait, no, benzene is a ring. If t-Bu is at position 1, then ethoxy would be at position 2 or 4. Let's say position 2. Then, when introducing nitro, where would it go?

Hmm, but in the target, ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So perhaps the initial order is ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, but if we start with ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro, that's three substituents. Now, how do the reactions go.

Each step would require that the ring is activated for the next substitution.

Let me outline each step.

First step: introduce ethoxy group.

Reagents for that would be ethyl chloride and AlCl3? No, wait, AlCl3 is a Lewis acid catalyst used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but ethoxy is an ether, so how is it introduced?

Wait, Friedel-Crafts can't introduce ethers directly. Oh, wait, perhaps through the use of an electrophilic substitution where the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method. Alternatively, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activated ring, which benzene doesn't have. So maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nitration followed by some other steps. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via sulfonation, but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a leaving group is present. For example, if I form a nitration, then substitute the nitro group with ethoxy, but that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the nitro group. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making it harder to add more groups. So maybe that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: introduce t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy. But that seems unlikely because nitro is deactivating and would make adding ethoxy difficult.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last. So steps would be: ethoxy, t-Bu, nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy into benzene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we can use an Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. For example, benzene undergoes acylation to form acetophenone, then reduced to form ethylbenzene. But wait, that would give an ethyl group, not an ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but without a good leaving group, that's not possible. Maybe we need to form a good leaving group first.

Wait, perhaps we can use a nitration, then a substitution. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options provided and see which ones fit the order I'm considering.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of steps. Let me examine each.

Option A: The steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Introduces t-Bu group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation?

Wait, the options are a bit confusing with the numbering, but let me proceed.

Option A steps:

i: t-Bu introduced.

ii: nitration.

iii: SO3, which is sulfonation. Wait, but sulfonic acid groups are meta directors.

iv: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v: dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis?

vi: H3O+, H2O, heat → perhaps acid workup.

vii: NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group via SN2? Wait, perhaps it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but I'm not sure.

viii: Fe/HCl → maybe for a coupling reaction.

ix: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

This sequence is a bit confusing. Starting with t-Bu, then nitration, then sulfonation. Not sure if that leads to the desired product.

Option B:

i) t-Bu chloride/AlCl3 → t-Bu group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction of nitro group.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis, maybe to form a hydroxyl group.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps introducing ethoxy via SN2.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me see the order: t-Bu, nitro, Fe/HCl (possibly reduces nitro to amine?), then another nitration, which doesn't make sense. Maybe this is not the right path.

Option C:

i) t-Bu chloride/AlCl3 → t-Bu group.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro group.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy introduction.

So steps: t-Bu, sulfonate, nitrate, reduce, diazotize, nitrate again, hydrolyze, acid, ethoxy.

Not sure. Also, introducing SO3 group (sulfonic acid) would deactivate the ring, making further substitution difficult.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) t-Bu chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

So starting with nitration, then reduction, then t-Bu, then another nitration, etc. But starting with nitro group (deactivating) would make Friedel-Crafts difficult. So step iii in option D is Friedel-Crafts after a nitro group, which is deactivating. That's unlikely to work because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. So this option probably isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Let's consider the order of substituents again.

If I have to introduce nitro group as the last substituent, then the previous steps should have introduced the other groups. So nitro is added last, after ethoxy and t-Bu.

But how to introduce ethoxy?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a good leaving group is present, such as a nitro group. Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after nitration, but that would require the ring to be activated, which it isn't after nitration.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts typically uses acyl chlorides or alkyl halides. For alkoxy groups, perhaps it's different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on how to introduce the ethoxy group. Maybe I should focus on the options and see which one correctly places the substituents.

Let me try to think about each option's steps and how it would affect the molecule.

Option B:

i: t-Bu → so after step i, we have tert-butyl benzene.

ii: nitration. Nitration of t-Bu benzene: t-Bu is activating, so nitro would enter at ortho or para positions. Let's say position 4 (para) relative to t-Bu.

But the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy. Hmm, perhaps not the right path.

Wait, let me see. Alternatively, maybe after introducing t-Bu, then nitration occurs in a specific position.

Then, step iii: Fe/HCl → FeCl3 and HCl. FeCl3 is a catalyst for some reactions. Maybe it's used in a nitration, but in this case, step ii was nitration. So step iii: Fe/HCl. Wait, maybe it's a hydrolysis or reduction step.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced to an amine. So step iii: Fe/HCl (like conc. HCl and Fe) could be used to reduce nitro groups to amines. So after step ii, we have nitro group at position 4. Step iii: reduce to amine → so position 4 is an amine.

Then step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? That doesn't make sense because the ring is now deactivated by the amine? Wait, no, amines are strong activating groups, so nitration would be easier. But why would you add another nitro group?

Maybe this path isn't correct.

Option C:

i: t-Bu.

ii: sulfonation → introduces -SO3H group.

iii: nitration → where would nitro go? The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So nitration would occur meta to the sulfonic acid and any other substituents.

But if the ring has t-Bu and sulfonic acid, the directing would be tricky. And then introducing ethoxy after that would be difficult because of the deactivating groups.

Option A:

Steps: t-Bu, nitration, sulfonation, then diazotization, hydrolysis, ethoxy via NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, after nitration, the ring has t-Bu and nitro groups. Nitro is deactivating, making further substitution difficult. Then sulfonation would add another deactivating group, making it even harder to add ethoxy.

So perhaps option A isn't the right path.

Option D:

i: nitration → benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So we have phenylamine.

iii: t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → but phenylamine is a strong activating group, so t-Bu can be introduced at ortho or para positions.

iv: nitration again → nitro group would be directed by the t-Bu and amine groups. But the ring is now with amine and t-Bu. The amine is a stronger activating group, so nitro would go ortho or para to amine, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the sequence of substituents in the target and see which option correctly places them.

The target is 2-(t-Bu)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So substituents at 1,2,3.

Possibly, the nitro is introduced last.

So, steps to introduce ethoxy, t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis. For that, you need a good leaving group. Like, if you have a nitro group, you can substitute it with an ethoxy group under certain conditions.

But wait, nitro groups are meta-directing and deactivating, which makes substitution difficult, but perhaps under specific conditions, like using NaOH and EtBr (sodium ethoxide and ethyl bromide?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must have a strong activating group that directs and activates the ring in the position opposite to the leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group has been added. So, for example, nitro group is in position 3, then we substitute it with ethoxy. But nitro is a meta director, so how would that substitution work?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but on an aromatic ring, that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Mitsunobu reaction or some other method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but again, that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which options introduce the ethoxy group as the last step. Looking at the options:

Option A:

Step vii is NaOH/EtBr → perhaps introducing ethoxy via SN2.

So after steps i to vi, the ring has t-Bu, nitro, and other substituents. Then step vii introduces ethoxy.

Option B:

Step vii: NaOH/EtBr → introducing ethoxy.

Option C:

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy last.

Option D:

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy last.

So, the ethoxy is introduced in the last step in options A, B, C, D.

But how does that work if the ring has deactivating groups?

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the order is: introduce t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro. Let's see if that's possible.

But how to introduce ethoxy after t-Bu.

t-Bu is an activating group; so after t-Bu is introduced, we can introduce ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, maybe ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution using a nitro group as a leaving group, but again, that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group has been converted into a good leaving group, like a nitroso group or something else, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a chloride substitution. Wait, but without a chloride on the ring, that wouldn't be possible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions in the target molecule.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3, which are adjacent in the ring.

So, the order of substitution would be important.

Let me think about the nitration step.

Suppose I introduce the ethoxy group first. Then, when I add t-Bu, it goes to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). Then, the next step is nitration.

But nitro is a meta director. Wait, no, nitration is done using HNO3 and H2SO4, which is a nitration mixture. When the ring has activating groups, the incoming nitro group is directed by the most activating group.

So, after ethoxy and t-Bu are present, the most activating group is t-Bu. So nitro would be directed to the meta position relative to t-Bu, which would be position 3.

But ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2. The meta position to t-Bu would be positions 5 and maybe 3? Wait, benzene is a ring, so the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in order.

Wait, for t-Bu at position 2, the meta positions are 5 and 6. No, wait, that's not correct. The meta position is two carbons away in either direction.

Wait, for t-Bu at position 2, the meta positions would be 5 and 6? Or 3?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me try to visualize the benzene ring. Let's number the ring as follows:

Position 1 → ethoxy

Position 2 → t-Bu

Position 3 → nitro

So, the substituents are at 1,2,3.

Now, when nitro is introduced, which group is directing it?

At the time of nitration, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2).

The most activating group is t-Bu, which is strongly activating. So nitration will occur in the positions directed by t-Bu. t-Bu is o/p-directing. So the possible positions are ortho (1 and 3) and para (5) relative to t-Bu.

But position 1 is already occupied by ethoxy, so the nitro would go to position 3, which is para to t-Bu? Or ortho?

Wait, t-Bu is at position 2. Ortho positions are 1 and 3. So position 3 is available, so nitro would go there. Yes, that matches the target.

So the order of substitution is:

1. Ethoxy at position 1.

2. t-Bu at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Nitro at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu, but meta to ethoxy? Or ortho to t-Bu, which is more activating.)

So the steps are:

Introduce ethoxy → then t-Bu → then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an electrophilic substitution where a good electrophile is present.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation: introduces t-Bu at position 1.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration: t-Bu directs nitro to position 4 (para).

But our target has ethoxy at position 1, so this doesn't fit.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts: but the ring is now activated by amine, so t-Bu would go ortho or para to amine.

But we're aiming for ethoxy at position 1, which would conflict.

Hmm.

Option C:

i) t-Bu → position 1.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate group. Now the ring has t-Bu and sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Sulfonate is deactivating, so nitro would go meta to sulfonate, which is position 4 or 5, depending on where sulfonate is.

Not matching target.

Option A:

i) t-Bu → position 1.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 4.

iii) sulfonate → position 2?

Then steps for diazotization, hydrolysis to introduce OH, then ethoxy via NaOH/EtBr.

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the correct order is: introduce t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

But how.

Wait, after t-Bu and nitro are present, the ring has deactivating groups which make further substitution difficult. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is in place. So, the steps would be:

1. Introduce t-Bu.

2. Introduce nitro.

3. Substitute nitro with ethoxy.

But that requires the nitro group to be converted into a good leaving group, which I'm not sure how to do.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is replaced via a diazonium salt. For example, convert nitro to diazonium chloride, then substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think.

So steps would be:

1. Introduce t-Bu → benzene → t-Bu benzene.

2. Nitration → t-Bu benzene → nitro group added, say at position 4.

3. Diazotization → convert nitro group to diazonium chloride. Wait, no, nitro isn't directly converted to diazonium; that's for aryl amines.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The diazonium salt is formed from amines, not nitro groups.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce the nitro group, then the t-Bu, then substitute the nitro with ethoxy.

But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after nitro is present. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Looking at option B:

Steps:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro added para to t-Bu (position 4).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (position 4 becomes amine).

iv) nitrate again → but now the ring is activated by amine, so nitro would go ortho or para to amine. But where?

Wait, after step iii, the substituents are t-Bu at 1, amine at 4.

Now, step iv: nitrate again. So where would nitro go? The amine (now in position 4) is a strong activating group, so nitro would go ortho or para to it.

Ortho to position 4 would be positions 3 and 5. Para would be position 1, but that's where t-Bu is. So nitro would go to position 3 or 5.

Assuming it goes to position 3.

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine (position 4) to form diazonium chloride.

Step vi: H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis of diazonium chloride to form hydroxyl group at position 4.

Step vii: NaOH/EtBr → Williamson ether synthesis: ethoxy group introduced at position 4 via SN2, replacing the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1. So this doesn't match.

Hmm.

Option C:

Steps:

i) t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

I think this is getting too convoluted and not leading towards the correct positions.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces to amine.

iii) t-Bu → Friedel-Crafts. Since the ring is activated by amine, t-Bu would be introduced at ortho or para to amine (position 1). Let's say position 2.

iv) nitrate again → since the ring has t-Bu and amine, the most activating is amine, so nitro would go ortho or para. But we already have nitro at position 1; no, wait, step iv is another nitration. Maybe at position 4.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo the nitro? No, nitro is not directly converted to diazo. Only amines do that.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to introduce t-Bu first, then ethoxy via a Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation, then nitrate.

But I'm not sure how to introduce ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts. Maybe using an ethyl halide with AlCl3 as a catalyst.

If that's possible, then the steps would be:

i) t-Bu.

ii) ethoxy.

iii) nitro.

Looking at the options, option C has steps:

i) t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate. So that's not our desired ethoxy.

Option A: steps i and ii are t-Bu and nitration.

Hmm.

Another approach: the target has three substituents, so perhaps each substituent is introduced via a different reaction.

Let me think about the final substituent, the nitro group. Since it's meta to ethoxy, perhaps it was added after ethoxy.

So, the steps:

1. Introduce ethoxy.

2. Introduce t-Bu.

3. Introduce nitro.

But I'm stuck on how to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let me think again.

Option B steps:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro at position 4.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (position 4).

iv) nitrate → since the ring is activated by amine, nitro goes ortho or para to amine. Let's say position 2.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo at position 2.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydroxyl at position 2.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy group at position 2 via SN2.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, so this doesn't match.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the positions each substituent will take based on the order of reactions.

Let me think: the target has substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

So the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy (position 1) and ortho to t-Bu (position 2).

So, perhaps the nitro was directed by the t-Bu group, which is more activating than ethoxy.

Thus, the order would be ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via a substitution of a nitro group with a good nucleophile, but I'm not sure about the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation after t-Bu is present.

But I'm not confident about the exact steps.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option B is the correct one.

Option B:

i) t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 4.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine (position 4).

iv) nitrate again → nitro at 2.

v) diazo → position 2.

vi) hydrolysis → hydroxyl at 2.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy at 2.

But the target has ethoxy at 1, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has an activating group.

Wait, after introducing t-Bu and nitro, but that's deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced before the nitro.

Thus, the steps would be ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But without knowing how to introduce ethoxy, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the hydroxyl group is formed.

Looking back, in option B, step vii is introducing ethoxy at position 2, but the target requires ethoxy at position 1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Option C steps:

i) t-Bu.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) reduce nitro to amine.

v) diazo.

vi) nitrate again.

vii) hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first introduce the ethoxy group, then t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts, then nitrate.

But how to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after nitration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm not confident. After a lot of thinking, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the correct order of substituents is ethoxy, t-Bu, nitro.

So, the steps:

1. Introduce ethoxy → benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → ethoxy directs to ortho/para. Let's say position 2.

3. Introduce nitro: since the ring has ethoxy (activating) and t-Bu (activating), the more activating group (t-Bu) directs nitro to position 3 (ortho to t-Bu).

So, how to introduce ethoxy.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group has been converted to a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

a) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

b) Reduce nitro to amine → phenylamine.

c) Introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu would be directed by amine.

d) Nitrate again → directed by t-Bu.

But this is getting too tangled.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the reasoning that the nitro group is introduced last, directed by the t-Bu group, which is more activating.

So, looking for an option where the ethoxy and t-Bu are introduced before nitro.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B is the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, with the nitro group being meta to the ethoxy group and ortho to the tert-butyl group. The synthesis must consider the directing effects of the substituents and the reactivity of the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
   - Step ii introduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group (ortho/para-directing).
   - Step iii introduces the sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating and meta-directing, complicating further substitution.
   - Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and introduction of the ethoxy group. However, the sequence does not align with the desired positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii introduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group to the para position.
   - Step iii reduces the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl.
   - Step iv reintroduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the amine group (ortho/para-directing) to the ortho position relative to the amine.
   - Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and introduction of the ethoxy group. However, the sequence does not consistently align with the desired positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii introduces the sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating and meta-directing, making further substitution difficult.
   - Step iii introduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the sulfonic acid group to the meta position.
   - Subsequent steps involve reduction, diazotization, nitration, hydrolysis, and introduction of the ethoxy group. The sequence does not align with the desired positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i introduces the nitro group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs subsequent substitution to the meta position.
   - Step ii reduces the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl.
   - Step iii introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which would be directed by the amine group (ortho/para-directing).
   - Step iv reintroduces the nitro group, which would be directed by the tert-butyl group (ortho/para-directing).
   - Subsequent steps involve diazotization, sulfonation, hydrolysis, and introduction of the ethoxy group. The sequence does not align with the desired positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the nitro group to be meta to the ethoxy group and ortho to the tert-butyl group. After analyzing the options, **Option B** appears to be the most plausible sequence, as it introduces the tert-butyl and nitro groups in a manner consistent with their directing effects, and the final steps allow for the introduction of the ethoxy group. However, the sequence does not perfectly align with the desired positions, and the reasoning involves some uncertainty.

Answer: B
