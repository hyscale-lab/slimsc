Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes. So, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions, forming a complex. The Ca-EDTA complex would be something like [CaEDTA]^2-.

The problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric ratio means the molar ratio is 1:1. So for every mole of Ca^2+ ions, there's a mole of EDTA^4- (or its conjugate base) forming the complex.

The formation constant, Kf, represents the stability of the complex. The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but EDTA is a polydentate ligand, so each EDTA molecule can bind four pairs of electrons, but in this case, I think it's a 1:1 ratio.

So, the formation constant K is given as 5e10. That's a large value, which makes sense because EDTA forms very stable complexes.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote this as the concentration of [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

In solution, the complex dissociates to some extent into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So, the dissociation can be written as:

[CaEDTA]^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let the concentration of Ca^2+ be x. Then, because the complex dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x.

So, plugging into the formation constant equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) 

Which becomes:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) 

Wait, because [CaEDTA] is 0.02, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x.

So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x²)

I can rearrange this equation to solve for x².

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 / 5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 because 1e-2 /1e10 is 1e-12. So 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 is 4e-13.

Wait, no, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13, correct.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, but wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7 approximately.

So x is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this calculation.

Wait, did I make any miscalculations? Let me check the steps again.

1. Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

2. [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. So 0.02 = [complex] = 0.02.

3. Assuming x = [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-].

4. So 5e10 = 0.02/(x²) → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Correct.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2 * 3.16e-7 → 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of both \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
