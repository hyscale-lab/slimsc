Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember from my classes that when dealing with objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics. Instead, we need to apply special relativity principles.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, respectively. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. I think there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I should subtract their speeds. Let me plug in the values.

So, v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. Plugging into the formula:
v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²))
Simplify the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c
Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh, that's approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy. The total energy would be the sum of their energies.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me calculate each energy.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25
So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547
So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². So about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower than our calculation. So option C seems correct.

Wait, the options: Let me double-check the calculation. Oh wait, E1 is 2.5, E2 is 3.464. Sum is 5.964, which is approximately 5.96 when rounded. So option C's energy is correct, and their relative speed is about 0.14c. So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we apply principles of special relativity. The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and total energy \(E \approx 5.96mc^2\) match option C.
