Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh right, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and ΔE is the energy difference between the levels. Oh wait, and if the levels are the same for both stars, then g2/g1 should be the same for both. So maybe I can ignore the ratio of statistical weights since they’re the same for the same transition in both stars.

The problem states that the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. But wait, the question is about the temperatures T1 and T2. The key here is that the excitation level of star_1's iron is twice that of star_2's. So if n1 is the population in the excited state for star_2, then star_1's population would be 2*n1?

Wait, no, let me clarify. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for each atom, the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2? Or does it mean that the fraction of atoms in the excited state is twice as much?

I think it's the latter. So, the ratio of excited to ground state atoms (or whatever the other state is) is higher in star_1. So, for star_1, n2/n1 = 2*(n2')/n1', where the primes are for star_2. Wait, actually, the problem says that the excitation is twice as much. So perhaps n2 (excited) for star_1 is twice that of n2 (excited) for star_2, assuming that the ground state n1 is the same proportionally. Or maybe n2/n1 for star_1 is twice that of star_2's n2'/n1'.

So, let's think in terms of the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote T1 as the temperature of star_1 and T2 as that of star_2. The ratio of the excited states to the ground state is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, no. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), because for the Boltzmann equation, the higher energy level (n2) is less populated. So higher temperature would lead to higher n2/n1.

Wait, wait. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for a given ΔE, higher T makes the exponential less negative, so the ratio increases.

So, for star_1, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star_2, n2'/n1' = same (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that the excitation (n2) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n2/n1 = 2 * (n2'/n1').

Wait, no. Because the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio n2/n1 for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2. So:

n2/n1 = 2 * (n2'/n1').

But wait, no—because n2/n1 is the ratio of the excited to ground state. So if that ratio is larger, it means more excitation. So if star_1 has more excitation, then (n2/n1)_1 > (n2/n1)_2.

Given that, we can write:

(n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

But given the Boltzmann equation, (n2/n1)_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) * (g2/g1),

(n2/n1)_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) * (g2/g1).

Since g2/g1 is the same for both, we can write:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me write that equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Bring the terms together:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2).

Wait, wait. Let me rearrange: 

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2) 

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor this another way.

Let me rearrange the equation.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

=> ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

So, ΔE/(k) is a constant, given that ΔE is known. But wait, the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. Let me think about whether that's useful. Wait, but the answer options don't have any constants, so perhaps it's not needed.

Wait, the question is about the equation relating T1 and T2. So perhaps the ΔE and k will cancel out. Let me see.

Let me see: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

We can divide both sides by ΔE/(k) to get:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2) * (k) / ΔE.

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute k. The Boltzmann constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the value of k. So ΔE = k.

So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k. So, that's a key point. Because if ΔE = k, then ΔE/(k) = 1.

So substituting back into the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k) / ΔE.

But since ΔE = k, this becomes:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k) / (k) )= ln(2).

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Hmm, but looking at the options, let me see which equation matches this.

We can rearrange the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Multiply both sides by -1:

(1/T1 - 1/T2) = -ln(2).

But perhaps it's easier to think about:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2).

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, let's write the equation as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Let me rearrange terms:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but let me check that:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, because:

1/T2 = (T1)/(T1 T2),

1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2),

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, that's option D.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs.

Earlier, we had:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left:

(-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) )= ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )= ln(2)

Which, with ΔE=k, becomes:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) )= ln(2).

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Which is the same as:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

So yes, the equation is ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ).

Looking at the options, option D is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation governs the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels under LTE:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for both stars:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing these equations gives:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1}}{\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Substituting the ratio \(\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}\), we get:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of the Boltzmann constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly represent the relationship between \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) derived from the Boltzmann equation.
