Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which statement is correct among the options provided.

Wait, eigenvalues. I remember that for a matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0. But since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, maybe it's easier to compute directly.

First, let me write down the matrix S. The first row is [0, -i], and the second is [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0   -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Now, to find eigenvalues a, I set up the equation (Ay - a I)φ = 0. The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a       -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. So determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ].

Wait, determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) minus (element (1,2) * element (2,1) ) but since it's a 2x2 matrix, it's ad - bc. So:

det = a² - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ]

Compute that second term. i times -i is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So (i * (-i)) = -i² = 1.

So the term is (h²/(16π²)) * 1. So det = a² - h²/(16π²) = 0.

Solving this, a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Both are real numbers, so the eigenvalues are real. Wait, but the matrix Ay is Hermitian, right? Because S is Hermitian? Let me check.

The matrix S is [0 -i; i 0]. Its conjugate transpose would be [0 i; -i 0], which is same as S. So S is Hermitian. Then c·S would also be Hermitian since c is real. So Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real. Wait, so the options that mention imaginary parts must be incorrect. Let me check the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But since the eigenvalues are real, their imaginary parts should be zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. But same issue—eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts are zero. So B is wrong.

Options C and D. Let's think about them.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Well, A² would be (Ay)^2. Since Ay is a spin component, for spin-1/2 particles, the square of any component would be (h²/4π²)(S_x² + S_y² + S_z²) ? Wait, no, A is the operator, so A is the component. Wait, no, A here is the operator, and A² is the square of the operator. But for spin-1/2, the square of each component is (like S_y^2 would be (ħ/2)^2 times the identity matrix, since S_y^2 + S_x^2 + S_z^2 = (3/4) ħ² I for spin-1/2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, for any component, A^2 would have eigenvalues (a)^2, which are the squares of the eigenvalues of A. So if Ay has eigenvalues ±h/(4π), then A² has eigenvalues (h/(4π))^2 and same positive. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A², because A² is a multiple of identity? Wait, wait, no. Wait, A² would be (c S)^2 where S² is Sx² + Sy² + Sz²? Or wait, no, (c S)^2 would be c² S^2, where S^2 is the sum of squares. But S is the Pauli matrices scaled, perhaps.

Wait, for spin-1/2 systems, the square of each component operator (like Sx, Sy, Sz) is (ħ/2)^2 I. Because Sx^2 + Sy^2 + Sz^2 = (3/4) ħ^2 I. So each individual Sx^2 = (ħ/2)^2 I, same for Sy and Sz.

So A_y is c S, with c = h/(4π). So A_y^2 would be (c^2) S^2. S^2 is (ħ^2/4) I, because for spin-1/2, S² = (ħ/2)^2 I. Wait, but what's the unit here?

Wait, perhaps I should compute S^2. The matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute S squared.

S * S = [0*(-i) + (-i)*i , 0*i + (-i)*0 ] for first row? Wait, no, matrix multiplication is row by column.

So S^2 calculation:

Element (1,1) is (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.
Element (1,2) is (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0.
Element (2,1) is (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.
Element (2,2) is (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i^2 = 1.

So S^2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I, the identity matrix.

Wait that's interesting. So S^2 = I, which is 2x2 identity matrix. So then, A_y^2 is (c S)^2 = c² (S^2) = c² I.

So any eigenfunction of A_y would be an eigenfunction of A_y squared as well, with eigenvalue (c^2)(1). Because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenvectors of Ay, which for A² would be (c^2) times the eigenvalue squared. Wait, no. Let me think again.

If Ay has eigenvalue a, then A_y^2 would have eigenvalue a^2. But since A_y^2 is c² I, then A_y^2 acting on any vector (eigenfunction) would just multiply by c². So the eigenvalue of A_y^2 is c², regardless of the eigenvector. So all eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A_y^2, with eigenvalue c².

So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because Ay's eigenfunctions are eigenvectors of A_y^2. Wait, but A² is (Ay)^2? Or is A the total angular momentum? Wait, the question uses A as the Y-component operator. So A² would be the square of the Y-component. So in this case, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of Ay squared. So option C says that the eigenvectors of Ay can be eigenvectors of A² but not of Az. Hmm, but if the state is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az. So C could be correct.

But what about option D? It says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. I'm not sure what that means. Basis functions in what sense? The matrix is 2x2, so it's in a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions form a basis for that space. So any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combo of the eigenvectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. But maybe D is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So let's look back at the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Wait, the operator is Ay. So A^2 is (Ay)^2. As discussed, yes, the eigenfunctions are eigenvectors of A^2. But are they eigenfunctions of Az?

Az is the Z-component operator, which is another component of angular momentum. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of one component (say, Ay) are superpositions of the eigenstates of another component, like Az. So a state that's an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az. Therefore, C's statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, as the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors (which are two) form a basis for the space. So any vector can be written in terms of these eigenvectors. So D's statement is correct. Wait, but wait: The question is, which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct. Hmm, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, what's the question again: "During the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct?"

Let me re-express the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As A² is (Ay)^2, which is a scalar multiple of identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That makes sense because eigenfunctions of Ay are in a superposition of eigenstates of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, since Ay is 2x2 and the eigenvectors are two in number and orthogonal, they form a basis for the space. So D is correct as a statement. But wait, the eigenvectors are the basis functions, so D's statement is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one is correct? Let me think again.

Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix representation is in a certain basis. The eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis. So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. So D is correct.

Wait, but in the question, the matrix of Ay is given, so the basis is presumably the standard basis. The eigenfunctions may not necessarily be the same as the standard basis vectors. So the statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which perhaps means that the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. Which they do, because in a 2x2 space, two eigenvectors would form a basis.

But wait, for any square matrix, the eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but let me re-read option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, perhaps this is a confusing way of saying that the eigenvectors are the basis functions used to represent Ay. So if Ay is represented in the eigenbasis, then the eigenvectors are the basis. But the problem didn't specify which basis the matrix is given in. The matrix is given in the standard basis, perhaps. So if the eigenvectors are not the same as the standard basis, then the statement in D would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is suggesting that the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions (i.e., the standard basis). Which is not necessarily the case.

So if the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the standard basis, then option D would be incorrect.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

We know that A^2 is c^2 I, so any vector is an eigenvector of A^2 with eigenvalue c². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A^2. So the first part is correct.

As for whether they are eigenfunctions of Az: since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenvectors are different. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the second part is correct.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. If the operator is represented in its own eigenbasis, then yes. But the matrix given is not in the eigenbasis. Because the standard basis vectors are not the eigenvectors of Ay. So the matrix given is in the standard basis, so the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis vectors. Thus, D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct statement is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator \( A_y \), which is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the given 2×2 matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is Hermitian because \( S \) is Hermitian, and \( c \) is real. This ensures that the eigenvalues are real.
   - The eigenvalues are found by solving \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the characteristic equation becomes:
     \[
     a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
     \]
     Solving this gives the eigenvalues:
     \[
     a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]

2. **Imaginary Parts of Eigenvalues:**
   - Since \( A_y \) is Hermitian, its eigenvalues are real. Therefore, the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero. This makes **Option A** and **Option B** incorrect.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A_y^2 = c^2 I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This means any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A_y^2 \) with eigenvalue \( c^2 \).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. Thus, the first part of **Option C** is correct, and the second part is also valid.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2×2 space. However, the statement in **Option D** is ambiguous. While the eigenfunctions are indeed a basis for the space, the matrix \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the same as the standard basis vectors. Therefore, **Option D** is not necessarily correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A_y^2 \), and \( A_z \).
