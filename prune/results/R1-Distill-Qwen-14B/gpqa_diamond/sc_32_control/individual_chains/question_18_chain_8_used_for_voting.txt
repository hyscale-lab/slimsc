--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem here about two stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. I don't know if the mass matters here, but maybe it's a red herring because the question is about elemental abundances. Wait, but maybe the masses relate to their lifespans or something, but the question specifically talks about photospheric composition, so maybe it's not directly relevant. Let's focus on the given data.

The abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, the brackets here denote logarithmic abundance ratios. So, for example, [Fe/H] = 0 means that the star's iron abundance is the same as the Sun's.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. Oh, wait, 12 + log(...) equals a certain value. So, for example, for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So I can subtract 12 from both sides: log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Then, nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5. 

Wait, but that's the Sun's values. So for Star_1 and Star_2, the [Fe/H] is 0, which I think means that their Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Star_2's Mg abundance is same as Sun's.

Wait, let me get this straight. The [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or is it log10(nX/nY) = [X/Y] + log10(nX/nY)_sun? Wait, no, the general formula is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, that means log(nFe/nH) equals the solar value. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, but the Sun’s [Fe/H] is zero by definition, right? So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, implying that Fe abundance relative to H is same as Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0, so same as Sun.

But what about [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3. So for Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than the Sun's by a factor of 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So for Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3, meaning the ratio of Mg to Si is higher than the Sun's by 10^0.3.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the signs. Because [X/Y] is usually defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, then X is more abundant than Y relative to the sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3, so log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun + 0.3.

Wait, but what about the other elements? I think we'll need to express the ratios in terms of H for the stars, using the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], and then find the silicon ratio.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, nSi_1 / nSi_2.

So, I need to find nSi_1 and nSi_2, then take their ratio.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H] = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun).

From the Sun's data: log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe1/nH1 = 10^(-4.5) = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

What's the Sun's nSi/nFe? Let's calculate that.

From the Sun's data:

nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → nFe = 10^(-4.5) * nH.

nMg/nH = 10^(-5) → nMg = 10^-5 * nH.

But wait, what about Si? The question doesn’t give the solar [Si/Fe]. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find it.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. So I might need to calculate it based on the given data.

Wait, I have to think. Oh, wait, perhaps I can find nSi_sun using the data. Wait, no, I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun. Or do I?

Wait, wait. Wait, maybe because for the Sun, [Fe/H] is zero, but perhaps the [X/H] ratios for other elements are known? Wait, but the problem only gives for the Sun nFe and nMg as functions of H. So I don't have nSi_sun/nH_sun.

Hmm, that complicates things. So, without knowing the solar [Si/Fe] ratio, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of H. Let's see.

For Star_1:

nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Because [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun), which implies nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But I know nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 → nSi1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 )

Simplify:

nSi1 = 10^(0.3) * nSi_sun /nH_sun *nH1.

Wait, because nFe_sun cancels with 1/nFe_sun.

Wait, nFe_sun / nH_sun is a constant, so nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

So, substituting into nSi1:

nSi1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * nFe1.

Which is 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

The nFe_sun cancels, so nSi1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But wait, what is nSi_sun /nH_sun? That's the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio.

Hmm, but the problem only gives us nFe and nMg in the sun. So perhaps I need to find nSi_sun in terms of nFe_sun and nMg_sun? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si to H in the Sun using the given data. Hmm, but I don't have the exact value. So maybe I need to express everything in terms of H.

Wait, another approach: maybe for the Sun, I can calculate [Si/Fe]_sun, but I don't have the data. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the problem in terms of H, and let the H terms cancel out when taking the ratio of nSi1 and nSi2.

Wait, let me think about Star_1.

nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1 → equation (1).

nSi1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * nFe1 → equation (2).

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2):

nSi1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1 ) → simplifies to nSi1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2: [Mg/H] = 0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

We can rearrange this to find nSi2:

nSi2 = (nMg2) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )

nMg2 is (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

So substituting:

nSi2 = ( (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 ) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun * nH2) * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun) ) / 10^0.3

The nMg_sun cancels:

nSi2 = (1/nH_sun * nH2 * nSi_sun ) / 10^0.3.

Which is:

nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH2 / 10^0.3 ).

Now, the ratio nSi1 /nSi2 is:

[10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH1 ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * (nH2 /10^0.3 ) ) ]

Simplify this:

The (nSi_sun/nH_sun) terms cancel. So numerator: 10^0.3 *nH1.

Denominator: (nH2 /10^0.3) → which is (nH2) * 10^-0.3.

So ratio = [10^0.3 * nH1 ] / [ nH2 * 10^-0.3 ].

10^0.3 * 10^0.3 = 10^(0.6).

So ratio = 10^0.6 * (nH1 /nH2).

Wait, but what is nH1 and nH2?

Hmm, the problem doesn't give any information about the stars' hydrogen content. Oh, but wait, the stars' masses are given, but how does that relate to the number of atoms in the photosphere?

Wait, no, wait. The photosphere's composition is given in terms of number densities. But the stars' masses relate to their overall mass, not necessarily the number of atoms unless we consider the same size. But without information about the radius or surface area, I don't think we can relate the number of atoms to the star's mass. So perhaps the hydrogen number density ratio is 1? No, that can't be right because the stars are more massive but I don't think we have enough info.

Wait, perhaps the ratio nH1 / nH2 isn't needed because the problem is only looking for the ratio of silicon atoms, which is nSi1/nSi2, and if the ratio involves nH1 and nH2, but since we don't know the relation between them, perhaps there's something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogen abundance is the same, but why would that be? Because [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, which implies that [H/Fe] is 0 as well. Wait, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → so nFe/nH is same as sun. So, Star_1 has same Fe/H as the Sun, but what about H itself?

Wait, perhaps Star_1's H abundance is the same as Sun's? Because [Fe/H] is zero. So, if the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, and Star_1 has [Fe/H] zero, then their Fe and H are in the same ratio. But the total amount of H could be different because the star is more massive. But in terms of number density (nH), perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms per unit volume is different.

Wait, but the problem is about the photospheric composition. I'm not sure. Maybe the problem assumes that the number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars, but that doesn't make physical sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star's photosphere, and we can find the ratio of those ratios.

Wait, let me think again. From Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Because earlier, nSi1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

So, nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2:

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) /10^0.3.

Because from earlier, nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH2 / 10^0.3 ).

So, nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) /10^0.3.

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun)] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun) / 10^0.3 ] 

Simplify: (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) ) = 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98.

So, (nSi1/nH1) is about 3.98 times (nSi2/nH2).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which is nSi1/nSi2.

Hmm, but that would be (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2) ) → (nSi1/nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) * (nH1/nH2).

But I don't know nH1/nH2. How can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same overall number of hydrogen atoms, but that doesn't make sense because their masses are different. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen abundance is the same, but in reality, more massive stars have more hydrogen, but without knowing their radii, I can't compute their volumes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the hydrogen ratio and take nH1 = nH2, but that's probably not correct. But if I do that, then nSi1/nSi2 equals 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98, which is option A.

But wait, looking back at the problem, the options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So, 3.98 would round to ~4.0, which is close to option A (3.9).

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back. The problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, nSi_1 / nSi_2.

From earlier:

nSi1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH2) /10^0.3.

So, nSi1/nSi2 = [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH1 ] / [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 /10^0.3 ].

The (nSi_sun /nH_sun) terms cancel, so:

nSi1/nSi2 = [10^0.3 *nH1 ] / [ nH2 /10^0.3 ] → 10^0.3 *10^0.3 * (nH1 /nH2) ) = 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2).

But without knowing how nH1 and nH2 relate, I can't compute this ratio. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same for both stars, which would mean nH1 =nH2, making the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Alternatively, perhaps the stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms, which would be the case if they have the same radius and similar density, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the ratio of nH is 1, so nH1/nH2 =1.

If that's the case, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98 → approximately 3.9, which is option A.

But wait, another angle: perhaps I can find the ratio nH1/nH2 from the given data.

Wait, the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But without knowing the sun's [Mg/Fe], I can't relate nMg_sun and nFe_sun.

Wait, the sun's data: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Thus, for the Sun, nMg/nFe = (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.316. So [Mg/Fe]_sun = log(0.316) ≈ -0.5.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but for star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

So, log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm. So maybe another approach.

Wait, maybe I can express nSi in terms of nMg and then relate it in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of [Si/Fe] in each star and then relate their [Si/H] ratios.

Wait, let's think about each star's [Si/H].

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = nFe_sun * nH1 /nH_sun.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But to find nSi1/nH1, we can write:

nSi1/nH1 = (nSi1/nFe1) * (nFe1/nH1).

Which is 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) → 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Which would be log(10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun)) ) → log(10^0.3) → 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2) - log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 =nMg_sun * nH2/nH_sun.

Then, [Mg/Si]_2 is log( (nMg_sun *nH2/nH_sun) /nSi2 ) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

Let me write that:

log( (nMg_sun *nH2/(nH_sun *nSi2)) ) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Subtract the right side:

log( (nMg_sun *nH2/(nH_sun *nSi2)) ) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

Which is log( [ (nMg_sun *nH2/(nH_sun *nSi2)) ] / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )=0.3.

Simplify inside the log:

( nH2/(nH_sun *nSi2) * nSi_sun ) → (nH2 *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *nSi2 ).

So,

log( (nH2 *nSi_sun)/(nH_sun *nSi2 )) ) =0.3.

Exponentiating both sides:

(nH2 *nSi_sun)/(nH_sun *nSi2 ) =10^0.3.

Rearranging for nSi2:

nSi2 = (nH2 *nSi_sun) / (nH_sun *10^0.3 ).

So,

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) /10^0.3.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Which would be log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun) /10^0.3 / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ) → log(1/(10^0.3)) ) → -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Thus, for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H] is -0.3.

So, the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is (0.3) - (-0.3) ) in log space, but wait, no—because [X/H] is log(nX/nH). So, the actual ratio of nSi1/nH1 to nSi2/nH2 is 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) ) → 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) )=10^0.6≈3.98.

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) is ~3.98.

But the question is the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2, which is (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2) ) → [ (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2).

But without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't compute this. So, unless I assume that nH1/nH2 =1, which I don't think is valid.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only asking for the ratio of silicon atoms relative to hydrogen in each star, and their ratio is (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2)=10^0.6≈3.98, which would make the answer A) ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the number of hydrogen atoms is the same, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is only about the relative abundance of Si in each star's atmosphere, not the absolute number. So, the ratio would be (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2)=10^{0.6}≈3.98, which is ~4. So, the answer is A.

But why does the star's mass matter here? Oh, the masses are given, but I didn't use them in the calculations. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mass affects the number of atoms, but without knowing the radius, I can't find the number density. So, perhaps the problem is only about abundance ratios, not the total number of atoms.

So, perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2)=10^0.6≈3.98, so the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe1}}/n_{\text{H1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), meaning \( n_{\text{Fe1}}/n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{Fe1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg2}}/n_{\text{H2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), meaning \( n_{\text{Mg2}}/n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg2}}/n_{\text{Si2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
  \[
  \log(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{Fe1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) + 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe1}}/n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}})
  \]
  Thus, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
  \[
  \log(n_{\text{Mg2}}/n_{\text{Si2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) + 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg2}}/n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}} = (n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}}) / 10^{0.3}
  \]
  Thus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}}) \cdot n_{\text{H1}}}{(n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}}) \cdot n_{\text{H2}}}
\]
Assuming \( n_{\text{H1}}/n_{\text{H2}} = 1 \) (since the problem does not provide information about hydrogen abundance differences), this simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}/n_{\text{H2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
