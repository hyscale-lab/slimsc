Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature rather than mass. So maybe the mass part is a red herring, or perhaps it's used for something else, but I'm not sure yet.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because the constant b is the same for both. That makes sense. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars' radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. Oh, right! Radial velocity would cause a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength from Star_2 is Doppler shifted because it's moving towards or away from us. Wait, radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. So if Star_1 has radial velocity 0, its wavelength isn't shifted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s—I think that's the velocity towards us, but the sign depends on whether it's blueshifted or redshifted. But since the problem says they have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest, I need to consider this Doppler effect.

Wait, no. The problem says that the wavelengths they appear brightest are the same. But that might not be the same as their actual peak emission wavelengths. Oh, right, because of the Doppler effect, the observed peak wavelength λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ) or something like that. Wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), but that's a linear approximation. But for larger velocities, the relativistic formula would be better. Oh, but wait, the stars' velocities are 700 km/s. Let me think: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 700 is about 0.233c. Hmm, that's a significant fraction, so relativistic effects might matter. So the Doppler shift can't be approximated linearly.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_peak for both stars is the same. Let me denote λ1_obs and λ2_obs. Both are equal.

But the actual emitted λ_peak (λ1_emit and λ2_emit) would differ because of their velocities. So Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s, probably towards us (so blueshifted, making the observed λ shorter than emitted). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think about Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, the emitted light is blueshifted, so observed λ is shorter than emitted. The formula for relativistic Doppler shift is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Let me get the formula right.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving towards the observer (v is positive towards us) is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v / c. So if the star is moving towards us, beta is positive, and the observed λ is shorter (blueshifted) than emitted. If moving away, beta is negative, so the denominator becomes bigger, making λ_obs longer (redshifted).

So in this problem, Star_1 has v_r=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. But wait, is that towards us or away? The question just says radial velocities are 0 and 700. Radial velocity is positive if moving away, I think. Or maybe the sign depends on the convention. Oh, right, the radial velocity is usually positive when moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away, then v_r is positive 700 km/s. So its observed λ would be longer than emitted. But the problem says that the observed λ's are the same for both stars. So let me write the equations.

Let me denote:

λ1_obs = λ1_emit

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta = v_r2 / c. But wait, Star_2 is moving away, so v_r is positive (700 km/s), so beta is positive, which would make the observed wavelength longer than emitted.

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) )

But λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2, from Wien's law. Since b is the same for both, we can write:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Simplify: T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, let me double-check the algebra:

Divide both sides by (b / T2):

( (b/T1) ) / (b/T2) ) = sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) )

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) )

Wait, no: (b/T1) = (b/T2) * sqrt(...), so dividing both sides by (b/T2) gives (T2 / T1) = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Because T2 is the temperature of Star_2 and T1 is that of Star_1.

Alternatively, since beta is positive (v_r is 700 km/s, moving away), so (1 - beta) is less than (1 + beta), so the square root is less than 1. So T2 is less than T1.

Wait, but we can compute beta as v_r2 / c. Let's compute beta numerically.

v_r2 = 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So beta = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.002333...

So beta ≈ 0.002333.

Compute (1 - beta)/(1 + beta):

1 - beta ≈ 0.997667

1 + beta ≈ 1.002333

So (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ (1 - x)/(1 + x) where x is 0.002333.

Approximately, for small x, (1-x)/(1+x) ≈ (1 - 2x), but perhaps better to compute exactly.

But let's compute 0.997667 / 1.002333.

Let me calculate 0.997667 / 1.002333.

Let me compute this division:

Approximately, 0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ (1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ (1 - 2*0.002333) when x is small, but let's actually compute it numerically.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to make them manageable: 997667 / 1002333.

Let me compute 997667 ÷ 1002333.

Approximate as (1000000 - 2333) / (1000000 + 2333) = (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1 - 2*(0.002333) = 1 - 0.004666 = 0.995334. But that's an approximation. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach.

0.997667 / 1.002333.

Let me compute 1.002333 × 0.995 = ?

1.002333 × 0.995 = 1.002333 × (1 - 0.005) = 1.002333 - 0.005011665 = 0.9973213.

Which is less than 0.997667. Let's see 0.9953.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio:

(1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) = approx (1 - 2*0.002333) because for small x, (1-x)/(1+x) ≈ 1 - 2x. So that would be approximately 1 - 0.004666 = 0.995334.

But let me compute it more accurately:

(1 - beta) = 1 - 0.00233333333 = 0.9976666667.

(1 + beta) = 1 + 0.00233333333 = 1.0023333333.

So 0.9976666667 / 1.0023333333 = ?

Let me compute this division.

Let me denote A = 0.9976666667, B = 1.0023333333.

Compute A/B:

A = 0.9976666667 = 997666.6667e-6

B = 1.0023333333 = 1002333.3333e-6

So the ratio is approximately 997666.6667 / 1002333.3333.

Compute 997666.6667 / 1002333.3333 ≈ 0.99533.

Wait, let me compute 1002333.3333 × 0.99533.

Approximately, 1002333.3333 × 0.995 = 1002333.3333 × (1 - 0.005) = 1002333.3333 - (1002333.3333 × 0.005) = 1002333.3333 - 5011.6666665 ≈ 997321.6666.

But our numerator is 997666.6667, which is about 997321.6666 + 345. So the difference is 345. So the exact value would be a bit higher than 0.995.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator-like approach:

Compute 1002333.3333 × 0.99533 = ?

Well, perhaps it's better to use actual division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach here.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's just take the approximate value of the ratio as 0.99533.

So sqrt(0.99533) is approximately sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

Because sqrt(1) is 1, sqrt(0.9925) is about 0.9962, so 0.99533 is a bit less. Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.99533).

Let me compute 0.99766^2 = ?

0.99766 * 0.99766:

= (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 0.99532 - 0.0000054756 ≈ 0.9953145244.

Which is a bit less than 0.99533. So perhaps the square root is about 0.99766 + a tiny bit.

Wait, maybe the exact value isn't necessary because the problem gives the options in approximate factors, but perhaps I can proceed with the approximation.

So T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) ) ≈ sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So T2 is about 0.99766 * T1.

Now, the problem asks about luminosity. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since they radiate as black bodies, this applies.

We need the ratio L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 is higher than T2 (since T2 ≈ 0.99766 T1).

So let's compute L1/L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → (R1/R2) = 1.5.

So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1 / T2 = 1 / (T2/T1) ) = 1 / 0.99766 ≈ 1.00235.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.00235)^4.

Compute 1.00235^4.

We can use the approximation for small x: (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x^2 + ... .

x = 0.00235.

So (1.00235)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.00235) + (4*3/2)*(0.00235)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.00235)^3 + ... 

Compute each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: 4 * 0.00235 = 0.0094.

Third term: (12/2) * (0.00235)^2 = 6 * (0.0000055225) = 0.000033135.

Fourth term: (24/6) * (0.00235)^3 ≈ 4 * (0.00000001297) ≈ 0.00000005188.

Fifth term: (40/24) * (0.00235)^4 ≈ 1.6667 * 3.25e-10 ≈ 5.38e-10, which is negligible.

So summing up:

1 + 0.0094 = 1.0094.

Plus 0.000033135 → 1.009433135.

Plus 0.00000005188 → 1.009433187.

So approximately 1.00943.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00943.

So the overall ratio L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00943 ≈ 2.270.

Hmm, looking at the options, the choices are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Wait, but wait a second—did I make a mistake? Because earlier I thought that T2 is 0.99766 T1, so T1/T2 is approximately 1.00235. But if Star_2's temperature is lower, then T1 is higher, which would make (T1/T2)^4 a bit larger than 1, which would make L1 larger than L2, which is what the problem states. So this approach gives me L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00943 ≈ 2.270.

But none of the options is exactly 2.27. The closest option is B) ~2.32, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me recompute the Doppler shift part.

Given that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away from us, so v_r = +700 km/s.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) )

Wait, wait, I think I may have mixed up the formula earlier. Let me double-check the Doppler shift formula.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c. Because when the source moves away, the wavelength is redshifted, so λ_obs > λ_emit.

Wait, but earlier I had the inverse.

Wait, the formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ). Because if beta is positive (v away), then the denominator is smaller, so the ratio is larger, leading to a longer wavelength.

Wait, let me confirm. The Doppler formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + (v_r/c)) / (1 - (v_r/c)) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up mentally.

The general Doppler shift formula is:

f_obs = f_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) when the source is moving away (beta positive).

Because when the source moves away, the observed frequency is lower, so f_obs < f_emit. Since λ = c/f, so λ_obs = λ_emit * (f_emit / f_obs) ) = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Ah, okay, so I think I had the formula inverted earlier. So the correct formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Where beta is v_r / c, and v_r is positive when moving away.

So for Star_2, which is moving away at v_r = 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

And Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

The problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But from Wien's law, λ = b / T, so:

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

Substituting,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Divide both sides by (b / T2):

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which implies that:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that can't be right because if Star_2 is moving away (so redshifted), then its emitted wavelength is longer, implying a lower temperature. So T2 would be lower than T1. Let me compute the ratio correctly.

Wait, let me compute it again.

We have:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that suggests that T2 is larger than T1, which contradicts what I thought earlier. So maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, no. Let me think.

If Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Star_1's observed λ is λ1_emit.

Since the observed λ's are the same:

λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But λ1_emit = b / T1.

λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Divide both sides by (b / T2):

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But wait, beta is positive (700 km/s away). So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) is (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.004667.

So sqrt(1.004667) ≈ 1.00233.

Thus, T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

Hmm, that suggests that T2 is higher than T1. But that can't be right because Star_2 is moving away, so its emitted wavelength is longer (lower temperature?) Wait, wait, no. Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So the observed λ is longer, which would imply that the emitted λ is shorter. Because λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + beta) (non-relativistic approximation), so if λ_obs is longer, then λ_emit is shorter. Shorter λ corresponds to higher temperature. So that would imply that T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), but our problem says that the observed λ of both stars is the same. So Star_1 emits at λ1, and Star_2 emits at λ2. But due to moving away, Star_2's observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, and λ1_emit = λ1, then:

λ1 = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But λ1 = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2.

Thus,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Divide both sides by (b / T2):

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

With beta = 700/3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

Compute (1 + beta) = 1.002333, (1 - beta) = 0.997667.

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.004667.

So sqrt(1.004667) ≈ 1.00233.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of about 1.00233.

So T2 = approximately 1.00233 T1.

Wait, so Star_2 is hotter than Star_1? That's surprising because Star_1 is more massive and larger. But perhaps it's correct given the Doppler shift.

Now, moving on to luminosity.

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Since R1 = 1.5 R2, R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.00233 ≈ 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Compute 0.99768^4.

Again, using the approximation (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - n x + (n(n-1)/2)x² - ... for small x.

Here, x = 0.00232 (since 1 - 0.99768 = 0.00232).

n=4.

Compute 0.99768^4 = (1 - 0.00232)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.00232 + 6*(0.00232)^2 - 4*(0.00232)^3 + (0.00232)^4.

Compute each term:

1st term: 1.

2nd term: 4 * 0.00232 = 0.00928.

3rd term: 6*(0.00232)^2 =6*(0.0000053824)= 0.000032294.

4th term: -4*(0.00232)^3 = -4*(0.00000001248)= -0.00000004992.

5th term: (0.00232)^4 ≈ 2.96e-11, negligible.

So summing:

1 - 0.00928 = 0.99072.

Plus 0.000032294 → 0.990752.

Minus 0.00000004992 → approximately 0.990752.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99075:

2 * 0.99075 = 1.9815.

0.25 * 0.99075 = 0.2476875.

Total = 1.9815 + 0.2476875 = 2.2291875.

Approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23.

But wait, earlier when I thought T2 was lower, I got about 2.27. Now, after correcting the Doppler formula, I have L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought the problem said that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. But according to this, L1/L2 is about 2.23, which is greater than 1, so yes, L1 is larger. So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Star_1 and Star_2 have same observed λ_peak.

2. Star_1 has v_r=0 → λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

3. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s away → λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

4. So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

5. Using Wien's law: λ = b / T → T = b / λ.

6. So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

7. Compute beta = 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 700/3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333... Wait, wait, wait, no! Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So beta = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait, wait, wait! Earlier I made a mistake in calculating beta. Because 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. So beta = 700,000 / 3e8 = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.002333333. So beta ≈ 0.002333333, not 0.0233333. Oh! So that changes everything.

Ah, I see. I think I confused km/s with m/s earlier. So beta is 0.002333333, not 0.0233333. That's a crucial mistake.

So recalculating everything with beta = 0.002333333.

Now, compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) with beta = 0.002333333.

(1 + 0.002333333) = 1.002333333.

(1 - 0.002333333) = 0.997666667.

So (1.002333333)/(0.997666667) = approximately 1.004666667.

So sqrt(1.004666667) ≈ 1.00233.

So T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So T1 = T2 / 1.00233 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 ≈ 0.99768 T2.

So when computing L1/L2, which is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Compute (0.99768)^4.

Again, using the expansion (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² - 4x³ +x⁴, where x = 0.00232.

x=0.00232:

1st term: 1.

2nd term: -4*0.00232 = -0.00928.

3rd term: +6*(0.00232)^2 =6*(0.0000053824) = 0.0000322944.

4th term: -4*(0.00232)^3 = -4*(0.0000000125)= -0.00000005.

5th term: + (0.00232)^4 ≈ 2.96e-11, negligible.

So adding:

1 -0.00928 = 0.99072.

+0.0000322944 → 0.9907522944.

-0.00000005 → 0.9907522444.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907522444.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907522444 ≈ 2.22918.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought beta was 0.02333, I got a different result, but that was due to a miscalculation. Now, after correcting beta to 0.002333, the correct L1/L2 is about 2.23, which is option D.

Astronomers are analyzing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times greater. The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s (moving away), while Star_1 has no radial velocity. The goal is to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, assuming the stars radiate as black bodies.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Doppler Shift**:
   - The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{peak}} = \frac{b}{T}
     \]
     where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant and \(T\) is the temperature.
   - The observed wavelength of Star_2 is Doppler-shifted due to its radial velocity. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
     \]
     where \(\beta = v_r / c\) and \(v_r\) is the radial velocity.

2. **Equating Observed Wavelengths**:
   - Since the observed wavelengths of both stars are the same:
     \[
     \lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\), we find:
     \[
     \frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
     \]

3. **Calculating \(\beta\)**:
   - The radial velocity of Star_2 is \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 700,000 \, \text{m/s}\).  
     The speed of light is \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), so:
     \[
     \beta = \frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700,000}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.002333
     \]

4. **Temperature Ratio**:
   - Substituting \(\beta = 0.002333\) into the temperature ratio:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}}
     \]
   - Compute the ratio:
     \[
     \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.004667
     \]
   - Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx \sqrt{1.004667} \approx 1.00233
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     T_2 \approx 1.00233 \, T_1
     \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
   - The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
   - Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2\) and \(T_2 = 1.00233 \, T_1\):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{1.00233 \, T_1}\right)^4
     \]
   - Compute \((1.5)^2 = 2.25\).  
     Compute \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99768\).  
     Raise this to the fourth power:
     \[
     (0.99768)^4 \approx 0.99075
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99075 \approx 2.229
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.  
     The closest option is **D) ~2.23**.
