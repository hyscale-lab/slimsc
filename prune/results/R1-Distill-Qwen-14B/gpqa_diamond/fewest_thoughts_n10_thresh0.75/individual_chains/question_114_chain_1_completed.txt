Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me look at the reactions given.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. And I have to choose between options A to D for reagents A and B.

Wait, okay, so let's break down each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile reagent... Oh, wait, NaCN is sodium cyanide. I think this is a type of nucleophilic addition reaction. In ketones, the carbonyl group is attacked by a nucleophile. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think that usually, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but in the presence of an acid, maybe? Or maybe it's about the workup. Wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN- under acidic conditions? So the mechanism would be: the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. The product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That makes sense because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group.

Wait, so for the formation of cyanohydrin, the typical reagent is NaCN in acidic conditions. Like I think it's usually H3O+ (like H2SO4 or HCl) as the acid. So A would be a source of H+ and CN-.

Looking at the options, the first reactions' reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Option A has A as H3O+, which would make sense because that's the acid needed for the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, so the molecule has a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that's also bearing an OH group. The reaction is with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the CN group is being converted to a COOH group.

Wait, how does a nitrile get converted to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires strong acidic conditions, maybe with heat.

Wait, but what's the classic reagent for that? I think it's H3O+ (like H2SO4) and heat, or perhaps using something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with HCl (HCl as the acid) and then maybe H2O as the workup. Wait, but in this case, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: nitrile to carboxylic acid can be done through either acid or base hydrolysis. In the presence of H2O and acid, it would hydrolyze. Wait, but I need to think about whether it's a two-step process. Oh wait, no, maybe in the first step, the nitrile is converted to an amide, and then further to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the given reaction, the cyanohydrin (which has an OH and CN on the same carbon) is being transformed. So after adding the cyanide to the ketone, when you have the cyanohydrin, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but the second reaction is taking a more substituted cyanohydrin and converting the CN to COOH.

So how does that happen? Wait, the first step is adding CN- to the ketone to form a cyanohydrin. Then, in the second step, the nitrile group is being oxidized or hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the second reaction is taking 2-hydroxybutanenitrile (I think) and converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So, the CN becomes COOH. That's a hydrolysis reaction. So the conditions would have to be acidic or basic.

Wait, but the reagent is B, which is H2O. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps the reaction uses an acid catalyst. Because when you hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you typically need strong acidic conditions, like H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid) or HCl.

So looking at the options for B, the choices are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid) for B. Oh wait, in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is either HCl or acetic acid. Wait, but the reaction's B is H2O, but perhaps in the options, B is the reagent. Wait, no, the problem says:

"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ... "

Hmm, maybe I misread. So in the second reaction, the reagent is B, but the conditions are H2O. Or perhaps B is a catalyst. Wait, maybe it's a two-step process. Let me think again.

Wait, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. The second is the product of the first reaction (2-hydroxybutanenitrile) plus B (H2O) → butanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis where the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction conditions would be acidic or basic.

Wait, for nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical conditions are strong acid with H2O and heat. Alternatively, using a strong base like NaOH and then acidifying.

But in the problem, the reagent in the second reaction is B, which is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for the second reaction, B is the reagent in addition to H2O. So perhaps B is an acid or a base.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. So the reagent B would be an acid, perhaps HCl or H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options, for B, the options are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). So which one is the correct acid?

I remember that nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids is often done under strong acidic conditions. HCl is a strong acid, while acetic acid is weak. So perhaps HCl is required.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Maybe the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as reagent A. Because I'm a bit confused about the first step.

Wait, the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → cyanohydrin. So what's the role of A here?

NaCN provides the cyanide ion. The reaction is acid-catalyzed. So the A reagent would be an acid, which donates H+ to the carbonyl oxygen. So H3O+ would provide H+.

In the options, for A, options A and B have H3O+, C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm, but wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What's that for? Oh, wait, that's used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, maybe in other reactions.

Wait, perhaps in the first reaction, the reagent is not H3O+ but something else. Wait, but the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism requires the carbonyl to be protonated, making it more electrophilic. So H+ is needed. So A must be a source of H+.

So, looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is the proton source. NaHSO3 would provide H+ as HSO3^- can act as a weak acid, but perhaps it's H+ from H2SO3 or HSO3^-.

Wait, but in the first reaction, to make the cyanohydrin, the typical conditions are acidic, so H3O+ is likely. So A is H3O+.

So then, option A and B have A as H3O+. So now the question is about B.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So the conditions are probably strong acid and water. So B would be HCl, which is a strong acid.

Wait, but in the options, B is either HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). So option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. So that would fit.

But wait, looking again: the second reaction is the cyanohydrin (with OH and CN) reacting with B (which is H2O). So the reagent is B, which is either HCl or acetic acid, perhaps in water.

Wait, but wait, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids often involves HCl (as a catalyst) and H2O under high temperature. Alternatively, under basic conditions with NaOH, followed by acid work-up.

So if B is HCl, that would make sense as the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis. So then, in the second reaction, B is HCl.

So putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (so B is HCl). So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Sometimes, in the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, a strong base like KMnO4 under acidic conditions is used. Wait, no, KMnO4 is more for oxidizing.

Wait, but the other possibility is that the second reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. So B is HCl, providing the acidic conditions.

So in that case, option A would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another possibility: The first reaction uses NaHSO3 as A. What's that for? Hmm, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, maybe in some addition reactions, like with carbonyl groups, bisulfite can be a reagent. But in the first reaction, the reaction is with NaCN. So maybe that's not the case. I think the first step requires H+ from an acid, like H3O+.

So, going back to the options, option A has A = H3O+, B = HCl. So that seems correct.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe in the second reaction, B is a weak acid like acetic acid. But I'm not sure. Because for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, I think you need a strong acid, like HCl, or maybe aqueous H2SO4.

Wait, but in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So CH3COOH is a weak acid. But for complete hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, perhaps a strong acid is needed. So I think B is HCl, as in option A.

So the reagents would be:

Reaction 1: NaCN and H3O+ (so A is H3O+).

Reaction 2: HCl (so B is HCl).

Looking back at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, another thought: Let me make sure the second reaction is indeed a hydrolysis. So the starting material is a nitrile with an adjacent hydroxyl group. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl group would become a hydroxyl and the CN becomes COOH.

Wait, but the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2COOH or something similar? Wait, no, wait but the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is (CH2OH)C(CN)CH2CH3? No, the butanenitrile would be four carbons, but the product is butanoic acid, which is four carbons as well.

Wait, but the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So when it's hydrolyzed, the nitrile becomes a COOH group. So the structure would have both OH and COOH on the same carbon. But wait, that's not possible because a carbon can't have both an -OH and -COOH group unless it's a geminal diol or something, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the structure. Let me think again. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH(CH2CH3)(OH))CN. So when that nitrile is hydrolyzed, it would become (CH(CH2CH3)(OH))COOH. But that would have two groups on the same carbon, which is possible as geminal diols can form, but in this case, it's a geminal hydroxyl and carboxylic acid.

Wait, but that's not possible because having two functional groups on the same carbon usually requires specific conditions, but in reality, it's more likely that the hydroxyl group is part of a larger structure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis occurs under basic conditions, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

If A is H3O+, that's for the first reaction, which requires acid. So options A and B are possible.

For the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid.

If the second reaction is hydrolysis, perhaps using HCl as a catalyst. So option A would be correct.

But wait, another thought: Maybe in the second reaction, the reagent is a strong acid, like HCl, which provides the acidic conditions for the hydrolysis. So B would be HCl, making option A correct.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this to occur, the carbonyl oxygen must be protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. This requires an acidic medium.  
   - Among the options, reagent A must be a source of H⁺. H₃O⁺ (option A and B) is the correct choice, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions. NaHSO₃ (option C and D) is not suitable for this reaction.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (CN) is converted to a carboxylic acid (COOH). Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions.  
   - Among the options, HCl (option A and C) is a strong acid and is suitable for this reaction. CH₃COOH (option B and D), being a weak acid, is less effective for this transformation.

Combining the above analyses:
- For Reaction 1, A = H₃O⁺.  
- For Reaction 2, B = HCl.  

Thus, the correct option is **A**.

Answer: A
