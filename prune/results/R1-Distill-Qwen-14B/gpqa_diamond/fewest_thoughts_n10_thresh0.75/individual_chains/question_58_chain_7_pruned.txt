Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

Wait, what's regularization again? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math blow up. So you add a temporary "cutoff" or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you take the cutoff to infinity in a controlled way. But not all theories might need this, especially if they're already finite or don't produce these divergences.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. The options are A through D. Let's look at each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, and it's supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything. Oh, and because it incorporates higher-dimensional objects and strings vibrating, it's thought to be finite. Because string theories don't have the same loop divergences that other quantum field theories have. So maybe they don't require regularization because their perturbative expansions are finite? So superstring theory might be the one that doesn't need regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). That's the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory with gluons. I think QCD does require regularization because, like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), it's a renormalizable theory. Renormalizable theories usually have divergences that need to be handled with techniques like regularization and renormalization. So B probably needs regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). Yes, I know QED is a textbook example of a quantum field theory. It's renormalizable, but that means it has divergences that require regularization and renormalization. So C does require it.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't deal with quantum divergences because they don't involve the same kind of calculations as quantum field theories. In classical E&M, even things like point charges have issues with infinite self-energy, but those are more conceptual and handled differently, not through regularization. Or maybe classical theories just don't use regularization because regularization is a quantum mechanics thing. So if the question is about whether the theory requires regularization (which is a quantum field theory technique), then classical E&M doesn't need it. Oh, wait, the question is about high energies. Well, classical theories don't really apply at high energies because they don't account for quantum effects. But the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if the option is classical, it doesn't use regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. The question is about a physical theory that never requires regularization. So I need to compare all the options.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization—so which one is always finite or doesn't have the same kind of divergences.

So, for QED and QCD, they are renormalizable but deal with divergences by regularization. String theory is supposed to be finite, but I'm not 100% sure. I think
