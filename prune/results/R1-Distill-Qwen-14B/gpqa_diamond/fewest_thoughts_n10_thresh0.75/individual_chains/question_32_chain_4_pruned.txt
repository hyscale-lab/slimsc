Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, when objects are moving at speeds close to c, their energy increases due to relativistic effects. 

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons (3 protons + 3 neutrons). Oh wait, so the nucleus is Li-6. Right, because Li has atomic number 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. 

So I need to calculate the relativistic energy of a Li-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c. The energy in such cases is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

Let me jot down the formula: E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, what's the rest mass of Li-6? Li has an atomic mass of about 6.941 g/mol, but I think it's better to look it up as the mass number. Oh wait, the mass number A is approximately the number of nucleons. Li-6 has A=6, so the mass is about 6 atomic mass units (u). 

But wait, I should be precise. The exact mass of Li-6 might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the known values. Wait, each nucleon (proton and neutron) has a mass of about 1.007276 u for protons and 1.008665 u for neutrons. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. 

So let's calculate the mass: 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) / something? Wait, no, wait: 3 protons each 1.007276 u, 3 neutrons each 1.008665 u.

So 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u, and 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u. Summing them gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u. So the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.047823 u. 

But wait, I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.047 atomic mass units. So that's correct. 

Now, to convert that into kilograms, because the standard unit for mass in physics is kg. One atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m = 6.047823 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u. Let me compute that.

6.047823 * 1.660539e-27 = let's see, 6 * 1.66e-27 is about 9.96e-27, but more accurately:

6.047823 * 1.6605390666e-27 = Let me compute this. 

6.047823 * 1.6605390666 is approximately let's compute 6 * 1.6605 is about 9.963, but more precisely:

6.047823 * 1.6605390666 ≈ 

Let me approximate:

1.660539 * 6 = 9.963234
1.660539 * 0.047823 ≈ 0.0795. So total is about 9.963234 + 0.0795 ≈ 10.0427. 

So 10.0427e-27 kg. Wait, no, wait: 6.047823 * 1.660539e-27 = 10.042
