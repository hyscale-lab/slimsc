Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a certain nucleus travel at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when dealing with particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use relativistic equations. 

The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

I think the first thing I need to find is the rest mass of this nucleus. But wait, how do I find the rest mass of Li-6? I remember that the mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the masses of its individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy and the mass defect. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe I can approximate it using the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, another thought: in particle physics, when dealing with heavy ions, the rest mass of the ion is often considered as the sum of the rest masses of its nucleons. Because the binding energy is much smaller compared to the rest mass of the nucleus, especially for light elements. So maybe I can just calculate the mass as 6 times the mass of a proton (since Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and protons and neutrons have almost the same mass).

Wait, but the neutron is slightly heavier than the proton. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for each neutron, it's about 1.565 MeV more. But since we're dealing with 3 neutrons, the total would be 3 * 1.565 = ~4.695 MeV. So the nucleus's mass would be 3*(proton) + 3*(neutron) = 3*(938) +3*(939.565) = let's calculate that.

Wait, 3*(938 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.565) = 563
