Okay, so I've been given this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, but this looks like a two-dimensional metric, since it's in terms of x and y. Oh right, maybe it's part of a higher-dimensional spacetime, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, so perhaps it's a 2-sphere embedded in some space.

Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Or wait, maybe in this context, it's referring to a sphere in a space with a different metric. Wait, but the term 'pseudosphere' sometimes can be a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sphere with hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, the metric given is a bit strange. The denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²). Hmm, so the coefficient is 32/(4 - (x² + y²)). So this is a conformal metric, meaning it's a scaling of the flat Euclidean metric in 2D. Conformal factors often relate to curvature.

I'm a bit confused about how to find the area here. I think the area would be calculated using the standard formula for a 2-sphere, but perhaps modified by the metric's properties. Wait, in general relativity, the
