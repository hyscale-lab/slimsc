Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretching. So, this suggests the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak too. But I'm not sure yet.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds or an amide). Wait, but if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's something like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch, but that usually is a bit lower in wavenumber. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably somewhere in the structure. So maybe an alkene is present.

Now the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give m/z 45? Let me think. Common fragments at 45 might be from a CH3CO (acetate) group, which would be (CH3CO+) with a mass of 45. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O? Wait, let's calculate. CH3CO is 12 + 1*2 +12 + 16 = 45? Wait, 12 (C) + 1 (H3) + 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 45. Yes, that's right. So if the compound has an acetate group, that could explain the m/z 45 fragment.

Now, considering the options given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. The possible formulas.

Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation (DoU) is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N mentioned, we can ignore them.

Option A: C6H12O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond.

Option B: C6H10O
DoU = (12 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings/bonds.
