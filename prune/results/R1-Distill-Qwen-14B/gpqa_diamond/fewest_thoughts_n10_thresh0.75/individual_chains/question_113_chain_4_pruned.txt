Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the FTIR data. The question says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because of the hydrogen bonding. So that could mean the compound has either an alcohol (-OH) or a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C in conjugation), but since there's a peak at 1700, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an ester? Wait, esters have two carbonyls? No, wait. Let me think. For esters, the carbonyl is usually around 1740, but if it's an acid, it's around 1700. Wait, but 1700 is also where ketones or aldehydes are, but if the peak is very strong, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Hmm, but there's also a peak at 1650, which is a bit lower. Could that be a conjugated double bond, like in a ketone or maybe an aromatic ring?

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like CH₂=CH. So that suggests the molecule has a double bond, maybe an alkene. So, that fits with an IR peak around 1650, which could be a C=C stretching. So putting that together, the IR has a broad peak (maybe O-H), a strong peak at 1700 (C=O), and another at 1650 (maybe C=C). So perhaps the compound has both an O-H group and a carbonyl, maybe in an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the mass spectrum: the fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether), but wait, that's
