Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The problem says there are two stars with exactly the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same star mass, same planet mass. Interesting.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P))^(1/3)

Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ), but since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i is roughly 1 for edge-on orbits (which we usually assume for detected planets). So maybe K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this problem, M_p is the same for both planets (both Neptune-like), and M_* is the same (solar mass). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because all other factors are same.

Wait, if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and 2, then:

K1 / K2 = ( (P2/P1) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, wait. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 = C / (P1^(1/3)), K2 = C / (P2^(1/3)).

Then, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, taking the ratio:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait no, let's re-express this correctly. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So, if K1 is smaller than K2, then P1 would be larger than P2? Wait no, let me think again. Let's say K1 = 5, K2=7.

Wait, K is the semi-amplitude. A larger K means a bigger Doppler shift, which implies a more massive planet or a shorter period? Wait, but in our case, the planet masses are same, so it must be due to the period.

Wait, from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3)).

So, if K increases, since M_p and M_* are same, P must decrease. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, if K is larger, P is smaller.

So, back to the problem: Planet #1 has K1=5, Planet #2 has K2=7. Since K2>K1, that implies that P2 < P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 = x * P1. We are to find x.

Wait, the ratio would be P2/P1 = (something). Let me get back to the formula.

Since K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^3.

So P1 is proportional to 1/K1^3, and P2 is proportional to 1/K2^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Calculating 5/7 is approximately 0.714. So (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait: That would mean P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So the orbital period of planet #2 is ~0.364 times that of planet #1, which is about 0.36 times longer. Wait, no, 0.364 times P1 is shorter, so P2 is shorter. But the question asks how many times longer P2's period is than P1. If P2 is shorter, then x is less than 1.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check.

If P2 = x * P1, and x is P2/P1.

So, from the ratio:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So x is about 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, no. Wait, 0.36 times P1. So that would mean P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364. So P2 is approximately 36% the period of P1. So, it's about 36% of P1, which would make it shorter.

But the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 longer than P1 by a factor of x. Wait, but if x is 0.36, that would imply P2 is shorter. So I think I might have made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), so K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, that's correct. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1).

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Which is (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of approximately 0.364. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So it's shorter. So the ratio is about 0.36.

So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since 0.36 is less than 1, P2 is shorter. So the correct answer is 0.36 times as long, which is about 0.36 times longer? Wait, no, the question is asking for how many times longer. So P2's period is 0.36 times as long as P1's, meaning it's shorter, so the number would be 0.36 times as long, so it's 0.36 times. So the answer would be 0.36, which corresponds to option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Because sometimes when dealing with ratios, it's easy to mix up which is numerator and denominator.

Wait, the formula says P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

(5/7)^3 = (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is 0.364 * P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So it's shorter.

So, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since the masses of the stars and planets are the same, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) corresponds to the inverse ratio of the orbital periods raised to the power of \( 1/3 \):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of the orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

First, compute \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \). Then, cube this value:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \) is approximately \( 0.364 \) times \( P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is about \( 0.36 \) times as long as that of planet #1. This indicates that planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1.

From the options provided, the closest match is:
