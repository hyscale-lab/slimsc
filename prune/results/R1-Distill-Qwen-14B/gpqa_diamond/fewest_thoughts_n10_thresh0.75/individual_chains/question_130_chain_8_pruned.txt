Okay, so I've got this question here about redshift and detecting something with optical telescopes. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember. So, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But if the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen clouds, then the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength due to redshift.

So, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to the rest wavelength lambda_rest by 1 + z = lambda_obs / lambda_rest. Because when the universe expands, the wavelength stretches, so the observed wavelength is larger than the rest.

But wait, the quasar emits light that's being absorbed. So, the background quasar's Lyman-alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but when it's absorbed by the hydrogen cloud at some redshift z, the wavelength of that absorption line would be 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

Now, the issue is whether this absorption line can be observed with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range, which is roughly between 400 and 700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but 1216 Angstroms is in the far ultraviolet. So if the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms, we need that to be in the optical range for ground-based telescopes to see it.

So let's compute when 1216*(1+z) is greater than or equal to 4000 Angstroms, because that's when it's in the optical range. Let's set up the inequality.

1216*(1 + z) >= 4000

Divide both sides by 1216:

1 + z >= 4000 / 1216
