Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about figuring out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's see what I can remember.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Wait, that's a norbornene derivative. Norbornene has that bicyclic structure, right? And the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So that's like a bulky oxygen group attached.

Next, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh, right, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, especially with polar aprotic solvents, but wait, the solvent isn't mentioned here. The reaction conditions are elevated temperature, so maybe it's an elimination or substitution reaction.

Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexadiene with two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being a dibromomethyl group. Each of those would have two bromine atoms attached to a methyl group, right? So each substituent is -(CH2Br)2, I think. Wait no, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) means that each of the 5 and 6 positions has a methyl group that's dibrominated. So each is CH2Br2. So each substituent is a CH2Br2 group.

So when this reacts with the norbornene compound, which has an oxygen with a tert-butyl group, maybe it's undergoing some kind of elimination? Or perhaps a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So maybe an SN2 reaction is happening.

Wait, but in the norbornene structure, the oxygen is attached to the bicyclic ring. So if the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy), then perhaps the oxygen is a leaving group? But wait, the leaving group would need to be a good one. In this case, the tert-butoxy group is O-tBu. So if the oxygen is attached to the ring, maybe the ring has a leaving group adjacent to it? But in this case, the starting material doesn't seem to have a leaving group. Hmm.

Wait a second, maybe the norbornene is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the other compound is a dienophile? Wait, the norbornene is a bicyclic diene. The other compound, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is a conjugated diene as well. So maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornene is acting as the diene and the other compound as the dienophile?

Wait, but the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexene. So if it's a dienophile, perhaps the reaction would form a six-membered ring adduct.

Alternatively, maybe it's a [4+2] cycloaddition. Let me think, the norbornene has a conjugated diene. The other compound is a cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups. So perhaps the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile.

But wait, the other molecule is a cyclohexadiene, which may not be a good dienophile. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a ring-opening or some other reaction. Or perhaps it's a substitution where the iodide is displacing something.

Wait, the presence of two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene suggests that two molecules might be reacting with the starting material. So perhaps the starting material has two sites for substitution.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Let me draw this structure mentally. Bicyclo[2.2.1] is like norbornene; the structure has two bridgehead carbons, and the substituent is on the bridge. So position 7 is one of the bridgeheads. The tert-butoxy is attached there.

So the structure is:

O
|
O-tBu attached to the bridgehead.

Now, when this reacts with 2 equivalents of the cyclohexadiene and NaI, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is being replaced. But wait, O-tBu is a poor leaving group. Maybe the reaction is an elimination, but that would form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the iodide is displacing a bromide or something else.

Wait, perhaps the other molecule is undergoing elimination. The 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two bromines on each methyl group. So each CH2Br2 group could act as a leaving group in some way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the iodide replaces the bromide. No, wait, the cyclohexadiene has CH2Br2 groups. So perhaps the Br is being displaced by iodide.

Wait, but the starting material is the norbornene, so perhaps the reaction is adding the cyclohexadiene across the norbornene in a Diels-Alder fashion.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is opening up? Wait, norbornene can undergo ring-opening under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition across the double bonds. Wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling reaction. But with sodium iodide and elevated temperature, perhaps it's an example of a Fittig or similar coupling, but that usually involves aryl halides.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product formation steps.

The product 1 is formed by combining the starting material with two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene and NaI. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4.

We're to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens in product 4.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the possible reactions and the structures that would form.

First step: Starting material is a norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. It reacts with two equivalents of cyclohexadiene, which has two dibromomethyl groups, and NaI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the tert-butoxy group is replaced by something. But O-tBu is a poor leaving group, so maybe it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile, and the norbornene is the diene, leading to a Diels-Alder adduct. But norbornene is a bicyclic diene, so the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring fused to the norbornene. But that might not directly explain the use of NaI here.

Wait, maybe the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. If each has two bromines on a methyl, perhaps elimination occurs, leading to alkenes. But with two equivalents, maybe each cyclohexadiene molecule loses two equivalents of HBr, forming a diene.

Wait, but each cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups. So perhaps each molecule of cyclohexadiene can lose two HBr molecules, forming two double bonds. But then, the structure would become more conjugated.

Wait, but the starting cyclohexadiene is already a diene. If each CH2Br2 group loses two HBr molecules, each would form a double bond.

Wait, if a CH2Br2 group loses two HBr, perhaps it becomes a CH2 group, but that doesn't form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that each CH2Br2 group becomes a CH2Br group, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the iodide displaces the bromide. So, for each cyclohexadiene molecule, the CH2Br2 groups would react with iodide to form CH2I and CH2Br, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but each cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups. So maybe each reacts with two equivalents of iodide. So each CH2Br2 would become CH2I2? But that doesn't seem right because CH2I2 is not a stable group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling. For example, the dibromomethyl groups could undergo a coupling reaction, such as a Ullmann or similar, but that's usually under copper catalysis, which isn't mentioned here.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Each CH2Br2 group loses two Br- in an E2 mechanism, forming a double bond. So each cyclohexadiene, which already has a double bond, might form a more substituted diene.

Wait, but each cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups. If each group loses two HBr molecules, perhaps each becomes a CH2 group, but that would require each CH2Br2 losing two Br's, which would be a dehalogenation.

Wait, maybe each CH2Br2 group undergoes dehydrohalogenation to become CH2. But that would require elimination, perhaps using a strong base. But NaI is more of a nucleophile than a base. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm not making progress on the first step. Let me think about the possible products and subsequent reactions.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. That sounds like a sulfonation or perhaps a sulfonamide formation, but more likely, it's a sulfonation.

Wait, SO3 in DMSO and pyridine is used in the Hinsberg test, which is a reaction to determine if a compound is a sulfonamide or an amine. But wait, in this case, product 2 must have an amine group because SO3 would react with it. So, perhaps product 2 is an amine.

Wait, but how does the first step lead to an amine? Let's think again. Maybe the initial reaction introduces an amine group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a diiodide, which upon treatment with H2SO4 would lead to some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another idea: the starting material has an ether group (tert-butoxy). What if that's undergoing some kind of elimination. Wait, elimination would form an alkene, but the starting material is already a diene. So perhaps the tert-butoxy group is replaced by something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. For example, if the norbornene opens up when reacting with a dienophile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a substitution reaction where the tert-butoxy group is replaced by a larger group.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile, and the norbornene is the diene. So a Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring.

But wait, the norbornene is a bicyclic molecule. When it reacts in a Diels-Alder reaction, it would add across the dienophile, creating a new six-membered ring. Let's imagine that the norbornene's two double bonds are in positions that would allow for a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, the norbornene has two double bonds? No, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which means it has two double bonds: between C2-C3 and C5-C6.

Wait, no, actually, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds. So the structure is a norbornene with two double bonds. So maybe the Diels-Alder reaction uses one of them as a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile and the norbornene is the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, leading to a new six-membered ring.

But considering that two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene are used, perhaps two molecules of the dienophile are reacting with the norbornene. That could form a bridged structure.

Wait, but the norbornene has two double bonds. Maybe each reacts with a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile, leading to a Diels-Alder adduct. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cross metathesis, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a ring-opening of the norbornene by the cyclohexadiene. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is being replaced by a group from the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, the cyclohexadiene has CH2Br2 groups. So if the norbornene's O-tBu is a good leaving group, perhaps it's being displaced by a group from the cyclohexadiene. But O-tBu isn't a great leaving group. Maybe under elevated temperatures with a nucleophile like iodide, perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is undergoing a substitution where the O-tBu is replaced by a group from the cyclohexadiene. But the cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups, each of which has two bromines. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is undergoing a coupling with the norbornene. For example, a coupling that forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but without knowing the exact reaction, it's a bit tough. Let me think about the possible product.

Product 1 is formed after reacting with two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene and NaI. So perhaps each cyclohexadiene is reacting with the starting material in a way that two substituents are added.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a 1,4-addition with the cyclohexadiene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the O-tBu is replaced by an iodide, but then what happens with two equivalents?

Wait, the starting material is a norbornene with O-tBu. If the O-tBu is a leaving group, perhaps it's replaced by an iodide from NaI, but then each substitution would require one equivalent. Since there are two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene, perhaps each norbornene is reacting with two cyclohexadiene molecules.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2.

H2SO4 is a strong acid. It could cause elimination reactions, protonation leading to ring openings, or perhaps acid-catalyzed rearrangements. For example, if product 1 has some substituents that can undergo elimination, like adjacent protons, then H2SO4 would protonate and cause the elimination.

Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is typically used for sulfonation of alcohols or amines. So perhaps product 2 has an alcohol or amine group that reacts with SO3 to form a sulfonate ester or sulfonamide.

Wait, but the H2SO4 step could be for protonating and forming an intermediate that then reacts. For instance, if product 1 is a diol, then H2SO4 might cause dehydration to form a diene or a ring contraction. Alternatively, if product 1 has some rings that are strained, acid could cause them to open.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 has some bromide or iodide leaving groups, and the H2SO4 is causing an elimination.

Wait, but the first step involved NaI, which is a source of iodide. So perhaps in product 1, there are iodide groups attached.

Let me go back. The first step uses two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene (which has two CH2Br2 groups) and NaI. Maybe the iodide is causing a substitution, replacing Br with I.

Wait, perhaps each cyclohexadiene molecule is reacting with two equivalents of NaI. So each CH2Br2 in the cyclohexadiene could be substituted twice, replacing each Br with I, leading to CH2I2 groups. But that's not possible because CH2I2 is not a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 group reacts once, replacing one Br with I, leading to CH2BrI.

But that would require each cyclohexadiene to have two CH2BrI groups, but the reaction is with two equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is undergoing a coupling reaction where the Br is replaced by a bond to the norbornene.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a substitution where the O-tBu is replaced by a cyclohexadienyl group. But with two equivalents, perhaps each substitution is occurring on different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,2-addition across the double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. For example, the norbornene could open up to form a diradical or a diene, which then reacts with the cyclohexadiene.

But I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me think about the overall process.

The initial compound is a norbornene derivative. It reacts with two equivalents of a cyclohexadiene that has dibromomethyl groups. Then, after H2SO4, then SO3 and pyridine, then heating to form product 4.

Product 4's structure will determine the number of distinct hydrogens. So perhaps the final product is a polycyclic compound with symmetry, leading to fewer distinct H's.

Wait, maybe the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction, which adds two cyclohexadiene molecules across the norbornene's double bonds. But norbornene is a bicyclic molecule; adding two dienophiles might form a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that usually forms strained rings and isn't as common without specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps each cyclohexadiene molecule is adding across one of the double bonds of the norbornene. So two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding a cyclohexadiene across a double bond of the norbornene. But norbornene has two double bonds, perhaps each can undergo a Diels-Alder with a cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it has two double bonds. If each reacts with a cyclohexadiene in a Diels-Alder, then the product would have two new six-membered rings attached to the norbornene.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is the diene in a Diels-Alder, and the norbornene is the dienophile. But in that case, the norbornene would have to have a single double bond, which it doesn't.

Wait, maybe it's a different type of cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, but that's less common.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. For instance, the cyclohexadiene could add across the norbornene's double bonds in a 1,4-addition.

But I'm not making progress on the first step. Let's consider what happens in the subsequent steps.

After product 1 is treated with H2SO4 to form product 2, which is then treated with SO3, pyridine, and DMSO to form product 3.

The SO3 in DMSO and pyridine is often used in the sulfonation of amines, forming sulfonamides. So product 2 must have a primary or secondary amine.

Wait, so product 2 has an amine group. Then, treating with SO3 would convert that amine into a sulfonamide.

But how does the first step introduce an amine group? Maybe the first reaction forms an amine.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a diol, which upon treatment with H2SO4 undergoes some kind of elimination to form a diene, and then product 2 has a diene.

But then, how does product 2 have an amine group? Unless another reaction forms an amine. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a diiodide, which upon treatment with H2SO4 undergoes elimination to form a diene. But then where does the amine come from?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction produces a compound with vicinal dihalides, which upon treatment with H2O and H2SO4 could undergo elimination to form a double bond.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the final product and the number of H's.

The final step is heating product 3 at 150 C. Heating can cause elimination or rearrangement reactions. If product 3 is a sulfonamide, maybe heating causes it to lose SO2 or something else.

But perhaps in product 3, the sulfonamide is formed, and upon heating, it rearranges or loses some groups to form a more conjugated or aromatic structure.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a naphthalene derivative or some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which would have a certain number of equivalent H's.

Alternatively, the final product might have multiple rings, leading to symmetry and fewer distinct H's.

Wait, let's think about the possible hydrogen count in the final product.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are 4, 7, 8, or 10. Those are all relatively small numbers, so perhaps the final product has some symmetry, leading to a limited number of distinct H environments.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the entire reaction sequence is leading to the formation of a molecule with a lot of equivalent H's, such as a highly symmetric structure.

For example, if the product is a molecule like cubane, which has a high degree of symmetry and thus fewer distinct H's, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a norbornene derivative with multiple substituents arranged symmetrically.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is a norbornene derivative with several substituents that are arranged in a way that creates equivalent H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridged bicyclic compound with multiple substituents that are symmetrically arranged.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging to count the H's.

Alternatively, maybe the reactions are leading to the formation of a more complex polycyclic compound, such as a tricyclic or tetracyclic structure, which would have a certain number of equivalent H's.

Wait, perhaps the initial Diels-Alder adds two cyclohexadiene molecules to the norbornene, forming a more complex structure. Then, the subsequent steps modify substituents, possibly leading to a symmetrical structure.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of each step again.

First step: norbornene with O-tBu reacts with two equivalents of cyclohexadiene and NaI.

Perhaps the reaction is a double substitution where the O-tBu is replaced by a cyclohexadienyl group. But with two equivalents, perhaps each substitution is on a different position.

Wait, but the norbornene has two bridgeheads. So perhaps each bridgehead undergoes a substitution, replacing O-tBu with a cyclohexadienyl group.

But that would require two substitution reactions, each on a different bridgehead.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene's double bonds are reacting with the cyclohexadiene via Diels-Alder to form two new rings.

Alternatively, perhaps each cyclohexadiene adds across a double bond of the norbornene, leading to a fused ring structure.

But without a clear mechanism, it's difficult.

After the first step, product 1 is treated with H2SO4. If product 1 is a diiodide, H2SO4 could cause elimination to form a diene. Alternatively, if product 1 has some leaving groups, the acid could protonate and eliminate.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. So perhaps product 2 has an alcohol group that gets sulfonated. Or, as I thought earlier, an amine that forms a sulfonamide.

Wait, if the first step forms a diol, then H2SO4 could cause dehydration to form a double bond. But then product 2 would have a double bond. Then, treating with SO3 might not make sense unless there's an -OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a primary or secondary amine, which then reacts with SO3 to form a sulfonamide.

But how would the first step form an amine? Maybe through a substitution reaction where an -NH2 group is introduced.

Wait, perhaps the initial substitution replaces O-tBu with an amine group, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene has some amine functionality, but the initial description doesn't mention that.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should think about the possible products and the number of H's.

If the final product 4 is a highly symmetrical molecule, the number of distinct H's would be low. For example, if it's a cube-like structure, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, if the final product has several equivalent H's due to symmetry across the molecule, such as in a bicyclo structure with mirror planes.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reactions are leading to the formation of a molecule with multiple rings, each contributing a certain number of H's. For example, if the product is a tricyclic compound with substituents in symmetrical positions, the H's might be equivalent.

But I'm not able to visualize the structure. Maybe I should think of the answer options.

The options are 4, 7, 8, or 10. The correct answer is likely to be 7 or 10, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule like adamantane, which has 10 H's. But adamantane has 12 carbons and 10 H's, but I'm not certain.

Wait, adamantane has a structure with four rings, but it has only 10 H's. Let me think: adamantane's structure is four fused cyclohexane rings, with a high degree of symmetry. Each carbon is CH2, but in reality, adamantane has more complex structure.

Wait, no, adamantane has 12 carbons, each in a CH2 group. Wait, no, each bridgehead in adamantane is a CH group. So maybe the number of H's is 18? Because each CH2 contributes 2 H's, but bridgeheads are CH.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing structures. Alternatively, maybe the final product is not adamantane.

Another thought: maybe the final product is a molecule with several bridgehead positions, each with equivalent H's. For example, if two bridgehead positions each have a CH group, those H's would be equivalent, reducing the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has several rings leading to multiple equivalent H's.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to count.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct H's in the final product is 10, which is option C. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a structure where every H is part of a symmetric environment, leading to only 4 distinct H's. For example, if the molecule has four equivalent positions, each with a unique H.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, I'm between 4,7,8,10.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: perhaps the overall process is a synthesis leading to a molecule with a certain number of rings, each contributing a specific number of H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm stuck. So perhaps I should take a different approach.

Wait, the initial compound is a norbornene derivative. After the first reaction, perhaps it's adding two cyclohexadiene units across the double bonds, forming a larger structure. Then, after acid treatment and sulfonation, perhaps a sulfonamide is formed, which upon heating forms a more stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several bridgehead positions, each with equivalent H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with two substituents that are arranged symmetrically. For example, if two substituents are added in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, then the number of H's would be reduced.

In that case, the number of distinct H's could be 7 or 8. For example, if the molecule has a bicyclo structure with substituents leading to seven unique H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has seven unique H's due to the arrangement of substituents and the presence of symmetry.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, considering all the steps and possibility of symmetry, perhaps the correct answer is 7.


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (product 4) of a multi-step reaction sequence. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. This is followed by treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid, SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO, and finally heating at 150°C.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Step**: The starting material, a norbornene derivative with a bulky tert-butoxy group, reacts with two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene derivative. The reaction conditions suggest substitution or cycloaddition. The cyclohexadiene has two CH₂Br₂ groups, which may undergo substitution or elimination. Sodium iodide (NaI) could facilitate substitution, replacing bromine atoms with iodine. The reaction likely forms a product with iodinated or modified substituents.

2. **Second Step**: Treatment of product 1 with aqueous H₂SO₄ likely causes elimination or rearrangement, potentially forming a more conjugated structure or introducing functional groups such as alcohols or amines.

3. **Third Step**: Reaction with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO suggests sulfonation or sulfonamide formation. This step likely converts an alcohol or amine group in product 2 into a sulfonated derivative.

4. **Final Step**: Heating product 3 at 150°C could lead to further rearrangement, elimination, or stabilization of the structure, resulting in a final product with a specific number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

### Symmetry and Hydrogen Count:
The final product is likely a polycyclic compound with significant symmetry due to the reaction sequence. Symmetry reduces the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the options provided (4, 7, 8, 10), the most plausible number of distinct hydrogen atoms, considering the reaction steps and potential symmetry in the final product, is **7**.

Answer: D
