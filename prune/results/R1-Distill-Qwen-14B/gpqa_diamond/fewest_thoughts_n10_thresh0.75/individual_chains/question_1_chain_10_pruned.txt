Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Hmm, but how exactly do the lifetimes relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right! The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt) of the state. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / (Δt). But which Δt do we use here? Wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Because each state's energy is uncertain by its own ΔE. So the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable would be when ΔE is greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Or wait, maybe the maximum uncertainty is the larger of the two. Let me think.

Wait, let me get the formula straight. For a single state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime of the state. So for the first state, which has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, ΔE1 = ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2, where τ2 is 1e-8 sec. Since τ2 is longer, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

So which one is more important? The energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps their sum. Wait, I think the minimal requirement is that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy. But since each state has its own uncertainty, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the uncertainty in the energy difference. Hmm, maybe it's the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, not sure. Let me think. The energy difference's uncertainty would be the combination of the uncertainties from each state. Since E1 and E2 each have their own ΔE, the total uncertainty in the difference (E2 - E1) would be the root of the sum
