Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. Oh right, it's about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So these are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems, right? So they form an orthonormal basis.

First, I think I need to normalize the state because it's given as proportional. The state isn't normalized yet, so I should calculate the normalization factor. Let's denote the state as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 -i). The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So the inner product is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let's compute |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 =2. Because (1+i)(1-i) is 1 -i^2, and i^2 is -1, so 1 - (-1) = 2. Similarly, |b|^2 is (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i - 2i + (i^2)*(-1). Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly. (2-i)(2+i) = 2^2 + (i)(2) - (i)(2) -i^2. Hmm, that's 4 + (2i -2i) + 1 because i^2 is -1, so it's 4+0 +1=5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, (2)^2 is 4, and (i)(-i) is -i^2, which is +1. So 4 +1=5? Wait, (2 -i)(2+i) = 4 +2i -2i -i² → 4 - (-1) =5. Yes, that's right.

So the total norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator with matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if i !=j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems. So the operator matrix looks like:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So this is an operator where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. That looks familiar—this is similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by some factor. Let me think: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply X by hbar/2, we get exactly this matrix. So this operator is (hbar/2) * σx.

Hmm, because the Pauli matrices have eigenstates that are the eigenstates of σx, which are |+x> and |-x>, given by (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because the operator is proportional to σx. But perhaps the eigenstates are the same but with different eigenvalues.

But wait, what are the eigenvalues of this operator? Since it's (hbar/2) * σx, and σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ±hbar/2.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator when the state is |alpha>. Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability of the outcome corresponding to each eigenvalue.

Wait, but the operator in question is the one whose matrix is given. So, to find the probabilities, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because when you measure an operator, the probability is the square of the amplitude of each eigenstate in the state.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A, which are the same as the eigenstates of σx, since A is a multiple of σx. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought earlier.

Wait, let me write them down. |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is already expressed in terms of |up> and |down>. So perhaps it's easier to compute the expansion coefficients into |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σx, perhaps I can find the expectation value more directly, but I think we're being asked for the probabilities for each eigenstate, which would correspond to the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue, so each eigenstate's coefficient.

So let's proceed. Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

Then, the probability of measuring the corresponding eigenvalue is |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Hmm, but let's compute this. Let me express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

Let's express this in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Substituting |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

Since |up> = (|+x> + |-x> ) / sqrt(2)
and |down> = (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2)

So,

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> + |-x> )/sqrt(2) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(7)*1/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(14):

So,

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x> ) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x> ) ] / sqrt(14)

Let's distribute the terms inside:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Combine like terms for |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> terms: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i [since (1+i)+(2-i) = 3 +0i ]
|-x> terms: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i)

So,

|alpha> = [ (3)|+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Therefore, the coefficients are c1 = 3/sqrt(14) and c2 = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14)

Now, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2. Let's compute them.

|c1|^2 = (3)^2 / (sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is about 0.643. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64, option D has 0.61. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857, so that's approximately 0.64. So the probability for |+x> is about 0.64, and for |-x> it's |c2|^2.

Compute |c2|^2:

c2 is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357. So approximately
