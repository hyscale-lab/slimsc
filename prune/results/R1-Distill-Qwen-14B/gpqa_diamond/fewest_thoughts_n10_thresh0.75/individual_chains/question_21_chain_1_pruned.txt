Okay, so I'm trying to answer this chemistry question, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Let me break it down.

First, the question has two parts: A and B.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: Which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

I'll tackle each part separately.

Starting with Part A: Tautomerism. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different structures (tautomers) by the movement of a hydrogen atom along with the migration of a pi bond. For this to happen, the molecule must have adjacent double bonds or a conjugated system that allows the hydrogen to move.

Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is typically a cyclic structure with two ketone groups across the ring. So, it's similar to benzene with two oxygen atoms as part of the ring, I think. Wait, no, quinones are typically 1,4-diketones. So benzoquinone would have two ketone groups in para positions on the benzene ring.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring. So, three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. That would make it a symmetrical molecule since they're all equidistant.

Tautomerismâ€”does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I recall that quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait, for keto-enol tautomerism, you need a conjugated system. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Each ketone is part of the ring, so they are conjugated with the aromatic system. So, maybe benzoquinone can undergo some tautomerism. Hmm, but wait, when I think about enol tautomerism, you usually have a carbonyl group adjacent to an alpha hydrogen. In benzoquinone, each ketone is part of the ring; they don't have adjacent alpha hydrogens because the ring
