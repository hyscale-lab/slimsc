Okay, so I've got this physics problem about atomic nucleus fission. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: An atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy (T1) of the more massive fragment and the one calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. So, first, I should probably recall that in nuclear fission, the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, and because of conservation of energy and momentum, they move in opposite directions with some kinetic energy.

Wait, the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial mass: M
- Initial rest-mass energy: 300 GeV. So M*c² = 300 GeV, but since we're dealing with energy in GeV and masses in terms of M, maybe I can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So M = 300 GeV/c², but perhaps it won't matter because in equations, c factors will cancel out.

The two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say the masses are m1 and m2, with m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of the initial mass.

So substituting m1 = 2m2 into the sum equation:

2m2 + m2 = 99% M → 3m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Therefore, m1 = 0.66 M.

So m1 is 0.66M, m2 is 0.33M.

Wait, but the sum is 0.99 M, which is less than M. That's because some mass is converted into kinetic energy and maybe other particles, but the problem says that nothing else is produced except the two fragments. So, the rest of the mass (1% of M) must have been converted into kinetic energy. Ah, but actually, in reality, some mass is converted into kinetic energy, but in this problem, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is the rest energy, so when it splits, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 * M. So the mass deficit is 0.01 M, which would be converted into kinetic energy and maybe binding energy or neutrinos, but in this problem, perhaps they're considering only the kinetic energy as the deficit. Hmm, but I need to clarify that.

Wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest mass energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * M * c², which would be 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the remaining energy is 3 GeV, which should be the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, but in reality, the rest mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energy plus any other forms of energy (like binding energy or radiation) should equal the initial rest mass energy. But the problem says that only the two fragments are produced, so perhaps the rest mass deficit of 3 GeV is entirely converted into kinetic energy. But wait, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is
