Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, right.

Alright, let me read the question again. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D. 

First, I think the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't use classical velocity addition. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, noâ€”that formula is for when you're adding two velocities in different frames. But wait, here we're talking about the relative speed between two objects in the same inertial frame. Hmm, so in that case, do I treat it as the difference between their velocities?

Wait, no, no. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract them directly. Because each is in their own inertial frame, but in the problem statement, they're both moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second? Or wait, no, maybe the problem is considering the relative speed from the perspective of one of them. Or perhaps it's the speed as measured in the rest frame where one of them is at rest. Oh, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says "relative speed." So, when two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds. But in relativity, that's not exactly correct. Wait, but in the same inertial frame, their relative speed would just be the difference because both are in the same frame. Hmm, but wait, no, that's only true if you're in a frame where both are moving. If you're in another frame, the relative speed would be different. Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the relative speed is the speed of one as observed from the other's frame. So, for instance, what's the speed of the 3m astronaut as seen from the 2m astronaut's frame, or vice versa.
