Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I've studied relativity before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit being c. So, to find the relative speed between them, I can't just subtract the two speeds. I'll need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity, right. If object A is moving at u and object B at v, then the relative speed of A with respect to B is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So plugging in, the numerator is 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²). Let me compute that denominator:

0.6 *0.5 is 0.3. So the denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, some have 0.14c as a relative speed.

But wait, is that the relative speed? Because when you're in one frame moving at speed v, the other object's speed is u - v, but the formula accounts for the relativistic effects. So yes, this calculation should give the correct relative speed. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which is option C and D.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the system. Oh wait, total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut has their own energy, which is gamma times mc². But wait, their masses are 2m and 3m, so I should compute the energy for each and add them.

Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute gamma for each astronaut.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.
Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.
Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -
