Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm, let me think. The question says that a textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, and I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about conjugated pi systems and how they relate to the energy of light. Oh right, conjugated systems have extended pi bonds, which affect the wavelength of light absorbed. The more conjugation, the longer the wavelength absorbed, I think. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, more conjugation leads to lower energy transition because the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels decreases. So lower energy means longer wavelength. 

But wait, the question is about the color of light absorbed. Oh, right! When a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it doesn't emit that same wavelength. Instead, it emits a different one. Because when electrons get excited, they go to a higher energy state, and then when they drop back, they emit light. So the emitted light is at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed, I think. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the photon emitted when the electron drops from a higher to lower energy state. But what about the absorbed light? Electrons get excited from the ground state to a higher energy state when they absorb light. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted
