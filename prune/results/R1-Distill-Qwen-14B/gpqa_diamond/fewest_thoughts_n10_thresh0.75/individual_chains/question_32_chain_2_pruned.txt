Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, right, RHIC collides heavy ions, so I guess I'm dealing with relativistic mechanics here.

First, I need to determine what nucleus X is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium atom has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

Now, the problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Or is it the total energy? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC," which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. But sometimes, especially in high-energy physics, they might refer to the total energy. Hmm, I'll have to be careful here.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed..." So maybe they're asking for the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. Or perhaps they're just giving the kinetic energy. I need to clarify that.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps the energy is the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, and when they collide, their kinetic energy contributes to the collision energy. But in any case, the problem probably wants the total energy, which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

So, to find the total energy, we can use the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m_0 c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma.

Let me compute gamma:

v = 0.96c
v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2
1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (because 0.28^2 = 0.0784)
So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, right. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of Li-6. The nucleus is made of protons and neutrons.
