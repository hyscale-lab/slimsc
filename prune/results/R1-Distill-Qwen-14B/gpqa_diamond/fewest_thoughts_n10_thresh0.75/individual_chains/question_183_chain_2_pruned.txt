Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with numbers 1, 3, 5, 0. Hmm.

First, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated by the formula: Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But wait, in this case, the product might not have nitrogens or halogens, so maybe I don't need to worry about X and N.

Next, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like and what reaction it undergoes. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Breaking that down:

- The main ring is cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So that's one degree of unsaturation right there.
- The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO). At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the 5-vinyl group adds another double bond.

Wait, let me draw this structure mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene). The substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached. So the 5-vinyl group is CH2-CH2 connected to the ring? No, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent. So the 5 position has a CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, the structure is cyclohexene (3-en) with substituents at 2 and 5. 2-formyl is a carbonyl group (CHO) attached to C2. 5-vinyl is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-)
