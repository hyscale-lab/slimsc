Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about two organic chemistry reactions and the products formed. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

First, let's look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones and esters, I think. Hexan-3-one means there's a ketone group at position 3. So the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, so the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, numbering is from the end. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me draw it out. Hexane has six carbons. 3-one means the ketone is on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. But wait, wait, the actual structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3 (methoxy group)
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, maybe it's better to think of it as (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3-CH3? No, because hexan-3-one would have the ketone on the third carbon. So the full structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2
