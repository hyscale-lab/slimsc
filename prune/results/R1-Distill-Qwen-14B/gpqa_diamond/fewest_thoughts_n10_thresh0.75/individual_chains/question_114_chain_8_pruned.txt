Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents A and B from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when that reacts with NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. NaCN would provide the CN- nucleophile. In ketones, the carbonyl carbon is attacked, so the product would be a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

The cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with HCN or its salt, like NaCN, under certain conditions. I remember that adding HCN to a ketone gives a cyanohydrin, which involves the formation of an alcohol and a nitrile. Oh wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write down its structure. That would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, perhaps it's (CH2CN)(CH3)C(OH)CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's three carbons: the central C is connected to two CH3, an OH, and a CN. So the structure would be (CH3
