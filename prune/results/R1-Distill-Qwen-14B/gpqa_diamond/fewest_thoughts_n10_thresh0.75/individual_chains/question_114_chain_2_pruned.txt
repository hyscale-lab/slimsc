Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reagents A and B are used in the given reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, usually ketones don't react directly with NaCN because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile under normal conditions. Oh right, I think that's where H2SO3 comes in. Sulfuric acid, or maybe something else?

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Oh, wait! For the addition of CN- to ketones, you usually need a catalyst. I think I've heard that H2SO3 (sulfurous acid) is used, but maybe it's a different reagent. Alternatively, maybe it's H3O+? Because sometimes in such reactions, you protonate the carbonyl to make it more electrophilic. Oh, but in the presence of H3O+ (like an acid catalyst), the carbonyl becomes more reactive.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl group. So, butan-2-one has a methyl group on either side of the carbonyl. Adding CN would give a secondary alcohol nitrile? Or wait, after addition, it's a secondary alcohol next to the nitrile.

Wait, but no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons. So, the nitrile is on the second carbon, perhaps.

Wait, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (
