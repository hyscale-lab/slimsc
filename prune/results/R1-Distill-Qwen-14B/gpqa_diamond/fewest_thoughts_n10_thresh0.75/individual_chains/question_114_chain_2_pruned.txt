Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the given options. Let me break down each reaction step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, using reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN), I remember that under certain conditions, it can undergo a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically don't react with HCN or its salts at room temperature. Oh, right! The reaction of ketones with amines or other nucleophiles usually requires some sort of acid catalyst or specific conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a nitrile. Hmm. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding something to that to get a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, I think that when a ketone reacts with a Grignard reagent, you get an alcohol after acid work-up. But here, the reagent is NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

Oh wait, no—wait. I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The reaction of a ketone with NaCN. I think that in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps, HCN can add to the carbonyl. But wait, when you have a ketone like acetone reacting with HCN, it can undergo addition to form cyanohydrin. Oh, right! That's right. The cyanohydrin formation.

So the reaction of a ketone with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst (like H3O+) would form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound with both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group added to the carbonyl carbon. So for butan-2-one ( (CH3)2CO ), the addition would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me structure this.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is: CH2C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN, but here with a hydroxyl and methyl groups on the same carbon. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The formula would be CH2(C(OH)CN)(CH2CH3)? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but the key point is that it's a cyanohydrin formation.

So, for the first reaction, the reagent would be HCN with an acid catalyst. But wait, the starting reagents are NaCN and A. Oh, so perhaps A is H3O+ because NaCN in acidic conditions can provide the HCN. Wait, no. NaCN is a source of CN-; in acidic conditions (H3O+), it would protonate. So when you have a ketone and add NaCN along with acid, like H3O+ (A), the mechanism would be the acid catalyzed addition of HCN to the ketone, forming the cyanohydrin.

So for reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So reagent A is H3O+.

Now, moving on to reaction 2. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and reagent B (which is H2O) produces 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.

Ah, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions for this hydrolysis are either using H2O with HCl (acidic conditions) or under basic conditions like with H2O and NaOH, followed by acid work-up. But in this
