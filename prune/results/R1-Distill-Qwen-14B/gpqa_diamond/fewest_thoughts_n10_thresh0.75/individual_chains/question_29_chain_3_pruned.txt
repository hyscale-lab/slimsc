Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, and after sequencing, they found changes in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. So, the gene is responsible for synthesizing a compound that's bad for nutrition, so we want to mutate it in a way that stops the compound from being made. Probably disrupting the gene function.

Looking at the sequences they provided. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATG... and ends with TGA. The mutants are 1 to 4, each with a different change.

I remember that in DNA sequencing, the sequence is read from 5' to 3', and exons are the coding regions. So changes in the first exon could affect the protein structure.

The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein, so the gene codes for a protein. If the mutation disrupts the gene, the protein might not be functional anymore. So we need a mutation that leads to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Mutant 2
Option B: Mutant 3
Option C: Mutant 1
Option D: Mutant 4

Let me compare each mutant with the intact gene.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Hmm. Let's break it down. The first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

In Mutant 1, the sequence starts ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Wait, the first few bases:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so after ATG, the next three are TTC in Mutant 1, while the intact has TTT. So the third codon is CTG in intact?

Wait maybe I should write the sequences side by side.

Intact: positions 1-20 (approx)
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TTA TTA TGC TGT C...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CTC...

Wait, maybe I should look for where the change is.

Looking at the first few parts:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCT...

Mutant 1: ...TCTACGCT...

Wait, maybe I should line them up:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT

Mutant 1: TTC T
