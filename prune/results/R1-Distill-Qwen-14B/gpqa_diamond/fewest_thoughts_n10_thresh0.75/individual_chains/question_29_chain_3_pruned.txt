Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some gene mutation. Hmm, let's try to think through this. The question is about identifying which mutation would eliminate an anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the gene responsible for it.

So the intact gene has a certain sequence. The mutants have changes in the first exon area. I remember that exons are the coding regions of a gene, so any changes here could affect the protein product.

The goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, meaning the gene product (the anti-nutritional compound) isn't produced. So which of these mutations would do that?

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let me look at each one.

Intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Wait, comparing the intact to Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTTCTCGCT... and in Mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCT... So the third and fourth nucleotides change from TT to CT. Then CGCT becomes CGCT as well? Wait, maybe I should line them up:

Intact: positions 1-10 maybe? Let's see:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, the first part is ATG followed by TTT in intact, but in Mutant1, it's TTCTA. Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are. Let me count.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Looking at the start: Intact is ATGTTT, Mutant1 is ATGTT C T. Oh wait, the third and fourth nucleotides change. In intact, it's TT. In Mutant1, it's CT. So the third T becomes C? So the sequence is ATG followed by TCT... Hmm, that's a point mutation.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at the other mutants.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So in Mutant2, the change is from TTA to TAA in the same region. So somewhere, a T becomes A. Let me check.

Looking at the beginning again.

Intact: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, the intact gene has CGCT in the middle, but Mutant2 has AAGC? Let me see. So, for example, starting at the 5th position, maybe.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compare each mutant's changes.

The problem is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, so which one disrupts the gene's function. That could be a nonsense mutation (early stop codon) or a frameshift, but looking at the sequences, they all seem to be point mutations because the length is the same.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if any of the mutations introduce a stop codon early in the sequence. Because that would truncate the protein, possibly making it nonfunctional.

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA. In the given sequences,
