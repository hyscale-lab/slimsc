Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. Oh right, it's a molecule with multiple double bonds and branches. So probably it's a conjugated diene or something similar, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key is to find the enthalpy of formation, which I recall is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

The data provided includes enthalpy of atomization for carbon (1000 kJ/mol) and bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So, the approach here should be the Hess's Law method, where we calculate the energy change based on bond energies.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using the formula: 

ΔHf° = Σ [Bond energies of reactants] - Σ [Bond energies of products]

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, actually, the standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies by considering the bonds broken in the reactants (elements) and the bonds formed in the product (the compound). So the
