Okay, so I've got this question about transcription factors and mutations. Hmm, let me try to think through it.

Alright, the question says that there's a transcription factor subunit that's inactive until it gets a signal. When it's activated, it gets phosphorylated on serine residues in the transactivation domain. Then it dimerizes, moves into the nucleus, and helps with gene transcription.

So, there are two mutations mentioned. Mutation X is a missense mutation in the transactivation domain and is a recessive loss-of-function. That means that having one copy (heterozygous) wouldn't cause a problem because the other allele is normal. But if both alleles have X, then both are non-functional, so you get the loss of function.

Then there's mutation Y, which is a heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain. It's a dominant-negative mutation. Oh right, dominant-negative means that the mutated allele can interfere with the normal allele, even though the person is heterozygous. So, even with one good allele, the presence of Y can cause the protein not to work.

The question is, what's the molecular phenotype when mutation Y is present?

Let me break the process down. The transcription factor is inactive in its unphosphorylated state. Once phosphorylated, it can dimerize, go into the nucleus, and activate transcription.

So, the dimerization is probably a step where the two subunits come together. If Y is in the dimerization domain, then the mutated subunit might not be able to form dimers correctly. But since it's dominant-negative, the wild-type subunit might also be prevented from dimerizing.

Wait, because in a dominant-negative scenario, even if you have one wild-type and one mutant, the mutant interferes with the wild-type. So, when the mutant Y is present, the wild-type subunits (from the other allele) might not be able to form functional dimers either.

So, the mutant Y subunit can't dimerize properly, and it might prevent the wild-type from dimerizing as well. So, the cells would have problems in the dimerization step. Without dimerization, the transcription factor can't move to the nucleus and activate genes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Change of conformation and gain-of-function. Hmm, gain of function usually implies the protein is doing something it shouldn't. But since Y is dominant-negative, it's more likely causing a loss of function. So probably not A.

Option B: Protein degradation and loss of wild-type. Well, I don't think Y directly causes degradation. It's more about dimerization. Unless the mutant somehow affects stability, but the question doesn't mention that. So maybe not B.

Option C: Loss of dimerization and wild-type phenotype. No, because the mutant Y is causing the protein to not function. So the phenotype would be loss of function, not wild-type. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: Protein aggregation and loss-of-function. Aggregation could happen if the proteins can't dimerize correctly and start clumping. If they aggregate, they can't function, leading to loss of function. That sounds plausible.

Wait, why would it aggregate? If the dimerization domain is messed up, the mutant subunits might stick together in a way that doesn't form the proper dimers, maybe creating aggregates. These aggregates prevent the protein from moving into the nucleus, so transcription doesn't happen. So the phenotype would be loss of function.

So, the presence of mutation Y leads to the proteins not dimerizing properly, possibly aggregating, and thus not functioning. So the molecular phenotype would involve loss of function because the proteins can't form the necessary dimers.

Looking at the options, D says protein aggregation and loss-of-function. That seems right.

So, the answer should be D.


The question involves a transcription factor subunit that becomes active upon phosphorylation, dimerizes, and moves into the nucleus to facilitate gene transcription. Two mutations are described: a recessive loss-of-function mutation (X) in the transactivation domain and a dominant-negative mutation (Y) in the dimerization domain. The focus is on the molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y.

Mutation Y is heterozygous and dominant-negative, meaning the mutant subunit interferes with the function of the wild-type subunit. Since dimerization is a critical step for the transcription factor to activate gene transcription, the mutant Y subunit likely disrupts the ability of both the mutant and wild-type subunits to form functional dimers. This disruption can lead to protein aggregation, as the misfolded or improperly dimerized subunits may clump together. Aggregation prevents the transcription factor from functioning, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A gain-of-function phenotype is unlikely because mutation Y causes a loss of function due to its dominant-negative nature.
- **Option B**: Protein degradation is not explicitly mentioned in the question, and there is no indication that mutation Y directly causes degradation.
- **Option C**: A wild-type phenotype would require the transcription factor to function normally, which is inconsistent with the dominant-negative effect of mutation Y.
- **Option D**: Protein aggregation and loss-of-function align with the expected outcome of mutation Y, as improper dimerization can lead to aggregation and prevent the transcription factor from functioning.

Thus, the most likely molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss-of-function.

Answer: D
