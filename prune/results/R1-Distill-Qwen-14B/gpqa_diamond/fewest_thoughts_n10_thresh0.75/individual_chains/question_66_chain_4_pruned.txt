Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same for all observers, regardless of their constant velocity relative to each other. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time, so it's like the broader symmetry group of spacetime.

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory. I remember that effective theories are built by considering all possible interactions that are consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory. So in the Standard Model, the underlying theory has certain symmetries, and SMEFT must respect those because it's a low-energy approximation of it.

So what symmetries does the Standard Model have? Well, the Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations. It also has gauge symmetries, like SU(2) and U(1), but I'm not sure if those are relevant here. The question is about global symmetries, I think.

CP symmetry is another one. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric on its own because of things like the CKM matrix, but wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the original theory (SM) has a certain symmetry, SMEFT's operators must respect that.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries are "respected by all operators." So if the SM has a symmetry, then SMEFT should respect it. The SM has Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about CPT. The CPT theorem says that all theories that are Lorentz invariant must have CPT symmetry. So if the SM is Lorentz symmetric, it must obey CPT.

CP symmetry is a separate thing. The SM doesn't have CP symmetry, right? Because of the way the weak interactions work. So operators in SMEFT can include terms that violate CP. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry as a global symmetry, then SMEFT's operators don't have to respect it either. Wait, no. SMEFT includes all possible operators that respect the symmetries of the SM. So if the SM has a symmetry, SMEFT must include only operators that respect that symmetry.

Wait, the SM has CPT symmetry, because it's Lorentz invariant. And it has Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. But the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, because CP is violated in some interactions. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then operators in SMEFT don't have to preserve it either. Wait, no, the opposite. Since the SM lacks CP symmetry, the effective theory can include operators that violate CP. Or is it that the effective theory must respect the symmetries
