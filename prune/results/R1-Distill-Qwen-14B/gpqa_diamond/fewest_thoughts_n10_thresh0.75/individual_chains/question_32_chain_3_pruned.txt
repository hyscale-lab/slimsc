Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's Lithium-6 because Lithium usually has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons in total. So Li-6 has a mass number A=6.

I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we need to use the relativistic equations, not the classical ones. The key here is that the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so I definitely can't use Newtonian mechanics; I have to use special relativity.

The problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus. The energy in relativity is given by the total energy equation, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. The formula is E = γ * m₀c². But wait, I'm not sure if this is the kinetic energy or the total energy. Oh right, the question says "energy of the RHIC", so I think it's referring to the total energy, which includes both rest mass and kinetic energy.

First, I need to find the gamma factor (γ) for the given speed. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The speed given is 0.96c, so v=0.96c. Let me plug that in.

Calculating gamma:
v = 0.96c
v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (because 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that division. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28*3.5 is
