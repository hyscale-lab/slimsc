Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6. Got it.

So, the nucleus is Li-6. I need to calculate the energy required to accelerate it to 0.96 times the speed of light. I think this involves relativistic mechanics because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Okay, let's think about the steps involved. When dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is given by the equation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the formula.

Calculating gamma: Let's compute v squared. (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.2
