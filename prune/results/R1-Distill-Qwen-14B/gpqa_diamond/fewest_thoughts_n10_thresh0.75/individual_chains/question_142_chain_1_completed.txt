Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, a density matrix for a mixed state. Because each term is a projector, and they're being averaged with equal weights, this should represent a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position? I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a completely mixed state should be at the origin of the Bloch sphere, right?

Let me think. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz). So if the state is completely mixed, that would mean it's the maximally mixed state, which is (I)/2. Because then r·σ would be zero. So r would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. So the geometrical position in qubit space (which is the Bloch sphere) is at the origin. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute that. Since |0><0| is the projection operator, and |1><1| is the same for state 1. So adding them together and dividing by two, it's (I)/2 because |0><0| + |1><1| equals the identity matrix in 2x2 dimensions. So yes, that's the maximally mixed state, which corresponds to the origin in Bloch sphere terms. So the vector r is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For a maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero because there is no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere.

The given options are:
- A) \( r = (1,1,0) \)
- B) \( r = (0,0,1) \)
- C) \( r = (0,0,0) \)
- D) \( r = (1,1,1) \)

Since the maximally mixed state corresponds to \( r = (0,0,0) \), the correct answer is:

Answer: C
