Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But how does that translate into a geometrical position?

Oh right, when dealing with qubits, the state can be represented in a three-dimensional space. I think this is because a qubit can be described by a vector in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has three axes, usually labeled x, y, and z. The position on the sphere corresponds to the parameters of the qubit state.

Wait, the general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can rewrite the given ρ in this form, I can find out what r is.

Let me write out the given ρ. It's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I know that |0><0| is the projector onto the state |0>, and similarly for |1><1|. Let's compute each term.

|0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 at (2,2). So adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements as 1. Then multiplying by 1/2, the matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That's the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5.

But wait, the identity matrix is (I), so ρ = 0.5 * I. So in the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's set them equal.

0.5 I = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ.

Hmm, subtract I from both sides. Oh wait, that gives 0 = r·σ. So r·σ must be zero. That means the vector r is zero.

So in the Bloch sphere representation, the state is at the origin. Because r is (0,0,0), the point is at the center of the sphere, which represents the completely mixed state. Because when the qubit is in a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is ½ I, and its Bloch vector is zero.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, a general single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that 

\[
\frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that 

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0,
\]

which means the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space corresponds to the origin, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)** — Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)** — Incorrect, as this represents a different state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)** — Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)** — Incorrect, as this does not match the given density matrix.

Answer: C
