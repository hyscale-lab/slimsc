Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here, and I need to figure out the products. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? So the enolate ion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of another carbonyl compound.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. I think under basic conditions, like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), the malonate would deprotonate to form an enolate. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which would be the electrophilic part.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. When the malonate enolate attacks, it should add across the double bond. Let me imagine that: the enolate (with negative charge on the alpha carbon) would attack the beta position, which is the CH2 part. So the attack would happen on the CH2, adding the malonate group there.

Wait, but the acrylate has the structure (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-(C-OEt)(p-tolyl), right? So the double bond is between the two central carbons. So the enolate would attack the CH2 group. So the addition would lead to the malonate group attaching to that CH2, turning it into a CH with two more carbons attached.

So the product after attack would have the malonate's methyl groups attached. Let me try to draw this. The original acrylate is CH2=CH-C(OEt)-p-tolyl. After the attack, the CH2 becomes CH with two methyl groups (from malonate) attached. So the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)2-OEt-p-tolyl, but wait, that's not right because the double bond would shift. Oh, wait, no, the attack would break the double bond. So the product would have a single bond where the double bond was, and a new bond from the enolate.

Wait, the product would be something like the enolate attacking the beta carbon of the acrylate. After the attack, the double bond would shift. So the product would have the structure where the malonate is added to the beta position. So the product would be (CH2C(OEt)(p-tolyl)) connected to the malonate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2CH-CO-OEt, but no, wait, no. Dimethyl malonate is actually CH2(COOEt)2. So when it forms the enolate, it's CH2(-)â€“COOEt, but I think the enolate is the deprotonated form at the alpha position. So the enolate is CH
