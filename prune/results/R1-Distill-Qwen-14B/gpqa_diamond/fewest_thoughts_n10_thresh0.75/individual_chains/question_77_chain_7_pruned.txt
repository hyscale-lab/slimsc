Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement, and I need to figure out the major products. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, the question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. BuLi is a strong base, a good nucleophile. Wait, but in what context is BuLi used here? Oh, maybe it's for deprotonation or some kind of conjugate addition.

So the structure of the starting material: Let me draw it out. Benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me parse it. The substituent is an oxy group (like an ether) attached to a methyl group. So the structure is OCH2- attached to the benzene, and then the other part is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CHCH2CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on C3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, the numbering is from the end. Oh, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between 2 and 3? No, wait. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. Because the numbering starts at the end where the substituent is. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So it's OCH2 connected to the butenyl group. Let me write it as:

The
