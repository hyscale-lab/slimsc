Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, okay, let me write that out in matrix form because I think that will help visualize it. 

The |0⟩ state is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1 in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩ is [0; 1], so |1⟩⟨1| would have 1 in the bottom right. Adding them together and multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix would be:

[ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ]

So that's a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. 

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. Oh, right, I think qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices are a bit different because they're not just pure states. Pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are inside. 

But how do I represent a density matrix as a point in space? I remember something about the vector representation of a density matrix. Oh yeah, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (like the Bloch sphere) and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

So, if I have ρ in the form of I/2 plus something else, I can find r. Let me see. Our ρ is ( |0><0| + |1><1| ) / 2. Let's compute each component. 

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Our ρ is exactly that, which means the other term (r·σ)/2 must be zero. Because ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 →  (I +0)/2. 

So, (r·σ)/2 = 0 implies that r·σ = 0. The Pauli matrices σ are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, the product r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Each σ matrix is:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, if I compute r·σ, each term would be a matrix. Adding them together and multiplying by r_x, r_y, r_z respectively, then the sum should be a matrix that when multiplied by 1/2 gives zero. Because in our
