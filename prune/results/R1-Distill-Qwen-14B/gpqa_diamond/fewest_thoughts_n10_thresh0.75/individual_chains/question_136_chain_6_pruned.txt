Okay, so I have this problem here about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² radially from the origin. So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Oh right, so the vector field f(r) must be something like f(r) = (some constant) * r̂ / r². Wait, because in spherical coordinates, the radial unit vector is r̂, so yeah, f(r) is r̂ multiplied by 1/r².

Now, the question is asking about the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So, ∇ · f inside a sphere. Hmm, and we need to compute the integral ∫ (over the volume) ∇ · f dV.

Wait, I think I remember something called the Divergence Theorem. Oh right, that's the Gauss's theorem in vector calculus. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary surface. So mathematically, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n̂) dA, where n̂ is the outward normal vector to the surface.

In this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R, so the boundary is the surface of the sphere at radius R. And the normal vector on the surface is just r̂, the radial unit vector. So substituting, the surface integral becomes ∫∫ (f · r̂) dA over the sphere's surface.

But f is already in the radial direction, right? So f = (1/r²) r̂. On the surface of the sphere where r = R, f becomes (1/R²) r̂. So f · r̂ would just be 1/R². So the surface integral is ∫∫ (1/R²) dA. 

The dA in spherical coordinates for a sphere of radius R is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So plugging that in, the integral becomes ∫∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ. The R² cancels out, so it's
