Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm. Let's read it again.

So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, right, radius matters for luminosity. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but in the question, I see that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength due to black body radiation. Oh, Wien's Law maybe?

Then they mention the radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity. So I guess radial velocity might not directly affect the calculation here unless it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler effect is accounted for, or perhaps we don't need to consider it since the observed wavelengths are the same.

Wait, but the question says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so they're using the black body radiation formula. So I think Wien's displacement law applies here. Wien's law is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant and T is the temperature. Since the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because lambda_max is the same, so T1 = T2.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would shift due to Doppler effect. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is considered, but for the purpose of this problem, we can take the temperature as the same. Or maybe we don't have to because the question is about the actual emitted wavelengths, not the observed ones? Hmm, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So that's the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that would shift its peak wavelength.

Wait, but how does that play into this? Let me think. If Star_2
