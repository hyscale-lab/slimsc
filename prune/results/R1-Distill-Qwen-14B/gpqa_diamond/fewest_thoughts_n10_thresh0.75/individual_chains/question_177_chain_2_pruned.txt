Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Their masses are also in the same ratio, 1.5 times. But wait, the question is about their luminosities, so maybe their masses don't directly affect that. I remember that luminosity for stars is related to their radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity (L) is proportional to radius squared multiplied by temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴. So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4.

Hmm, but wait, the question doesn't mention temperatures directly. Oh, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I think that's about the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Oh yeah, Wien's law! Which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max ∝ 1/T. If the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so T1 = T2. So that means the temperature ratio is 1.

Wait, but wait, the question says the spectra showed the same peak wavelength. So both stars have the same T? Because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same, T1 = T2.

Wait, but then if the temperatures are the same and R1 is 1.5 R2, then the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1=T2, the (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make the ratio about 2.25, so option A is ~2.25. But wait, hold on. The problem also gives something about radial velocities. Oh right, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm
