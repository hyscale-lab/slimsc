Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy terms, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, the distance is smaller, and if plx decreases, the distance increases. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So distance d = 1/plx.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since we want this in terms of distance, let's substitute plx with 1/d.

Substituting, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/(plx)^5 is same as (d)^5, because plx is 1/d. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So I should think about the derivative of N with respect to d. Because it's the change per unit distance.

So if N = k * d^5 (where k is some constant), the derivative dN/dd would be k*5d^4. So the number of stars increases by a factor of 5d^4 per unit distance.

But wait, the options don't have a 5, but they do have options with different exponents. The question is about how the number changes with distance, so perhaps it's looking for the functional form. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number density, like stars per unit volume or something.

Wait, no, the question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps it's the number per unit distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance
