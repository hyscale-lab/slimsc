Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Let me think through this.

First, I need to draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means there's a double bond starting at carbon 1. So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no—wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, pent has five carbons. Oh, right, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene—so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, the formula for pentene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl branch on C3. So, structure is: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be six carbons because the chain is five. Wait, no, pentane is five carbons, so pent-1-ene is five carbons, double bond between C1 and C2. So, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon of the chain. Let me draw this:

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the main chain is five carbons, but with a methyl group on carbon 3.

Wait, maybe it's (CH2)2C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let's count. Pent-1-ene: 5 carbons, double bond at 1. So, positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be pent-1-ene. Then 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3.
