Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, right? It's used for olefin metathesis, which involves the redistribution of alkene fragments.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But for this reaction, maybe the stereochemistry doesn't matter as much as the structure.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. The chain is five carbons long. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(H)(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, I think I messed up. Let's count. Pent has five carbons.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: the double bond starts at C1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would mean there's a methyl branch on carbon 3. Wait, carbon 3 is the third carbon, so the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me number the carbons.

For pent-1-ene: positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But 3-methyl would add a methyl
