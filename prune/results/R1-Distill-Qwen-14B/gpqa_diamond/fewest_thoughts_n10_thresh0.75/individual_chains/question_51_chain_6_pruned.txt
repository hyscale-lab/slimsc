Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, what's the setup again? The sphere is conducting and grounded. Oh right, when a conductor is grounded, it means it's connected to the Earth, which is effectively at zero potential. So any charges induced on the sphere can move freely.

When you place a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface will get induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can actually leave the sphere. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. No, wait, when a conductor is grounded and you bring a charge near it, the induced charges redistribute. If the charge is positive, the sphere's near side will have induced negative charges and the far side positive, but since it's grounded, the positive charges can leave to the ground, leaving the sphere with a net negative charge. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If a positive charge is brought near, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the near side, making that side negative. The far side will be positive, but since it's grounded, the positive charges can flow away, leaving the sphere with a net negative charge. But wait, does the sphere end up with a net charge? Or does the grounding ensure that the sphere's potential is zero, hence any induced charges are such that the potential cancels out?

Wait,
