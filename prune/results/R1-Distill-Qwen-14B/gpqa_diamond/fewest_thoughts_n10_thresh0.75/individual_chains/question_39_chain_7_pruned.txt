Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. I remember that for wave functions, especially in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is given by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. Since the particle isn't found outside x<1 and x>3, that means the probability between x=1 and x=3 must be 1, right? Or wait, actually, the problem states that when measuring, none were found outside that range. Hmm, wait no, that can't be right. Because if the wave function is zero outside, that would make the probability zero. But the wave function given doesn't look like it's zero outside. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait the wave function is described as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's for a part of space where the particle can exist. But the measurements showed that all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function is zero outside of 1 and 3, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe that's only the part where the wave function is non-zero, i.e., between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, no. The problem says "each particle can move along a tube (the x-axis direction)" and the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But when they measured, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems to be a complex function, with a real part and an imaginary part. Hmm, but the wave function for a particle in a 1D box usually is real, or can be complex? Well, in quantum mechanics, wave functions can be complex, so that's okay.

Wait, the wave function's probability is |ψ(x)|². So the particle's
