Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I'm assuming that's a vector in a three-dimensional complex space because the matrices for the operators are 3x3. Wait, the elements are real numbers, that's fine too. So the state vector is probably [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let me just note that down.

The operators for the observables P and Q are given as square matrices. The first operator, P, has the elements: first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that looks a bit like a symmetric matrix. The operator Q has a diagonal matrix with entries (1, 0, -1). Oh, that's a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first and then Q. Wait, no, the question says measuring Q just after the measurement of P. Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. Wait, no, the question says: What is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. Wait, no, the sequence is that someone measures P first, then measures Q. So the measurement of Q is done after P. Or does it mean the measurement of P and then Q, and we want the probability of P being 0 and Q being -1?

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, no, I think the correct way is that the measurements are done in sequence: first P is measured, then after that, Q is measured. So the state is initially (-1, 2, 1), which I should probably normalize because right now the vector isn't normalized. Wait, is that necessary?

Wait, the state vector is given as [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The length squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) times that vector. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors. So I probably need to normalize it first. Let me do that. The state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the first measurement is of P. So I need to find the possible eigenvalues of P, and when P is measured, the system will collapse into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. Then, the state after measuring P (and getting a particular eigenvalue) will be used to measure Q.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So that would involve two steps.

But wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, then for each eigenvalue, compute the probability of getting that eigenvalue when measuring P, and then for that resulting state, compute the probability of getting -1 for Q.

Alternatively, if the measurement of P yields 0, then the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0. Then, from that state, measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

So to find the overall probability, it's the probability of P being 0 multiplied by the probability of Q being -1 given that P was 0.

So steps:

1. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.
2. For each eigenvalue of P, calculate the probability that the initial state collapses to that eigenvalue. Specifically, find the probability that P is measured to be 0.
3. Then, find the eigenvectors of Q for each eigenvalue, particularly for Q=-1. But wait, since Q is diagonal, its eigenvalues are 1,0,-1, and the eigenvectors are the basis vectors. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, Q is represented by the matrix:

[[1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, -1]]

So this is a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So for eigenvalue 1, eigenvector is [1, 0, 0]^T. For 0, it's [0, 1, 0]^T. For -1, it's [0, 0, 1]^T.

So when you have a state, the probability of measuring Q as -1 is the square of the absolute value of the third component of the state vector, assuming the state is normalized.

But wait, the state after P is measured to be 0 is the corresponding eigenvector. So I'll proceed.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Operator P's matrix is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve det(P - λ I) =0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[
[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ],
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]
]

The determinant is a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues by another method. Maybe by noticing symmetries or other properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P has some pattern. Let me see; perhaps it's a circulant matrix? Or perhaps it's a tridiagonal matrix?

Wait, looking at the structure, the non-zero elements are along the first superdiagonal and subdiagonal, and the center. Maybe it's a symmetric matrix.

Wait, the matrix is symmetric, so its eigenvalues will be real, and eigenvectors will be orthogonal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can guess some eigenvectors.

Let me try to find eigenvectors for P.

Suppose we have an eigenvector v = [a, b, c]^T. Then, P v = λ v.

So, compute P v:

First component: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*c = (b)/√2 = λ a.
Second component: (1/√2)*a + 0*b + (1/√2)*c = (a + c)/√2 = λ b.
Third component: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*c = (b)/√2 = λ c.

So from the first and third equations:

b/√2 = λ a → a = b/(λ√2)
b/√2 = λ c → c = b/(λ√2 )

So a = c.

Now, substitute into the second equation:

(a + c)/√2 = λ b.

But a = c, so 2a / √2 = λ b → (2a)/√2 = sqrt(2) a = λ b.

But a is b/(λ√2 ), so substitute:

sqrt(2) * [b/(λ√2 ) ] = λ b.

Simplify sqrt(2) * b/(λ sqrt(2)) ) = (1/λ ) b.

So (1/λ) b = λ b → 1/λ = λ → λ^2 =1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

Wait, but wait: that's only if b is not zero. Because we divided by b. So we need to consider the case where b=0.

Case 1: b ≠ 0 → leads to λ=±1.

Case 2: b =0 → then from first equation, b=0 → a and c are 0 from a = b/(λ√2 ), so a =0, c=0. So the vector is [0,0,0], which is trivial. So non-trivial solutions require b≠0, leading to λ=±1. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm missing another eigenvalue.

Wait, if the determinant equation is of third order, it must have three eigenvalues. So perhaps λ=0 is also an eigenvalue.

Wait, let me check whether λ=0 is a solution.

If λ=0,

From first equation: b/√2 = 0 → b=0.

Third equation: b/√2 =0 → again b=0.

Second equation: (a + c)/√2 =0 → a = -c.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where a=-c and b=0.

So the eigenvectors are all multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0.

So for P, the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0.

Now, for each eigenvalue, the eigenvectors are:

λ=1:

From earlier, λ=1.

So a = b/(1 * sqrt(2)) = b/sqrt(2)
c = b/sqrt(2)

And the second equation gives:

( a + c )/sqrt(2) = (2 b/sqrt(2)) ) / sqrt(2) ) = (2b)/(2) )= b.

Which equals λ b → 1*b. So equation holds.

So the eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form [ a, b, a ] where a = b/sqrt(2), so substituting, [ (b/sqrt(2)), b, (b/sqrt(2)) ].

We can choose b= sqrt(2), then the vector becomes [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T. But perhaps it's better to normalize it.

The length squared is 1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 =1 +2 +1=4. So the normalized vector is (1/2) [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Similarly, for λ=-1:

a = b/( -1 * sqrt(2) ) = -b/sqrt(2)
c= -b/sqrt(2)

Substituting into the second equation:

(a + c)/sqrt(2) = [ ( -b/sqrt(2) ) + ( -b/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2) = [ -2b/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2) = (-2b) / 2 ) = -b.

Which equals λ b → (-1) * b. So equation holds.

So the eigenvectors are [ -1, sqrt(2), -1 ]^T, but wait, let me see: if I choose b= sqrt(2), then a= (sqrt(2))/( -sqrt(2) )= -1, c= -1. So vector is [ -1, sqrt(2), -1 ]^T. Let's check normalization: (-1)^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 + (-1)^2=1 +2 +1=4. So normalize by 1/2: [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ]^T.

For λ=0, the eigenvectors are [1,0,-1]^T, which has length squared 1 +0 +1=2. So normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So to summarize, the eigenstates of P are:

For λ=1: (1/2) [1, sqrt(2), 1]
For λ=-1: (1/2) [ -1, sqrt(2), -1 ] — wait, no, because if we choose b= sqrt(2), then the vector is [ -1, sqrt(2), -1 ]^T. So normalized by 1/2, it's [ -1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2 ].

Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier when choosing b. Let me recast the eigenvectors properly.

Wait, for λ=1:

We have a = b/sqrt(2), c = b/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b, a ]

But any multiple is acceptable, so let me select b = 1.

Then a = 1/sqrt(2), c=1/sqrt(2).

So the vector is [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that the vector for λ=1 would be [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue by solving (P - λ I) v =0.

Let me take λ=1.

Matrix P - I is:

[
[-1, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), -1, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -1]
]

We need to solve (P-I) v =0.

So, for v = [a, b, c]^T, the equations are:

- a + (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 → a = (b)/sqrt(2)
(1/sqrt(2)) a - b + (1/sqrt(2)) c =0
(1/sqrt(2)) b - c =0 → c= (b)/sqrt(2)

So a = b/sqrt(2), c = b/sqrt(2)

So the vector is [ b/sqrt(2), b, b/sqrt(2) ].

We can choose b = sqrt(2) to make the first and third components 1.

Then, a = (sqrt(2))/sqrt(2) =1, c=1.

So the eigenvector is [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

The length squared is 1 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1=1+2+1=4. So normalized by 1/2.

So the normalized eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/2)[1, sqrt(2),1]^T.

Similarly, for λ=-1.

Matrix P - (-1) I = P + I:

Row 1: [1, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 1]

Set up the equations:

1*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b =0 → a = -b/(sqrt(2))
(1/sqrt(2)) a +1*b + (1/sqrt(2)) c=0
(1/sqrt(2)) b + 1*c =0 → c= -b/(sqrt(2))

So a = ( -b )/sqrt(2), c= (-b)/sqrt(2).

So the vector is [ -b/sqrt(2), b, -b/sqrt(2) ].

Choosing b=sqrt(2), we get [ -1, sqrt(2), -1 ]^T. The length squared is 1 +2 +1=4. So normalized to 1/2.

So the eigenvectors for λ=-1 are [ -1/(2), sqrt(2)/(2), -1/(2) ]^T.

And for λ=0, the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T, normalized to 1/sqrt(2) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So now, the state of the system is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

We want to find the probability of measuring P=0, which is the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

The eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the inner product between the initial state and this eigenvector will give the amplitude, whose square gives the probability.

Compute the inner product:

( -1/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) *0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(12)) ) ] + [ (-1) / (sqrt(12)) ) ]

= ( -2 ) / (2 * sqrt(3)) ) → since sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3)

= (-2)/(2√3) ) = -1/√3.

The amplitude is -1/√3. The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the system collapses into the eigenvector of P for λ=0, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, we measure Q. The observable Q has eigenvalues 1,0,-1, with eigenvectors [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1], respectively.

But our state after P=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]^T.

Wait, no, the state after P=0 is the eigenvector of P for λ=0, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T. So the state is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Now, to find the probability of measuring Q to be -1, we look at the third component of this state (since Q's eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the third basis vector).

The third component is (-1/sqrt(2)).

The amplitude is (-1/sqrt(2)), and the probability is its square, which is 1/2.

Wait, no: the square is (1/2), because (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the P=0 eigenstate, and then you measure Q. So the probability for Q=-1 is 1/2 in that scenario.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.


The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the vector is not normalized, we normalize it by dividing by its length, which is \(\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}\). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \(P\)
The operator \(P\) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). The eigenvalues are found to be \(\lambda = 1, -1, 0\). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \(\lambda = 1\): \(\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(\lambda = -1\): \(\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\),
- For \(\lambda = 0\): \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \(P = 0\)
The eigenvector corresponding to \(\lambda = 0\) is:

\[
v_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the initial state \(\psi\) and \(v_0\):

\[
\langle \psi | v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle \psi | v_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle \psi | v_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \(P = 0\)
If \(P = 0\) is measured, the system collapses into the eigenvector \(v_0\). The normalized state becomes:

\[
\psi' = v_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \(Q = -1\)
The operator \(Q\) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue \(-1\) corresponds to the eigenvector \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\). The probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) is the square of the absolute value of the third component of \(\psi'\):

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \psi'_3 \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined probability
The overall probability of measuring \(P = 0\) and \(Q = -1\) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
**D) \( \frac{1}{6} \)**
