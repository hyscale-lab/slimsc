Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I think I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something similar. But in this case, the nucleus is X, which is lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, so lithium has 3 protons normally, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons. Oh wait, so X is Li-6? Because Li usually has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass number would be 6.

So the problem is about finding the kinetic energy or the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. Wait, the question says the energy of the RHIC so the speed is 0.96c. So probably the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

In relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma for v=0.96c. So v is 0.96 times the speed of light. Let's plug that into the gamma equation.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

Computing (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96. Let me do that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So 1/0.28 is gamma. 1 / 0.28 equals approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Because 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1
