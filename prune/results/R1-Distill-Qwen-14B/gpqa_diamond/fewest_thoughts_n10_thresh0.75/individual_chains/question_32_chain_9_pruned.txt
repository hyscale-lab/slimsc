Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus in question is a Lithium nucleus with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that's a Lithium-6 isotope because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

I think I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. The options are given in GeV, so I need to calculate the energy in that unit.

First, I remember that relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m_0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Let me compute 1 - v²/c². v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784). 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which equals approximately 3.57142857. Hmm, or wait, is that right? Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is 3.57142857... yeah, that's correct.

But wait, maybe I should compute it exactly. Let me think: 0.28 is 7/25. So 1 / (7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma is 25/7 or approximately 3.5714.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus X. The nucleus is ^6Li, which has a mass number A=6. The mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons, but wait, actually, when considering a nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy, but for approximate calculations, we can use the atomic mass and then subtract the electrons.

But wait, the nucleus is a bare nucleus, right? So for a ^6Li nucleus, the atomic mass would be for ^6Li atom, which has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons, right? Because Li has atomic number 3, so 3 electrons.

Alternatively, the mass of the nucleus can be found using the atomic mass of ^6Li minus the mass of the electrons. But I'm not entirely sure about that, but perhaps for this problem, the mass is given or can be looked up. Wait, but I don't have a table here, so maybe I should use the formula for the relativistic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as approximately the same as the atomic mass taken as a whole, but I might be missing something. Wait, but the nucleus is moving, so its rest mass is the same as the rest mass of the atom, except without the electrons. Hmm, or wait, no. The rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons minus the binding energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives us the mass of the nucleus, but it's not provided, so maybe I should proceed with another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think. The energy of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m_rest * c².

So I need to find m_rest of the ^6Li nucleus. Alternatively, I can use the atomic mass of Lithium-6. Let me recall that the atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.016 atomic mass units (u). Wait, I'm not certain, but I think ^6Li has an atomic mass around 6.016 u. So, the rest mass energy would be m_rest * c², where m_rest is 6.016 u converted into kg, and then multiplied
