Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, looking at the interaction Lagrangian given.

The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, maybe I should parse this more carefully. Oh right, the interaction term probably looks something like L_int = -λ f ψ_f^† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). So that makes sense. Because the X field is interacting with the fermion fields ψ_f, which are probably Yukawa interactions.

So the boson X couples to fermions. The decay of X will be into fermion-antifermion pairs. The key here is to find which fermions X can decay into, based on their masses and the available energy.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Remember, when a boson decays, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. But also, for each fermion pair, each fermion must have a mass less than half of X's mass. Because each fermion would get some energy, but the minimum mass needed is when they are at rest (i.e., all energy goes into mass). So 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. Let me list the masses of known fermions:

Electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV.
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV.
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV.
Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV.
Down quark (d): ~0.0045 GeV.
Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV.
Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV.
Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV.
Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV.

Wait, so the fermions whose mass is ≤ 3 GeV? Let's see:

e: yes, well under.
μ: 0.105, yes.
τ: 1.777, yes.
u: yes.
d: yes.
s: yes.
c: 1.275, yes.
b: 4.13>3, so no.
t: way too big.

So the fermions that can be produced are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait. For each pair, the sum is 2m_f. So for each fermion, 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. So any fermion with m_f ≤3 GeV can be produced in pairs.

So, which of the fermion pairs are possible?

e+ e-: yes, because 2m_e <<6.

mu+ mu-: yes, 2m_mu ~0.21 <6.

tau+ tau-: 2m_tau ~3.554 GeV. Wait, wait, 2*1.777 ~3.554 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Similarly, u and d quarks: 2m_u and 2m_d are way under 6 GeV.

Same for s: 2m_s is about 0.19 GeV, which is way under.

c quarks: 2m_c ~2.55 GeV, which is under 6.

But the bottom quark is about 4.13 GeV. 2m_b is 8.26, which is larger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar.

So possible decay products are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u ubar
d dbar
s sbar
c cbar.

Wait, but wait, the options don't list all these. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but this includes b, which as I thought, 2m_b=8.26>6 GeV, so not allowed. So option A includes b, which is impossible. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that includes all the allowed fermions except the b and t, which aren't allowed. So B looks correct, because all the decay products have m_f less than 3 GeV. Let's see, the possible particles are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

But t is way too heavy (2m_t >>6 GeV), so t is not allowed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed, so D is wrong.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. That's correct.

Option D includes b, which is 4.13 per particle, so 8.26 for pair, which is more than 6 GeV. So D is wrong.

So the correct option is B. Let me see the options again.

Wait the options:

A) Includes b, which is not allowed.

B) Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

C) Includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. t is 173 GeV, so no.

D) Includes b, tau, etc. So same as A, but also includes mu and e.

So the correct answer is B? Yes, because the allowed fermions are all the ones with mass less than 3 GeV. So the possible decay channels are to all these pairs.
