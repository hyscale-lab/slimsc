Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should parse that. The interaction term seems to involve the fermion fields ψ_f and their adjoints, multiplied by (ῡ + X), where ŧ is probably a vacuum expectation value or something, and X is the boson field.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the possible decay channels of X at the lowest order. So, the boson X will decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the interaction term would mediate the creation and annihilation of fermions when the boson is involved.

Wait, the problem is about kinematical allowed decays. So, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, each must have mass less than or equal to half the parent's mass. But wait, for fermions, if they're massless, the condition is just that the sum of their masses is less than the parent's mass. But since we're talking about real fermions, their masses matter.

But wait, the fermions in the decay products would need to have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV, because X is 6 GeV. But also, each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV, since each is produced as a pair. Hmm, but wait that's not accurate. The combined mass of the pair has to be less than or equal to the mass of X. So for each fermion, its mass should be less than or equal to 3 GeV, because each fermion comes in a pair, so 2m_f ≤ m_X → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, if the fermions are massless, then the condition is automatically satisfied. But since in reality, fermions have masses, I need to consider their masses.

Let me think about the possible fermions. The known fermions are quarks and leptons. Quarks come in up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Leptons are electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. But neutrinos are very light, but in terms of decay products, they might not be significant here unless X can decay into neutrinos, but I think the problem is about fermions with significant masses.

Wait, but the interaction term is given. The Lagrangian is L = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the interaction term is λ f f X ψ_f ψ_f? Or maybe it's (ῡ + X) multiplied by ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the coupling.

The term looks like λ f f-bar X ψ_f ψ_f-bar, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the term is a Yukawa coupling type, where the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

So in general, the interaction would allow X to decay into any fermion-antifermion pair for which the coupling exists. So the question is, which fermion pairs can be produced when X decays, considering their masses and the coupling terms.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the possible fermions must satisfy 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So, let's list the fermion masses:

- Up quark: ~1.5 MeV (massless compared to 3 GeV)
- Down quark: ~3 MeV
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible mass.

Wait, so for each fermion pair, we have 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So, let's see which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV.

Charm quark: 1.27 GeV → 2*1.27=2.54 GeV ≤6 GeV. So charm quark pairs are allowed.

Bottom quark: 4.1 GeV →
