Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to find the energy, so I think I'll have to use some relativistic equations here.

Wait, let me break this down. First, I should figure out what the nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons because it's Li-7, right? But if it has 3 neutrons, that makes the total nucleons 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's a Lithium-6 nucleus. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, Li has atomic number 3. So the isotope would be Li-6 if it has 3 neutrons, because 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, I need to find the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often referred to, but sometimes the total energy is asked. Wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." So I think it's referring to the total energy because speed is connected to velocity, which is a factor in gamma, the Lorentz factor.

Right, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E_rest. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I should calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma for v=0.96c. So v =0.96c, so v squared is 0.9216 c squared. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, let me check that calculation. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.078
