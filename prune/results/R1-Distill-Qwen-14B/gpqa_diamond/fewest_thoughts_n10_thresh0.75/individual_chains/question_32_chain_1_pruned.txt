Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li with 3 neutrons... Wait, Li usually has 3 protons because it's lithium. So the atomic number is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 3 + 3 = 6. So it's carbon-6? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, Li is element 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope is Li-6. Or wait, no. Wait, Li has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons. So the isotope is Li-6. Or wait, no, wait. No, wait, no. Let me double-check. Lithium has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that's 3 +3=6, so the isotope is Li-6. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the problem is to find the energy of the RHIC when the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. So this is a relativistic problem. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's
