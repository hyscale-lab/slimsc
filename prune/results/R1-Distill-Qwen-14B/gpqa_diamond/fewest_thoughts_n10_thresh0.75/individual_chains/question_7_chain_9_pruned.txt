Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The process given is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. And the question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Hmm. I remember that when particles interact, their mean free path is important. The mean free path determines how far a particle can travel before interacting. If the mean free path is small compared to the size of the universe, the particles can't survive for long, so their lifetime is limited by this interaction.

So, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be determined by the probability of it interacting with CMB photons. The higher the energy of the gamma-ray, the more likely it is to interact, right? Because higher energy photons have higher chances of annihilating when they collide.

Wait, but the CMB has a low energy, around 1e-3 eV. So the gamma-rays we're considering are much higher energy. I think the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation depends on the energies of both photons involved. Oh right, the cross-section increases with the center-of-mass energy. The threshold for electron-positron pair production is when the combined energy is at least twice the rest mass energy of an electron, which is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, waitâ€”the problem here is for e+ e- production. So the threshold is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 * m_e c^2, which is 1.022 MeV. So any gamma-ray with energy above this would have a non-zero probability of annihilating when it hits a CMB photon.

But wait, the problem is about the gamma-ray's lifetime being limited by this process. So, the gamma-rays are energetic enough that they annihilate quickly via this process. So, the mean free path would be the distance they
