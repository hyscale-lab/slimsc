Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism has something to do with compounds being able to rotate plane-polarized light. Oh right, that's because of chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. And if a compound has enantiomers, it exhibits optical isomerism.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are 1,2,3,4, and the answer choices are combinations of these.

Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, the central bond is a single bond between the two benzene rings. If that's the case, the molecule can have two configurations: the rings can be in a cis or trans arrangement around the single bond. Oh, but wait, does that create a chiral center? Or maybe it's about the whole molecule's symmetry. Another thought: if the substituents are symmetrical, maybe the molecule is meso, so it won't have optical isomerism. Let me think about the structure. The substituents are on each benzene ring at 2 and 6 positions. If the two rings are connected in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical, perhaps the molecule is achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents create a plane of symmetry, there might not be a chiral center. Wait, but biphenyls can have E and Z isomerism if the substituents are in positions that allow rotation. Since the substituents are on each ring, it's more about the configuration around the single bond. But does that lead to optical isomerism or geometric isomerism (stereoisomerism)? I think in this case, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule could have enantiomers. Wait, but biphenyls with certain substituents can have axial chirality. Oh, right! Axial chirality occurs when the two aromatic rings are connected by a single bond, and the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. In this case, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a NO2 group at position 6. So each ring has two substituents. The central bond allows rotation, but perhaps if the substituents are arranged in a way that's not symmetrical, the molecule could be chiral. Wait, but if each ring has the same substituents, then maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has a COOCH3 and a NO2. So maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. Or wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, like if one ring has the NO2 in a certain position relative to the other, maybe it's not symmetrical
