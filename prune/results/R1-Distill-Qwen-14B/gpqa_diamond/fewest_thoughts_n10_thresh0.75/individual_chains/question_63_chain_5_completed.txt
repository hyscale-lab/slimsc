Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state. Let me try to think this through.

Alright, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, but it's in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule must transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, what's the next state? Oh right, it's the first excited state.

I think the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference between these two states. So, the energy of the photon should be equal to the energy of the first excited state minus the fundamental state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels probably involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so that would be the next state after the fundamental, which is the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether it's a pure vibrational transition or if rotation is involved. Maybe I should break it down into parts.

First, the molecule's vibrational energy levels. The vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state. The energy levels for vibration are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0 for fundamental). So the first excited vibrational state would be v=1.

But wait, the question doesn't specify whether the transition is purely vibrational or if rotation is considered. Oh, the problem says it's using the rotation-vibration model, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest state (v=0 and rotational quantum number J=0 maybe? Or perhaps J can be higher? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.)

Wait, no, the fundamental state is typically the state with the lowest energy, which would be v=0 and J=0, I think. But wait, the rotational states have energy levels too, given by E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. But for a rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized in J.

But the problem says the model is non-rigid, but I'm not sure how that affects things. Maybe the non-rigid rotor model considers bond length variation, but perhaps that's for the vibration part.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the vibrational ground state, but maybe also the rotational ground state.

Wait, the question is asking for the photon's momentum. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, the energy is absorbed, causing a transition. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state and the next state.

So the energy difference would be the energy of the next state (v=1, J=0?) minus the current state (v=0, J=0). Or perhaps, it's a transition to the next higher energy state, which could be just vibrational or rotational.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Which transition would provide the lower energy difference?

The vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = (1/2) ħω, because from v=0 to v=1, the energy increases by ħω/2 for each level step. Wait, no: for each vibrational quantum number increase by 1, the energy increases by ħω. Because E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω. So from v=0 to v=1, ΔE = ħω.

For rotational transitions, the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is (J=1: E_rot = (2) ħ²/(2I) ) minus (J=0: E_rot = 0). So ΔE_rot = ( (2) ħ² )/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Which one is smaller? Let's compare the two. Let's compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

Given that ω is 4e14 rad/s, and I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length (2 angstroms).

First, calculate μ. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) amu. 20*2 is 40, 40/22 is about 1.818 amu. But I need to convert this into kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.018. So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, wait wait. Let me double-check that calculation: 20 amu and 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

So I = μ * r². r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = 1.818e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 1.818e-27 * 4e-20 = 7.272e-47 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) ? Wait, no, the rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So from J=0 to J=1, the change is (2ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, no. E_rot for J is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is (2 * ħ²)/(2I) ) = (ħ²)/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Compute that: ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (J^2 s^2).

I is 7.272e-47 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (7.272e-47) ≈ (1.112 / 7.272) * 1e-21 ≈ 0.1528e-21 J. So about 1.528e-22 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is ħω. Let's calculate that.

ħω = 1.05457e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

So the vibrational transition requires higher energy than the rotational one. So the molecule can transition either via a rotational or vibrational change. But since we're looking for the photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, that would be the rotational transition, because it's lower in energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but what's the next state? The 'next' state with the lowest possible energy would be the lowest energy state that's higher than the current state. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase.

So between the two options (rotational and vibrational), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition energy.

Wait, but wait. The current state is the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=0, J=1 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition has a lower energy, the photon's energy should be that of the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon needed is ΔE_rot = (ħ²)/(I).

So that's what I calculated earlier as 1.528e-22 J.

Wait, but the options are in momentum. Because the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because the photon's energy is related to its momentum via E = pc, since for photons, E = pc.

So p = E / c.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (1.528e-22 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 5.09e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's much smaller than any of the options given. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should think again. Maybe the transition is a combined rotational and vibrational one. Or perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as having J=0 and v=0, and the next state is when J increases by 1 (J=1, v=0). Because that would be the next lowest energy state.

Wait, but why did I calculate a momentum in the 1e-31 range when the options are 1e-27? Oh, that's a big discrepancy. Maybe I messed up the calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate the rotational energy difference. Maybe I made a mistake there.

Let me recalculate I first.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ =1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.018e-27 kg? Wait, no, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 is about 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, no, 1.818 * 1.6605 is 3.018, yes. So μ = 3.018e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Wait, earlier I had 7.272e-47 kg m², which is 0.7272e-46. So now I have 1.2072e-46 kg m². Hmm, why the discrepancy? Because I think I miscalculated earlier. Let's recompute.

Earlier, I had I = 1.818e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 2e-10 squared is 4e-20 m². So 1.818e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 7.272e-47 kg m². Oh, that's correct. So why in this second calculation I get 1.2e-46? Because I'm using μ as 3e-27 kg, which is wrong. Oh wait, no, wait: 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute:

1 * 1.6605 is 1.6605.

0.8 * 1.6605 is 1.3284.

0.018 * 1.6605 is approximately 0.02989.

Adding them up: 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889 + 0.02989 ≈ 3.0188.

So μ is 3.0188e-27 kg.

So I = μ * r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Wait, so I was wrong earlier; I think that's the correct I.

Wait, but earlier I thought I was 7.27e-47 kg m², but that's when μ was 1.818e-27 kg. So I must have made a mistake in which μ value I used. So which is correct?

Ah, I think I messed up. Let's clarify:

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2) /22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Each amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

So yes, μ = 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ * r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Now, ΔE_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) ?

Wait, earlier I thought the rotational energy for J transitions is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2072e-46) J.

Compute that:

(1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.112e-68) 

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2072) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the energy of the photon needs to match this ΔE_rot. So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

But the problem asks for the momentum of the photon. Since for a photon, E = pc, so p = E / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's even smaller than before. This can't be right because none of the options are this small. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the transition isn't purely a rotational or vibrational transition but a combination? Or perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a vibrational one, and I should calculate that.

Wait, let's compute the vibrational transition's energy and see.

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. So that's matching option D.

But wait, why was the rotational transition giving me a much smaller momentum? Because when I calculated the rotational transition, I got a momentum of about 3e-31 N·s, which isn't even close to the options.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

μ is (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ * r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then, ΔE_rot = (ħ²) / (2I) ?

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The formula for rotational energy is E_rot = [J(J+1)ħ²]/(2I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is [2 ħ²/(2I)] = ħ²/(I).

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly. For J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is [1(2) ħ²]/(2I) )= (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I.

So the change is ħ²/I.

So ΔE_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46) J.

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.10e-68 (exact is 1.112e-68).

So 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So p = E/c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are much larger. So why is this?

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't transition to a higher rotational state from the fundamental state because in the fundamental state, J can be higher. Or perhaps the model assumes that only vibrational transitions are considered here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational one. The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and the next state is the lowest possible in energy. Wait, the vibrational transition requires higher energy than the rotational, but the molecule might not have lower energy transitions available.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest state, so the next state must have higher energy, whether it's rotational or vibrational. So between the two, the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the photon needed would have less energy. So why are the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. What if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but in the rotational state J=0. The next state could be J=1, which is lower in energy than transitioning to v=1, J=0.

Wait, but earlier calculations show that the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. So the photon's momentum would be 3e-31 N·s, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is asking about a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the vibrational transition, and the rotational transitions are not allowed or are being neglected.

Wait, another approach: in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So the total energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0), or a higher rotational state (v=0, J=1), whichever has lower energy.

So which of the two transitions (v=0→v=1 or J=0→J=1) requires less energy?

Earlier, I calculated ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J and ΔE_vib ≈4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have energy E = ΔE_rot, leading to p = E/c ≈3e-31 N·s, which isn't an option.

But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range, which is much larger. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the energy of the photon is the sum of both vibrational and rotational contributions. Or perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=0, J=1), which is the next state in energy. So the energy difference is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference again.

I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let's compute ħ²/(I) accurately.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68.

1.0545718 squared is approximately 1.112.

So ħ² ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.207e-46 kg·m².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So p = E_photon / c = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Again, this is way smaller than any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational transition. Let's try that.

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 N·s. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. So that's matching.

But why did the rotational transition give a much smaller momentum? Because the rotational transition requires less energy. So why isn't that the answer?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state which is v=0, but J can be any number, but the fundamental state is the lowest possible, which is J=0. So the next state is J=1, which is the next higher rotational state.

So the photon's energy would be ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈9.2e-23 J, leading to p ≈3e-31 N·s. But this isn't an option.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0). Because that's a higher energy than the rotational state, but perhaps that's the next state after the fundamental state in the model.

But why would the next state in energy be the vibrational one when the rotational transition requires less energy? That doesn't make sense. The rotational transition would be a lower energy change.

Wait, perhaps the model being used doesn't include rotational transitions, only vibrational. Or perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions, which would explain why the answer is option D.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

r = 2e-10 m.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) amu = 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ * r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46 = appr 9.21e-23 J.

p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But that's way smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the rotational energy again.

The energy levels are E_rot = [ J (J + 1) ħ² ] / (2I).

So, for J=0, E_rot = 0.

For J=1, E_rot = [ 2 ħ² ] / (2I) )= ħ² / I.

So the energy difference is ħ²/(I), yes. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed, and the next possible transition is the vibrational one. So the photon's momentum would be option D.

But why would the rotational transition not be allowed? In reality, rotational transitions are typically dipole forbidden unless the molecule has a permanent dipole moment. However, the question doesn't specify any selection rules, so perhaps it's assumed that any transition is allowed.

But in reality, for diatomic molecules, pure rotational transitions are not allowed by the selection rules unless the molecule has a permanent dipole moment, which diatomic molecules usually do. So perhaps rotational transitions are allowed, but why isn't that matching the options?

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

If I calculate the vibrational transition's momentum as 1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

But why would the rotational transition not be the next state? Because perhaps the molecule is in a state where the rotational quantum number can't increase (like being in the highest possible rotational state), but that doesn't make sense with the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the combined rotational and vibrational levels. Like, the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon of energy ħω.

In that case, p = (ħω)/c = (1.05e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (4.2e-20) /3e8 = 1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Maybe because the question is about the vibration model, but the model includes both. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering vibrational transitions.

Given that the problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, I think the possible transitions are either rotational or vibrational. But the next state with the lowest energy is the rotational transition, which my calculation says, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, not considering rotation. So in that case, the answer would be D.

But why would the next state be the next vibrational state if the rotational transition requires less energy?

Perhaps the problem is looking for the vibrational transition because that's the 'next state' in terms of the model, regardless of the actual energy. Or perhaps the question is considering the first transition to a higher vibrational state, regardless of rotational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering only vibrational transitions.

In that case, the photon's energy is ħω = 1.05e-34 *4e14 =4.2e-20 J, and momentum is 4.2e-20 /3e8 =1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

Hmm.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
   \[
   I = \mu \cdot r^2 = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

4. **Rotational Energy Difference**:
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I}.
   \]
   For \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \), the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Vibrational Energy Difference**:
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega.
   \]
   The energy difference for \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar\omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Photon Momentum**:
   For a photon, \( E = pc \), so \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
     This is much smaller than the given options.

   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition, but the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( p_{\text{rot}} \)) does not match any of the provided options. The vibrational transition, on the other hand, gives a momentum of approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \), which matches **option D**. Therefore, the problem likely assumes the vibrational transition as the relevant process.
