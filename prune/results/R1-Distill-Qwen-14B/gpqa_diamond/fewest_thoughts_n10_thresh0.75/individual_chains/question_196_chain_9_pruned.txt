Okay, so I have this physics problem about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in this oscillator. The system obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, and has mass m with maximum amplitude A. And we're considering relativistic effects because the speed of light c is given, which hints that maybe we need to use special relativity here.

Wait, right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a classical oscillator, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). But since this is relativistic, that formula probably isn't directly applicable. Relativity would come into play when speeds approach c, but I'm not sure exactly how that affects the maximum speed here.

In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the oscillator's energy isn't just kinetic; it's a combination of potential and kinetic, oscillating as the mass moves.

In the case of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't the same as in the classical case. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, is this a quantum harmonic oscillator or classical? The question says "consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator" but doesn't specify. Hmm. Well, since it's asking about maximum speed, maybe it's a classical consideration.

Wait, but the options include terms with
