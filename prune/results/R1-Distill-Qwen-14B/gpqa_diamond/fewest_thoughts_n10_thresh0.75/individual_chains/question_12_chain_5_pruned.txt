Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me read it again.

The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The options given are A, B, C, D with different kinetic energy pairs for the products.

Hmm. So, Pi is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. In such cases, energy and momentum must be conserved, but since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they're neutral and have very small (almost zero) mass. Wait, no, in this case, the neutrino is the product of the decay. The Pi is a charged pion, so when it decays, it produces a muon and a neutrino. But wait, actually, the decay products for a charged pion are a lepton (muon or electron) and a corresponding antineutrino. Wait, but in this problem, it's written as Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. So, I think in this case, the neutrino is actually an antineutrino, but maybe the problem is simplified. Anyway, the mass of the neutrino is considered negligible compared to the muon's mass. So perhaps we can approximate the neutrino as massless.

So, the mass of the neutrino is approximately zero. But wait, in reality, neutrinos have mass, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can treat it as massless because the muon's mass is much larger.

Now, the initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's at rest. So, initial energy E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

In the decay products, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy is gamma * m_mu c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero (approximated), so E_nu = p_nu c.

Since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. So, p_mu = p_nu. Because the neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu c. For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). 

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.

But since energy is conserved, this total energy must equal the initial energy of the pion: 139.6 MeV.

So, the equation we have is:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6

Wait, units here. Since everything is in MeV, and c^2 is in (MeV/(mass))^2, but perhaps it's easier to treat the terms without worrying about the units because they are consistent. Alternatively, we can square both sides to solve for p.

Let me denote x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

= 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 *x + x^2

So, subtract x^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x

Compute the squares:

105.7^2: Let's calculate that. 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and 2*105*0.7 = 147. So, (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49 = 11172.49. So 105.7^2 is approximately 11172.49 (MeV)^2.

139.6^2: Let's compute that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139^2 is 19321. So, 139.6 is 139 +0.6. So, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab +b^2.

a=139, b=0.6.

a²=19321, 2ab=2*139*0.6= 166.8, b²=0.36.

So, 139.6^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 (MeV)^2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x

Rearranging,

2 *139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let's subtract:

19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67

Solve for x: x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. Let me see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 279.2 * 30=8376.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.66 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is higher than 8315.67. So the value would be slightly less than 30.

So,

30 is 8376, which is 60.33 higher than 8315.67.

So, 8315.67 = 279.2 * x → x ≈ (30 * 279.2) - (60.33) → no, perhaps better to compute as:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute:

279.2 * 29.7 = ?

29 * 279.2 = 27
