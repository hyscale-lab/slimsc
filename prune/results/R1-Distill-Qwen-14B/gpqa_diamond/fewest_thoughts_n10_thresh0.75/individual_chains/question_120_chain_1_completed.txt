Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars is the same in all regions. But wait, in three-dimensional space, uniform distribution implies that the number density is constant. So the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere.

I think I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like a slice in parallax) changes with the parallax value. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and it's a measure of distance. The formula I remember is distance d ≈ 1 / plx, but I should probably check the exact relation. Oh right, in parsecs, if plx is in arcseconds, then d (in parsecs) is 1/plx. So plx = 1/d.

Now, considering a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so maybe it's the number of stars with parallaxes in a small interval dplx around plx.

So I need to find the number of stars in a thin shell corresponding to a parallax around plx. Let's think in terms of volume. Each shell at distance d with thickness dd has a volume of 4πd² dd. Because it's a sphere, and the surface area is 4πd², multiplied by the thickness dd.

But wait, since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So number of stars N in shell d to d+dd is N = n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But since plx is 1/d, let's express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx, and dd = -d(plx) / d plx * d plx. Wait, let's compute dd in terms of d plx.

Differentiating d = 1/plx. So dd/d plx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases. So maybe I should be careful about the direction. But for the number of stars, I think we can just take the absolute value.

So substituting back into N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, wait: d =1/plx, so d^2 is (1/plx)^2. Then dd is (1/plx²) d plx but with a negative sign, but since we're considering a slice, the thickness is positive. Maybe I should think about the differential.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

The volume element for a spherical shell is 4π d² dd.

But since we're considering a change in plx, let's express this in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So substituting into the volume element:

4π * (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the number of stars in a small plx interval, it's the absolute value. So the volume element becomes 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx.

Wait, that would be 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx? No wait, because dd is (1/plx²) d plx. So the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, wait, no. Let me redo this.

d = 1/plx, so to express the volume element in terms of plx, I have:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - (1/plx²) d plx ]

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. So perhaps for the purposes of counting stars, we can take the absolute value.

So dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) d plx → 4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Because 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number of stars in that shell (dV) would be n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So the number per unit plx is (n * 4π (1/plx^4 )) * d plx / d plx, which is n *4π (1/plx^4 ).

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that doesn't sound right. Because as plx increases (d decreases), the volume per unit plx should be less, but 1/plx^4 is a much steeper decline.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go through it again.

The volume element for a shell at distance d is 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, then dd = ( -1/(plx^2) ) d plx.

So substituting:

dV = 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( -1/(plx^2) ) d plx )

Which is 4π (1/plx^4) * (-d plx )

But since we're looking at the absolute value, the volume element is 4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

So the number of stars in this volume is N = n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

Thus, the number per unit plx is (n *4π (1/plx^4 )).

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's the answer.

But wait, why would the number per unit plx drop so rapidly? Because as plx increases, the stars are further away, and each increase in plx corresponds to a much larger volume. So for each unit increase in plx, the volume increases as 1/plx^4, so the number of stars per unit plx would decrease as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another approach: think about the number of stars in a slice of parallax width d plx. Since the distribution is uniform, the number per volume is n. So the volume per unit plx is 4π (d)^2 (dd), but in terms of plx, it's 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 d plx ), but again, it's 1/plx^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it in terms of distance. The number of stars per unit distance d is proportional to the surface area at that distance, which is 4π d². But when you change the distance by dd, the number of stars is proportional to 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

So substituting, the number of stars in that dd is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx ) → again 4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. The problem assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we express the volume element in terms of parallax:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( n \cdot dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \propto n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to option A.
