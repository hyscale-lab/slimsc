Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they usually turn into other particles. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. Wait, but wait, the neutrino is a different story. I think neutrinos are very light, almost massless. But I'm not entirely sure about that. In particle physics, sometimes neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass compared to other particles. So, I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's mass is zero.

So, the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Because the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in units where c=1, E = p for the neutrino. 

The problem is about finding the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, in the options, it's giving two numbers which I think correspond
