Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the answer choices are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the volumes. Oh wait, right, dilution.

So, acetic acid is CH3COOH, and it's a weak acid. When you dilute it, the concentration decreases, which affects the pH. But wait, when we titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid to form acetate ions (CH3COO⁻) and water.

Let me write down the reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na+ + H2O.

So, the first step is to find out the initial concentrations after dilution, and then figure out what happens during titration.

Wait, when we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be (volume1 × concentration1) / total volume. So (20 × 0.05) / 40. Let me calculate that. 20 × 0.05 is 1 mmol. So 1 mmol in 40 cm³ is 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So, for the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. Let's calculate how much NaOH is needed for that.

Moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: Volume (L) × concentration (M) = 0.04 L × 0.025 M = 0.001 mol. So, to reach equivalence, we need 0.001 mol of NaOH.

But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. So the volume needed would be (moles)/(concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So, at equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

Wait, wait, 25% of what? Oh, I think it's 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, for the 25% titration point: we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution.

But wait, let me clarify: when you titrate, you add the base to the acid. So the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and adding 2.5 cm³ makes the total volume 42.5 cm³. Hmm, but maybe when the volumes are small, the difference is negligible, but perhaps for precise calculations, we should consider it.

But perhaps for this problem, the volumes are considered additive, so the total volume is 40 + 25% of 10 (which is 2.5) → 42.5 cm³. But maybe it's easier to calculate moles directly without worrying about the volume each time.

So, at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol. Since acetic acid and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted would be 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution was 0.001 mol. So, after adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO⁻) formed are 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait, the total volume after adding NaOH is important for calculating concentrations. So, the total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L. Let's compute that: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

The concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

Wait, what's the pKa? The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) → let's compute that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Hmm, so approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 as the first value. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, wait another thing: the volumes. When we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of solution, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³, as I thought. So the concentrations are correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: when you add a strong base to a weak acid, the base will deprotonate some of the acid. So the calculation is correct.

So at 25% titration, pH ≈4.26. Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base; so the solution will be basic.

So, the concentration of acetate ions will be determined by the moles of acetate divided by the total volume.

Wait, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid is converted to acetate). The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence, which is 10 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³, or 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But wait, acetate is a weak base, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw = Ka × Kb → Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, the Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, since the concentration is 0.02 M, we can set up an ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO⁻] = 0.02 M, [CH3COOH] = 0, [OH⁻] = 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small).

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 × 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29e-6 M. Then, pOH = -log(3.29e-6).

Log(3.29) ≈ 0.517 → log(3.29e-6) is 0.517 -6 → -5.483. So pOH is 5.483. Then pH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517, approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is around 8.52.

Looking back at the options: option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that's our choice.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option D) 4.57; 6.92

Wait, another thought: when you reach equivalence, the solution is acetate in water, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the volume.

Wait, initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH, so total volume is 50 cm³. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, as calculated.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Then the Kb is correct, and the calculation follows.

So, yes, equivalence pH is about 8.52.

So the correct option should be A, with pH at 25% titration 4.26 and equivalence pH 8.52.

Wait, but in the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration part.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculations. Let me double-check the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, which is 0.0025 L × 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of NaOH = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.04 L × 0.025 M = 0.001 mol.

So, after reaction, moles of acetic acid = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

So [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256 ≈4.26. So that part is correct.

So yes, the pH at 25% is around 4.26, and equivalence point is around 8.52. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Initial moles}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \times 0.05 \, \text{M}}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume of NaOH is added. The equivalence point requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated from the moles of acetic acid, \(0.001 \, \text{mol}\), divided by the NaOH concentration, \(0.1 \, \text{M}\)). Thus, 25% of the equivalence point volume is \(2.50 \, \text{cm}^3\) of NaOH.

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume after adding NaOH is \(40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}\). The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, \(0.001 \, \text{mol}\). The total volume is \(40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}\). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for acetate is calculated from \(K_w = K_a \cdot K_b\), where \(K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}\) and \(K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5}\):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, \(K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-]}\), where \(x = [\text{OH}^-]\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.0200) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately \(4.26\), and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately \(8.52\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
