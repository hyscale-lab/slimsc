Okay, so I have a multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a procedure used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It helps make the theory finite and manageable. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have other properties.

So, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Strings are one-dimensional objects, and they vibrate at different frequencies. From what I've heard, string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences as in other QFTs. Because of this, maybe they don't require regularization. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Or do they use it in certain contexts?

Option B: QCD. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. Because of this, perturbative methods work well at high energies. But wait, does that mean it doesn't need regularization? No, because I think QCD calculations can still have divergences, so regularization is needed. Or maybe because it's asymptotically free, it's more manageable, but regularization is still a part of the process. Or perhaps I'm mixing up things.

Option C: QED. Quantum Electrodynamics is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED is a renormalizable theory, which means it can handle divergences by absorbing them into physical parameters like mass and charge. But does it require regularization? Regularization is a step in the renormalization process. So yes, I think QED does require regularization to deal with loop diagrams and their divergent integrals. So C would require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. In classical theories, you don't have the same issues with infinities that come from quantum fluctuations.
