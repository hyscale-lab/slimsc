Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. So the idea is that these infinities are a sign that you need to handle the theory more carefully, maybe using renormalization.

So which of these theories don't need regularization? Let me go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? Like Maxwell's equations. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the same divergences that quantum theories do. In classical E&M, you don't have issues like electron self-energy because you're not quantizing the fields. So I think classical theories inherently don't require regularization because they don't have the same renormalization problems as their quantum counterparts.

But wait, what about the others. Option C is QED. I'm pretty sure QED needs regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. That's why renormalization was developed in the first place. QED loops lead to things like the Casimir effect and the need for counterterms. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD deals with
