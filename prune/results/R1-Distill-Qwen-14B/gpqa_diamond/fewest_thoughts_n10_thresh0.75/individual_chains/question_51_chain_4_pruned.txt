Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, right, I remember that conducting spheres have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and potentials.

So, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, what do I know about the potential energy in such a configuration? Oh right, when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor will respond by redistributing its charges. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will be able to flow in or out until the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground's potential, which is typically considered zero.

So, the charge q will induce charges on the sphere. Because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will reside on its surface. For a conducting sphere, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. And because the sphere is grounded, this potential is zero.

Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere. So, I think the sphere's induced charges would be such that the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges is zero on the sphere's surface. Or wait, maybe the sphere's potential is zero, so the sum of potentials from q and the induced charges must be zero.

Alternatively, I remember that the method of images could be useful here. But I'm not entirely sure, because that's usually for problems involving point charges and conductors. The method of images replaces the conductor with an image charge such that the potential is maintained correctly.

Hmm, but wait, in this case, the sphere is grounded, which complicates things. Because being grounded means the sphere's potential is zero. So any induced charges must adjust themselves such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Let me think about it more carefully. The conducting sphere has radius R, and the charge q is placed at a distance d from its center. The sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. 

When a charge q is placed near the sphere, the conductor will have induced charges. The induced charges on the sphere will consist of a charge -q_image such that the potential due to the charge q and this induced charge at the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, maybe I should consider the potential at the surface of the
