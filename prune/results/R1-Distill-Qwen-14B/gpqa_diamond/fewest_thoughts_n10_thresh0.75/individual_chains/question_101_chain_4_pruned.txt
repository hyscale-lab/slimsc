Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

First, I should probably think about the reaction type. The product looks like it's a substituted pyrrolidine. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a five-membered amine ring with a methyl group on the third carbon. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the first carbon. Hmm, cyclohexylidenemethyl sounds like a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (like a carbocation adjacent to a cyclohexene ring? Or maybe an exocyclic double bond? I'm not entirely sure.)

Wait, let me draw the structures mentally. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl is on the third carbon, so that's one of the non-adjacent carbons to the nitrogen. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, meaning the first carbon (the one adjacent to the nitrogen) has a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene group attached via a methyl. So, the structure is like, pyrrolidine with a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexene ring, perhaps.

I'm trying to think what reaction would form this. Since the question says it's acid-catalyzed, maybe it's some kind of alkylation or addition reaction. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. Under acidic conditions, amines can form carbocations. Oh, wait, but amines are generally not great at forming carbocations unless they're under strong acid and heat. But wait, if the amine is protonated, maybe it can form a carbocation. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or a ring-expanding reaction. Wait, there's another possibility: the product has a cyclohexene group connected via a methylene. Oh! Could this be an example of a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, because Friedel-Crafts is for arenes, but the ring here is a pyrrolidine, which is a five-membered amine ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening followed by some kind of cyclization.

Wait, maybe it's an example of a conjugate addition or some addition to a carbonyl. Wait, if the starting material 3-methylpyrrolidine is reacting with an aldehyde, perhaps via a condensation reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation.

Wait, another approach: the product has the cyclohexylidene group attached as a methylene. So the substituent is -CH2-cyclohexene. So, perhaps the reaction is adding a cyclohexene ring to the pyrrolidine ring via a methylene bridge.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting material is part of a ring-opening of
