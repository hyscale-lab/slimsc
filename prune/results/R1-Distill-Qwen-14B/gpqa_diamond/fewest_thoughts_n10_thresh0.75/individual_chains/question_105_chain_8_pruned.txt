Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think about what each part means.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere of it has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness changes. So, they're asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same signal in the light curve as the spots do. The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Hmm. So I think this is about the change in brightness, or the dip in brightness when a planet transits in front of the star. The same method used for detecting exoplanets via the transit method. But in this case, the spots are causing a similar effect. So the idea is to calculate the relative radius of the planet that would cause the same depth in the light curve.

Wait, but wait. The problem says, "to produce the same amplitude signal... if the star was not covered by spots." So the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots should be the same as that from a planet transit. So I need to find Rpl / Rstar where Rpl is the planet's radius, such that the dip in brightness (the transit depth) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

But wait, the spots are causing a decrease in brightness, but the planet would cause a similar decrease when it transits. So the question is about equating the two brightness variations.

So first, I should figure out what the brightness variation caused by the spots is. Then, find the planet radius that would cause the same variation when it transits.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works for the spots. When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. The spots are cooler, so they contribute less light. The overall brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR²σTeff^4. When spots are present, the total flux is reduced by the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux between the spot and the rest of the star.

Wait, but the problem says the filling factor is 20%. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is half the star's surface, and 20% of that is spots, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) / (4πR²) ? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the star is a sphere, surface area 4πR². One hemisphere is covered with spots. So that's 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.4πR².

Now, the flux from the spots is less than the flux from
