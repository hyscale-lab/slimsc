Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some dark spots covering one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The problem says that because of these spots, when the star rotates, its brightness changes, and this looks a bit like a planet transiting in front of the star. Now, the question is, if instead there was a planet causing the same brightness dip, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

Hmm, right. So I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But I should make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Wait, but in this case, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. It has these dark spots. That complicates things. So the observed brightness variation isn't just due to a planet blocking light, but because parts of the star are dimmer. But the question says to imagine that instead, the same variation would be caused by a planet. So I need to find what R_planet would produce the same light curve amplitude as the current situation without spots.

Wait, the star's one hemisphere is covered with spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

But wait, the star's surface area is a sphere, so the total surface is 4π R^2. But since it's a hemisphere, the area is 2π R^2. So the spots cover 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot is cooler, so it emits less light. The star's total flux without spots depends on the temperature. The flux per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: σ T^4. So the star's total flux when it's not spotted would be (
