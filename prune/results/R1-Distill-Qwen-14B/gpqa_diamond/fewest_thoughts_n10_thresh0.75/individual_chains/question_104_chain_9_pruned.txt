Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. They want to know how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, what determines the Doppler shift in the RV method? Oh right, the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ), but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler relation when M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is the case here since Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's.

So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) )

But wait, since both stars have the same mass (Sun-like), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), but their RV shifts are different. The RV shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, right?

So the velocity amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (P)^(-1/3) ), because K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^2 (P) )^(1/3) ) ? Maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the RV method. Let me try to get the correct expression.

The RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * π) / (2 c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (G P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the eccentricity is zero (circular orbits), and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 π G) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the ratio of K for the two planets.

Let me consider the two planets, 1 and 2. Let K1 and K2 be their respective velocity amplitudes.

Since both stars have the same mass (M* same), and both planets have similar masses (M_p same, assuming "similar to Neptune" implies same mass), the
