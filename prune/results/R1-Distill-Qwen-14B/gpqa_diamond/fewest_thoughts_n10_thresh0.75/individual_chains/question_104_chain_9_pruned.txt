Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. Using RV method, they detected the planets. 

So, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods of the planets. How do these shifts relate to the period?

I remember that the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the velocity, K. K is the maximum velocity the star moves toward or away from us. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * sqrt(1 + (M_p/M_star))) )) but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun's mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So the formula simplifies. For circular orbits, e=0, so the denominator terms become 1. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(P)) ), but wait, wait. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, it approximates to K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / sin i )

Assuming sin i is the same for both (since the problem doesn't state otherwise), and the stars have the same mass, M_star is same for both. So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( P^(1/3) ), but wait, let me think again. Wait, another way: the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, given same mass star and same planet mass?

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But again, since M_p is much less than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈
