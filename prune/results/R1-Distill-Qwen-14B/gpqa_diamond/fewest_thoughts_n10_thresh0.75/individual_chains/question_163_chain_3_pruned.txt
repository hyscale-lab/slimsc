Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and determining the minimum volume of the acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, right, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base. When you add a strong acid, they should react.

Alright, the problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. The volume of the solution after dissolving is 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. The options are given with both the volume and the pH.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The formula mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)). So that's 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.00093597 moles, which I can round to about 0.000936 mol.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when it reacts with a strong monobasic acid (like HCl), it should undergo a neutralization reaction. The reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

Wait, wait. Let me check the stoichiometry. Each Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 would react with three moles of H+ (from the strong acid). So the acid is monobasic, so each provides one H+. Therefore, yes, the reaction is 1 Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 0.000936 = approx 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M (molarity) HCl. Molarity is moles per liter. So the volume needed (V) can be found by M = moles / volume → V = moles / M.

So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters. Since 1 liter is 1000 cm³, that's 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.
