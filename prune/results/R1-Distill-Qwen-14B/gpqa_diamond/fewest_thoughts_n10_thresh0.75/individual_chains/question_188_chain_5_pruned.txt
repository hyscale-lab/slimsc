Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the crystallographic directions and the lattice parameters. But wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal exactly?

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and the angles between them are the same. Oh right, in this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so that's the edge length 'a' of the unit cell, right? Because in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are the same length.

The interplanar distance formula I recall is d = a/(sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ)), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Oh wait, no, another approach is using the Miller indices. For a general plane (hkl), the interplanar distance d is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )) ), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, I think I might be getting the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh right, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l²)), but since this is a rhombohedral crystal, the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the formula must involve the angles. 

Alternatively, another formula comes to mind. The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is d = (a²)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )) ), where θ is the angle between the edges. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so perhaps there's a simplified version.

Wait, the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is d = (a)/(sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )) ), but wait, is that right? Because in the cubic case, the angles are 90, so cos θ would be zero, and the formula reduces to a/sqrt(h² +
