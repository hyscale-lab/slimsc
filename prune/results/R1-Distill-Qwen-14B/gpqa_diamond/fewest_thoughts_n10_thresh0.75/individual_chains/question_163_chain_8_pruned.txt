Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we want to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we need the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is Iron(III) hydroxide, right? It's a solid, and to dissolve it, we usually need an acid. Since it's a hydroxide, adding an acid should react with it. The acid is monobasic, which means it donates one proton per molecule, like HCl or HNO3.

First, I think I should write the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so it should react with a strong acid to produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and maybe some salt.

The reaction should be something like: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Wait, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so it takes three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

So, the first thing I need to do is calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)).

So Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17 (16+1), so 3*17=51. So 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 moles. Let me calculate that.

0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. So about 9.36e-4 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ (from the acid), the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid provided is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter. To find the volume needed, moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So Volume = moles / Molarity.

So the volume is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 moles per L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the options don't have that exact number. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Option B is 30.09 cm³.

Hmm, wait, maybe I should be precise with the molar mass. Let me recalculate the mole count.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.845 g/mol, O is 16.00, H is 1.008.

So Fe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = approx 0.0009358 moles. So 0.0009358 * 3 = 0.0028075 moles H+ needed.

Volume = 0.0028075 / 0.1 = 0.028075 liters, which is 28.075 cm³. So about 28.08 cm³. So that's close to option C's 28.05.

Wait, but why is the option C's volume 28.05 cm³? Maybe I made a calculation mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more complex. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and perhaps it
