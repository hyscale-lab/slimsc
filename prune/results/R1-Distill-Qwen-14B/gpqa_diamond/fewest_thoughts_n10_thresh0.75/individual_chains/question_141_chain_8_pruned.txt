Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, so I'll need to think carefully. First, I should probably draw the structure of the compound in question to visualize it.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe 2-d is another substituent. Wait, I think the 'd' might refer to a deuterium substitution. Wait, no, that's probably not right. Let me think again. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe it's 2-dichlorobromobenzene? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the name is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Oh wait, perhaps 'd' stands for di something else. Wait no, maybe the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because the question uses 'd' in the name, but maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-diethyl something? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure
