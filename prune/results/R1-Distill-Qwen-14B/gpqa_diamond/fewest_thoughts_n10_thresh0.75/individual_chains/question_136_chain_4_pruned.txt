Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says: There's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, wait a second. The field is a vector field, right? So it's not just the magnitude, but the vector itself. Since it's only along the radial direction, I can express it in spherical coordinates as f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector. So, f = (1/r²) er.

Now, I need to find the divergence of this vector field. I remember that the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that only has a radial component (A_r, 0, 0) is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r). So in this case, A_r is 1/r². Let's compute that.

So, A_r = 1/r². The divergence would be (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute this step by step. r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. That would make the divergence zero everywhere except maybe at r=0.

Wait, but wait. Hold on. What about at r=0? Because 1/r² becomes infinite there, so maybe the divergence isn't defined at the origin. But for points away from the origin, the divergence is zero.

So, the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at r=0. But wait, I've heard about Gauss's Law and similar concepts. What if I think about the integral of the divergence over a volume? That's the same as the flux through the surface, according to the divergence theorem.

Oh right, the divergence theorem! So the volume integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the surface integral of f · n over the surface of the sphere, where n is the outward normal vector.

Wait, but in this case, if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the
