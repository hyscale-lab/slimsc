Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The options are A to D percentages.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the complexes are Co(SCN)n^2−n, with n from 1 to 4, I think. The blue ones are probably the dithiocyanato complexes, which would be n=2 and maybe n=4? Wait, I'm a bit confused. The dithiocyanato might refer to the number of SCN ligands. Wait, dithiocyanato implies two SCN per Co, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. But wait, the β values are given as β1, β2, etc. So each β corresponds to the complex with n=1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ions.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue color is for the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex, which is n=2. So we need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the n=2 form.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the blue color is for the n=4 complex. Let me think. I remember that different Co complexes have different colors. The [Co(SCN)]+ is pink maybe, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is blue, and [Co(SCN)₃]^3- is green, and [Co(SCN)₄]^4- might be another color. But I'm not certain. So the question specifies "dithiocyanato," which implies two SCN per Co, so [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Wait, but the problem says "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. So assuming that the dithiocyanato refers to two SCN ligands, which would be n=2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Now, the approach is to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. To do that, I think I need to calculate the concentrations of each possible complex and then find the ratio.

The total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But that's the total, so it includes all the Co species: Co²+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, [Co(SCN)₃]^3−, and [Co(SCN)₄]^4−.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. So initially, Co²+ is in solution, and SCN- is present. The complexes form, and the total Co is the sum of all complexed and free Co²+.

The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

So, the formation of each complex is as follows:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)

Wait, no. Wait, each β is for the step-wise formation. For example, β1 is the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. Alternatively, βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

I think βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. So for the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n+) complex, the βn is the equilibrium constant:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)] ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, formation constants are often given for each step. Like, β1 is the first step, Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc. So each β is for the nth step.

In that case, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, that makes sense. So the overall β_total for n=2 would be β1 * β2.

So for each complex, the overall β is the product of the individual βs up to that n. Wait, but in the question, the given βs are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think each βn is the cumulative formation constant up to n ligands. Because β4=16 is lower than β3=63, which is a bit confusing because normally the formation constants increase with each step until a maximum and then decrease if the complex is labile. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the possible complexes and their formation constants.

The problem is to find the amount of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ relative to all Co species.

So first, I'll model each possible complex.

Let me denote the concentration of Co
