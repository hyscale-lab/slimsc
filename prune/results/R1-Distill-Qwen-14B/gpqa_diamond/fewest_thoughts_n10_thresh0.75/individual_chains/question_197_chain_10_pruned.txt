Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction uses Cl- with CuCl, but that's for adding halogens. Wait, red phosphorus and HI—oh right, that's the reaction for eliminating a halide. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps it's a different type of reaction. Wait, wait no. Oh right, when you have an alkyl halide and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's the Wurtz reaction. Or wait, no, the Wurtz reaction is between two alkyl halides. Or wait, perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the compound is a nitride or something. Hmm.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI... Oh right! That's the reaction used for converting a nitrile group into an amine. No, wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's for the formation of alkenes. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think about nitriles. Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce nitriles to amines,
