Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps, right? Like the proton-proton chain, and other reactions. Oh wait, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. I think the pp chain has multiple branches. The main one is pp-I, but there are also pp-II and pp-III, each producing different neutrinos.

So the pp-III branch must be a part of the proton-proton cycle that contributes to the overall neutrino flux. The question says this branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, which is the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any effect from this change would have been felt here on Earth only after that time.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in the core, right? So if pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop as well. But what does pp-III contribute? I think the pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing a lot of neutrinos, and the others contribute less. So if pp-III stops, the flux from that part would drop.

Now, the question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So which band corresponds to which neutrino energies?

I recall that the main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced in the fusion processes. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-II and pp-III produce higher energy ones. For example, the pp-I process produces neutrinos around 0.25 MeV, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the higher energy neutrinos come from the later stages in the chain. 

Wait, in the proton-proton chain, the initial step is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, that's the pp-I branch. But then, pp-II and pp-III are other possible branches. I thought the pp-III branch might involve triple-alpha reactions or something else, but perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch refers to a part where
