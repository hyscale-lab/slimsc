Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Hmm, 2e is twice the elementary charge. Oh wait, e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so each charge here is about 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them. Since this is an isolated system, we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy.

Wait, for point charges, the potential energy between two charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh, right, the formula is (1/2) * sum over all pairs of (k * q_i * q_j / r_ij). But since all the 12 charges are at the same distance from P, this might simplify things.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, how does that affect the potential energy? Let me think. The 13th charge (call it Q) is at the center. Each of the other 12 charges (q) is at a distance of 2 meters from Q. So, the potential energy due to Q and each of the 12 charges would be U = k * Q * q / r.

But wait, when calculating the total potential energy of the system, we consider all pairs. So, we have two parts:

1. The potential energy between the central charge (Q) and each of the 12 charges (q) around it.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges on the sphere.

So, the total potential energy U_total is the sum of these two parts.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, the charge Q is 2
