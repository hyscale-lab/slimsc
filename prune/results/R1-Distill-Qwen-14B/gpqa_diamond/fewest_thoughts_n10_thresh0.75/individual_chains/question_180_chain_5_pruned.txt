Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. The particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that for them. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what kind of energy we're dealing with here. Since we're talking about charges and their positions, this must be an electrostatic potential energy problem. The system's potential energy is due to the arrangement of these charges.

So, the system has 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other twelve are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the twelve is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. 

Wait, but each of the twelve charges is 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So, each of the twelve is at a distance of 2 meters from that 13th charge. So, the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the twelve and the thirteenth charge.

But wait, there's also potential energy between the twelve charges themselves, right? Because they are all at the same point (since they're each 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other might vary). But I think in this problem, since they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their positions around P could be arranged in a sphere or something. But since the problem is talking about the minimum energy, I need to arrange them in a way that minimizes the total potential energy.

Wait, no. The problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed at 2m away. So the distances between each of the twelve charges would vary, but if they're arranged in a symmetric way, like on a sphere, that could
