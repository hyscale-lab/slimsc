Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives some parameters and I need to find out by what factor Star_1 is more luminous than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

So, the first thing I remember is that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and its temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is the radius, and T is the effective temperature. Since both stars are black bodies, this formula should apply.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, their masses are in the same ratio, 1.5 times as well, but I'm not sure how the mass relates here. Maybe it's just extra information or perhaps it's a hint towards something else? Hmm, but since the question is about luminosity, I might not need the mass right now. Let's see.

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, that's interesting because if they have the same λ_max, then T1 = T2. So T1 = T2.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem says they found the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So that would imply that their T_eff (effective temperatures) are the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but then I'm confused because if R1 is larger than R2 by a factor of 1.5 and T is same, then L1 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) * L2. But since T1=T2, the T^4 terms cancel out. So L1
