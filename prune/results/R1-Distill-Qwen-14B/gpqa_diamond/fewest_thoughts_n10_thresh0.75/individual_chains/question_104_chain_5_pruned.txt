Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as each other and similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits, which is good because that might simplify some calculations.

They used the RV method, which I remember detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit towards and away from us as the planet orbits. The problem gives the periodic shifts in the spectral lines for each star.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but I'm trying to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I think the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Or wait, more specifically, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula. Let me recall the formula. I think the formula for K is something like K = (v) which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula I remember is from the radial velocity method. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )^(1/2) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. Since Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's, maybe we can approximate M_planet << M_star. Then the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach I remember is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star) ) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) ), but when e=0 because the orbits are circular, it's just K = ( (M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star) * a ) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards us. K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p / M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximately 1, so it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) /
