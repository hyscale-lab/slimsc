Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. 

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull making the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The setup: there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. How many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's? The options are A to D.

Wait, so I need to find Period2 / Period1. Hmm. 

I remember that the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude, K, which is related to the star's movement. The formula for K involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star. 

The formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) ) / (1 AU)^(1/3) ??? No, wait, perhaps another way. 

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ]

But since the planets are Neptune-like, their mass is much smaller than the star's (M_planet << M_star), so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the equation simplifies, I think. 

So, K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3)) ]

Wait, but let me think about the exact formula. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh
