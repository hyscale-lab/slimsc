Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When they observe this star, they see brightness variations because of rotation, which could look like an exoplanet's transit. The question is, to get the same brightness change as if a planet were transiting, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

Hmm. Right, when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the areas of the planet and the star. But in this case, the star has spots, so when it rotates, spots come into and out of view. The total light we receive changes because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light.

Wait, but the problem is asking, what planet size would cause the same dip as this spotty star. So, without spots, what planet would give the same signal.

Wait, no. The scenario is that the star has spots, but the question is, what would the planet look like in terms of size to produce the same amplitude. So, I need to calculate the brightness variation due to the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

First, I'll think about the star's brightness variation caused by the spots. The star's hemisphere (which is half the surface area) has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So, the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. But wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun, so the surface area is 4πR². Since the spots cover one hemisphere (so 2πR²) and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, each spot is cooler. So the total flux from the star when the spots are facing us would be less than when the unspotted side is facing.

Wait, no. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's only one hemisphere, when that side is facing us, we see the spots; when it's the other hemisphere, we don't. But the spots are located on one side, so the brightness variation depends on how much of the spotted area is blocked as the star rotates.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view and then goes away. So the maximum dip would be when the maximum amount of spots is in front, right?

Wait, but the problem says the filling factor is 20%. Wait, what's the filling factor? Oh, right, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots.

So, the star's total emitted flux normally is L = 4πR² * sigma * Teff^4. But when the spots are present, part of the star's surface is cooler.

The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part plus the flux from the spotted part.

The unspotted part is (100% - 20%) of the hemisphere. Wait, no. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². The rest is unspotted: 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

The flux from the unspotted area is 1.6πR² * sigma * (6000)^4.

The flux from the spots is 0.4πR² * sigma * (5000)^4. Because the temperature is 1000K less, so 5000K.

So the total flux when the spots are facing us is:

L_spots = 1.6πR² * sigma*(6000^4) + 0.4πR² * sigma*(5000^4)

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is L_unspotted = 4πR² * sigma*(6000^4) * ( (2πR²) / (4πR²) )? Wait, no. Wait, when the other hemisphere is the one without spots, then the entire hemisphere is at 6000K. So L_unspotted_hemisphere = 2πR² * sigma * (6000)^4.

Wait, but the star's total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is 2πR² * sigma * (6000)^4 + 2πR² * sigma * (6000)^4? No, wait, the star's surface is 4πR². When one hemisphere (2πR²) is spotted 20%, and the other hemisphere is unspotted, the total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is just the flux from the unspotted hemisphere plus whatever is on the other side, but the other side is the one with the spots.

Wait, no, when the star is viewed face-on, if a hemisphere is covered in spots, and it's rotating, then when the spots are on the far side, we don't see them. So when the unspotted hemisphere is the front, the total flux is the flux of the unspotted part.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the star as a whole.

The star's normal flux is L = 4πR² * sigma * Teff^4.

When one hemisphere is spotted (20% of that hemisphere), the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

L_spotted = (1 - 0.2) * (2πR²) * sigma * Teff^4 + 0.2 * (2πR²) * sigma * (Teff - 1000)^4

Because the 20% of the hemisphere is at a lower temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the average flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view and go out of view. The maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but if the star is rotating, the spots will come into view as it rotates, so the brightness variation would be between the maximum (unspotted) and minimum (spotted) flux.

So, the amplitude of the variation would be (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

Wait, but the problem says that the photometric observations will show periodic variations that resemble an exoplanet transit. So, the amplitude of the brightness dip is the same as if a planet were transiting.

So, to find the planet radius Rpl such that the dip when the planet transits is the same as the dip when the star's spots are in view.

Wait, but the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * (F_planet/F_star), but wait, the planet doesn't emit light, it just blocks the star's light. So the dip is (Area of planet)/(Area of star) = (Rpl^2) / (Rstar^2). But if the star is varying because of spots, the dip is (Area of spots visible) / (Area of star) multiplied by the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the difference in flux when the spots are present versus when they are not.

Wait, the star's flux without spots is L0 = 4πR² σ (6000)^4.

With spots on one hemisphere, when the spotted side is facing us, the flux is L_spotted = [ (1 - 0.2) * 2πR² + 0.2 * 2πR² ] σ (Teff)^4? No, because the spots have a lower temperature.

Wait, no. Each spot's flux is less. So the total flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

Unspotted area: 0.8 * 2πR² * σ (6000)^4.

Spotted area: 0.2 * 2πR² * σ (5000)^4.

So the total flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

L_spotted_hemisphere = 0.8 * 2πR² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2πR² σ (5000)^4.

The flux from the other hemisphere (unspotted): 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

So when we see the entire star, the total flux is the sum of both hemispheres.

Wait, wait, no. If the star is rotating, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is the sum of the spotted hemisphere's flux. When the other hemisphere is facing us, it's the unspotted hemisphere's flux.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when we look at it, if the spotted side is towards us, the entire flux we receive is from the spotted hemisphere and the far side (unspotted). No, wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when we look at it, we're seeing the light from the hemisphere that's facing us. The other hemisphere is on the back side, and we can't see it.

Ah, right! So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we receive the flux from the spotted hemisphere. When it's the other way around, the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so we receive its flux.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

L_spotted = 0.8 * 2πR² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2πR² σ (5000)^4.

And when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

L_unspotted = 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

So the difference in flux is L_unspotted - L_spotted.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is (L_unspotted - L_spotted) / L_unspotted.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the flux varies between L_spotted and L_unspotted. So the maximum flux is L_unspotted, and the minimum is L_spotted.

So the variation amplitude is (L_unspotted - L_spotted) divided by L_unspotted.

But wait, the problem is asking, what's the planet radius that would cause the same dip as this variation.

So the dip when a planet transits is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * (F_star). But actually, the dip fraction is (Rpl / Rstar)^2, because it's the area blocked.

Wait, no. The dip depth is (Area of planet)/(Area of star) = (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2). Because a planet blocks a part of the star's light.

So to find the planet radius Rpl such that (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) equals the brightness variation caused by the spots.

So first, compute the brightness variation (delta L / L) caused by the spots.

Let me compute L_unspotted and L_spotted.

L_unspotted = 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

L_spotted = [0.8 * 2πR² σ (6000)^4 ] + [0.2 * 2πR² σ (5000)^4 ].

So the difference: L_unspotted - L_spotted = (2πR² σ (6000^4)) - [1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) ]

= 2πR² σ (6000^4) - 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)

= (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4)) - (0.4 π R² σ (5000^4))

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

So the dip is (L_unspotted - L_spotted) = 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

The maximum brightness is L_unspotted:

L_unspotted = 2 π R² σ (6000^4 )

So the amplitude as a fraction is:

delta_L / L_unspotted = [ 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [ 2 π R² σ (6000^4) ) ]

Simplify:

= (0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (2 * 6000^4 )

= (0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / 6000^4 )

= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ ?

Let me calculate step by step.

0.8333^2 = approx 0.6944.

Then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

So delta_L / L_unspotted ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% dip when the spotted side is facing us.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher. So the dip is 10% when the spots are in view.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's brightness varies between maximum (unspotted) and minimum (spotted). The dip is the difference between maximum and minimum flux, as a fraction of the maximum.

So the amplitude is (L_max - L_min)/L_max, which is 0.1035 or about 10.35%.

Now, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So set this equal to 0.1035.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps.

So, the flux computation:

L_unspotted = 2πR² σ (6000^4 )

L_spotted = 0.8 * 2πR² σ (6000^4 ) + 0.2 * 2πR² σ (5000^4 )

When we compute L_unspotted - L_spotted:

= 2πR² σ (6000^4 ) - [1.6 π R² σ (6000^4 ) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 ) ]

= (2 -1.6) π R² σ (6000^4 ) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

Divided by L_unspotted:

0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ] / (2 π R² σ 6000^4 )

Cancel terms: π R² σ cancels.

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (2 * 6000^4 )

= (0.4/2) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 = 0.103549.

So (delta_L/L) ≈ 10.35% → which is the dip.

So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotty star, we analyze the star's brightness change due to its dark spots and equate it to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).  
   - The effective temperature of the star is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, and the spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Calculations**:  
   - The total flux from the star without spots is:  
     \[
     L_{\text{unspotted}} = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]  
     When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:  
     \[
     L_{\text{spotted}} = 0.8 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4
     \]  
     Here, 80% of the hemisphere is unspotted, and 20% is spotted.

3. **Brightness Variation**:  
   - The difference in flux between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres is:  
     \[
     \Delta L = L_{\text{unspotted}} - L_{\text{spotted}}
     \]  
     Substituting the expressions for \( L_{\text{unspotted}} \) and \( L_{\text{spotted}} \):  
     \[
     \Delta L = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 - \left[ 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4 \right]
     \]  
     Simplifying:  
     \[
     \Delta L = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right]
     \]  

   - The fraction of the flux change relative to the unspotted flux is:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right]}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4}
     \]  
     Canceling terms:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 \left[ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right]}{2 (6000)^4}
     \]  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]  

4. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]  
   - Substituting:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - 0.4823 \right] = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.1035
     \]  
     Thus, the brightness variation is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

5. **Planet Radius**:  
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the area blocked:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]  
     Substituting \( \frac{\Delta L}{L_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.1035 \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]  
     Taking the square root:  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.32
     \]  

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to option **D**.

**Answer: D**
