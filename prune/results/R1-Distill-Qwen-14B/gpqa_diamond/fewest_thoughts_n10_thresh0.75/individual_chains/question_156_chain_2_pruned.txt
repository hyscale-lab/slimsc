Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me break it down.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each would show.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is an oxidizing agent often used in epoxidation of alkenes. So in both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, the alkenes are reacting with mCPBA to form epoxides. 

Wait, but how does the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affect the epoxide formed? Oh right, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides (trans), and for a cis (Z) alkene, the oxygen atoms will be on the same side (cis) of the epoxide.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide (epoxide where the substituents on each carbon are opposite each other). Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening. 

In acid conditions, the epoxide ring opens via a protonation of the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The mechanism usually involves the formation of a carbocation, which can undergo a hydride shift if possible. Wait, wait—oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond. So when it forms the epoxide, the structure will be symmetric as well. Let me visualize the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, but more accurately, the structure is CH2CH2 on each side of the double bond. So for oct-4-ene, the molecule is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but wait, the exact structure isn't necessary for the stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure of the epoxide. So (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 groups on either end of the double bond, but with opposite configurations. When mCPBA adds across, it forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen-bearing carbons are trans. So the epoxide would have the two substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups) on opposite sides. 

Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide opens. The ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions leads to the formation of a diol. The ring opens because the oxygen gets protonated, and then the nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon. Wait, no, in general, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon in the more stable carbocation. Wait, no, wait—epoxide ring opening in acid: the protonation makes the oxygen more electrophilic. The attack occurs at the less substituted carbon because the carbocation formed is more stable if it's at the more substituted position. Hmm, not sure,
