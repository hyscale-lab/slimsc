Okay, I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, what's LTE again? Oh, right, it means that the gas in a small region is in thermal equilibrium, so we can use the Boltzmann distribution for the energy levels. So the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. 

The key here is the Boltzmann factor. The population of an energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant. 

So, for star_1 and star_2, the ratio of their excitation levels would relate their temperatures. Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. 

The ratio of excitations, n1/n2, is given as 2. So, n1 = 2n2. 

But wait, the excitation is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So, n1/n2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))]. 

That simplifies to exp[ (ΔE/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), right? Wait, wait. Let me think. 

Actually, when you have the ratio of the exponents: 

exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) )

Hmm, not sure if that's right. Let me compute it step by step. 

The exponent is [ (-ΔE/(k T1) ) - (-ΔE/(k T2) ) ] which is ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ].

Which is ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So, the ratio n1/n2 is exp( ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] )

We know that n1/n2 = 2. So,

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, that's the equation we get.

Wait, the problem gives us ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, interesting! So ΔE is equal to k. Because 1.
