Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms relates to their temperature. The energy levels and how much they're excited probably depend on the thermal energy of the star's atmosphere.

Wait, the problem mentions LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, each region of the photosphere is in equilibrium, meaning the excitation states can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio between two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T). So, if the energy levels are E1 and E2, and E2 is higher than E1, then the ratio N2/N1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ).

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, in the question, it's the same energy level being considered. Oh wait, no, the energy difference is given between the considered energy levels. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So, the same for both stars. So, for star_1, N1_upper/N1_lower = 2 times that of star_2. Or wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, it says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, for a given energy level, the excitation is higher. Oh wait, no, I think the question is that the number of excited atoms in a higher level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Because when atoms are more excited, they are in higher energy states.

So, the ratio of the populations between the two energy levels is higher in star_1. Let's say that the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio of excited to ground state is twice. But I'm a bit unclear on the exact setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is N1_2/N1_1 = 2*(N2_2/N2_1), where N1 is for star_1 and N2 for star_2.

Wait, let me think again. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the excitation level is higher. So, the population in the higher energy level is higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Let me write it down.

For star_1: N1_2/N1_1 = exp( -ΔE
