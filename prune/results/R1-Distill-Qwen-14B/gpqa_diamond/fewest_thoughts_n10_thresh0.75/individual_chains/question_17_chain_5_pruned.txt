Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these equilibrium problems. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The setup is that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They say the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other reactions affecting the EDTA. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY^2- where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. So the reaction would be Ca^2+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-.

Wait, but wait. The formation constant Kf is given. Oh right, Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf would be [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). 

But wait, the problem gives KCa-EDTA as 5x10^10. I think that's the same as Kf for the formation of the complex. So Kf = 5e10.

The solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of CaY^2-.

I'm supposed to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions. Oh, right, because in solution, some of the complex will dissociate into Ca^2+ and Y^4-.

Wait, but wait again. The solution is 0.02 M CaY^2- and we assume it's fully formed? No, because the Kf is large, but I think even with a large Kf, there's some dissociation, but the free ions will be very low.

So let's model the dissociation. Let me write the equation:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-] = 5e10.

But in this solution, the initial concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M
