Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through this step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So, let's break it down. The initial solution is made by mixing two equal volumes of acetic acid and water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M, but when we dilute it by doubling the volume, the concentration halves. So 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When you mix it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find out the equivalence point first because that might help with the second part.

The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Then when diluted to 0.04 L, it's still 0.001 moles. So yeah, moles of CH3COOH is 0.001.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Let V be the volume needed at equivalence point. Since moles NaOH = 0.1 * V (in liters), and that should equal 0.001 moles.

0.1 * V = 0.001 → V = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So, at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question says what's the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So for the 25% titration, we're 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, let's tackle each part: first, the pH at 25% titration, then the equivalence point.

Starting with the 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. So we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.8
