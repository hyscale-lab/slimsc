Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question again. So, there's a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. 

First, the data given includes IR and NMR spectra. Let me think about what each of these tells me.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. I remember that a carbonyl group (like in a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid) absorbs around there. Wait, but a carboxylic acid's O-H is usually a broad peak around 3000-2500, which matches the first IR region. So maybe compound X has a carboxylic acid group. The 1720 could be the carbonyl, but wait, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but maybe it's higher if it's something else. Hmm, another possibility is an ester or ketone. But let's look at the NMR next.

The NMR data: The protons are split into several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm. So that fits with the IR data suggesting a carboxylic acid.

Next, looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Each doublet indicates two sets of two protons each. So, a substitution pattern where the substituents are opposite each other on the ring. Like maybe a para-substituted phenyl group.

Then, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet integrating to one proton. That could be a methine (CH) group attached to something else. 

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), that's two protons in a multiplet. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point or connected to another group. 

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet as a doublet? Wait, no, it's a doublet with 3H. A triplet would be if it's next to two protons. So a doublet of 3H suggests maybe a methyl group attached to an oxygen or another CH group. Wait, let me think. A doublet for 3H could be a methyl adjacent to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, in isobutyl groups, the methyl is attached to a CH2, but maybe that's getting ahead of myself.

Lastly, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet for 3H, which is typical for a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. So this suggests an ethyl group somewhere, perhaps as a substituent.

Putting this together, the structure seems to be a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents at the para positions: one is the carboxylic acid group (from the IR and the 10.5 ppm peak), and the other is an ethyl group with some branching. Wait, but the substituents on the benzene have to be identified.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carboxylic acid and another group. Let me think about the NMR signals: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group connected to the ring. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be adjacent to that CH, perhaps a CH2 connected to the CH. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is another CH3 attached to the CH. Wait, that would make a group like CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, maybe something else. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, let's consider the substituent on the benzene. If the ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1, then perhaps the other substituent is a propyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group attached with some branching.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a terminal ethyl group. So maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH2 or CH group. Let me think about the substituent structure.

Looking at the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm: COOH (carboxylic acid)
- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: para-substituted benzene (two groups opposite each other)
- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): maybe a CH connected to something else, perhaps a branch point
- 1.7 (m,2H): two adjacent CH2 maybe?
- 1.4 (d,3H): perhaps a methyl attached to a CH, which is also attached to something else
- 0.9 (t,3H): a terminal methyl, part of an ethyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. But wait, the substituent on the benzene is more likely to be an isobutyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait! That's the Hinsberg reaction, which is used to determine whether an amine is primary, secondary, or tertiary
