Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. And I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by n, where n is the refractive index. So when the medium is stationary, the speed is v_light = c/n. But here, the glass is moving. So does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab frame?

Oh right, this is a problem involving reference frames and maybe the addition of velocities. But wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So even if the glass is moving, the light inside it would still have to travel at c in whatever frame we're considering.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab's perspective, does the speed of the light change? Or is it still moving at c?

But wait, the speed of light in a medium isn't just c/n, it's c divided by n. So normally, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c
