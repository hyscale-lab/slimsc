Okay, so I've got this problem here about an algorithm that takes DNA sequences and outputs some numbers. I need to figure out what the output is for the input ACAGTGACC based on the examples given. Let's break it down step by step.

The examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, I remember that DNA is made up of four nucleotides: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). Each has a specific weight or value assigned. Wait, I think each base's value is added up to get the total.

Let me think about the first example: AGG. That's A, G, G. So if I assign each a value, the sum would be the output. Let's calculate what each base could be worth.

AGG is 3 letters: A, G, G. So the sum is A_val + G_val + G_val. The output is 115. So, A + 2G = 115.

The second example is TGCTGA, which is 6 letters: T, G, C, T, G, A. So the sum is T + G + C + T + G + A. That's 2T + 2G + C + A = 176.

Wait, so now I have two equations:

1) A + 2G = 115
2) 2T + 2G + C + A = 176

Hmm, but there are four variables here (A, T, C, G), and only two equations. That's not enough to solve uniquely. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps each base has a fixed value that's standard. Oh yeah, sometimes they assign numerical values based on their positions in the alphabet or something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe each base's value is its position in the alphabet. Let's see, A is the 1st letter, T is 20th, C is 3rd, G is 7th. Let me plug in these values.

For AGG: A=1, G=7, G=7. Sum is 1+7+7=15. But the output is 115, which is way higher. So that can't be
