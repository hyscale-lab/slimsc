Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters. I need to determine which of these can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

First, I should note the key points from the problem statement. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star must have a V magnitude (apparent, I think) ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, wait—wait, no. Because the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, magnitudes work in reverse: lower numbers are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can see stars with V mag ≤17. Because anything brighter (smaller V mag) than 17 is okay. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so V mag ≤16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 (since HIRES requires brighter than 16, which is V ≤16). Because if the star is brighter than 16 (V ≤16), it can be seen by HIRES. And for ESPRESSO, it can see V ≤17. So any star that is ≤16 would be observable by both.

But wait, I should check each star's apparent V magnitude. Because some stars have absolute magnitudes, so I need to compute their apparent V mag based on distance and any extinction.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent V mag is M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Wait, is that correct? The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs. So for d=10, log10(1)=0 → m = M. So Star1's m is 15.5. Wait, but that's apparent magnitude. But wait, if it's 15.5, then for HIRES, which requires V mag ≤16, that's okay. And for ESPRESSO, which requires ≤17. So Star1 would be observable by both. But wait, let me check: 15.5 is less than 16 and less than 17, so yes, both can detect it.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. The way the problem is worded: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So for ESPRESSO, they can observe stars with V ≤17. So Star1 has m=15.5, which is okay for both.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5. So for HIRES, which requires V ≤16, 16.5 is too faint. So HIRES can't observe it. So Star2 is out for this question since we need stars detectable by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, right! Extinction affects apparent magnitude. The formula for extinction (A(V)) is A(V) = 3.1 * E(B-V). So 3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag. So the star's actual apparent V mag (without extinction) would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A(V). Wait no, wait. Wait, the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + extinction. Because extinction makes stars appear fainter. So if a star's true apparent magnitude is m, and extinction adds A, the observed m is m + A. Wait, no, because if there's more extinction, the star looks dimmer, which is a higher magnitude. So, if the observed m is larger (fainter) because of extinction.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The formula is m_observed = m_true + A. So Star3's true apparent V is 15.5, but with extinction of 1.86, so m_observed = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag. So for HIRES, which requires V ≤16, 17.36 is too faint. So HIRES can't detect it. For ESPRESSO, which requires ≤17, 17.36 is just above, so ESPRESSO can't detect it either. So Star3 is not observable by either. So Star3 can't be detected by both.

Star4: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m_true = 15.5. E(B-V) is 0.4. So A(V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So for HIRES, which requires ≤16, 16.74 is too faint. For ESPRESSO, which requires ≤17, 16.74 is okay. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So can't be detected by both.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m_true = M +5 log10(5/10) = 16.5 +5 log10(0.5) → log10(0.5)= -0.3010 → 5*(-0.3010)= -1.505. So m_true=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approximately 15.0.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Because M is absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So for d=5 pc, log10(5)=0.69897. So 5 * 0.69897 ≈ 3.4949. Then m=16.5 +3.4949 -5 = 16.5 -1.505=14.995, as before. So m_true is about 15.0.

But wait, Star5 is at 5 pc, so let me double-check. M is 16.5. m=16.5 +5*(log10(5) -1). Because, m = M +5*(log10(d) -1). So log10(5)=0.69897, so log10(5)-1= -0.30103. 5*(-0.30103)= -1.50515. So m =16.5 -1.50515=14.99485, so ~15.0.

So Star5's m_true is 15.0. Now, any extinction? The problem says E(B-V)=0.4 mag? No, wait, Star5's parameters: absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc, with no mention of E(B-V). So Star5 has no extinction mentioned. So E(B-V)=0. So A(V)=0. So m_observed is 15.0. So for HIRES, which requires ≤16, 15.0 is okay. For ESPRESSO, ≤17, also okay. So Star5 can be observed by both.

Wait, but in the options, let's check which stars are in which options.

So from the analysis:

Star1: m=15.5, so visible by both.

Star5: m=15, visible by both.

Wait, but let me recheck: Star1's m is 15.5, which is within both's limits.

Star2: m=16.5, which is beyond HIRES' limit.

Star3: m_observed=17.36, beyond both.

Star4: m_observed=16.74, which is within ESPRESSO's limit but beyond HIRES.

Star5: m=15, within both.

So which options include Star1 and Star5?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5.

Wait, Star4's m_observed is 16.74. HIRES requires m ≤16 → can't see it. So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Star3's m_observed=17.36, which is above both, so no.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Both have m above 16 and 17, so no.

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect. Star4: m_obs=16.74 → ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't. So option D includes Star1 which is good, but Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So D is not correct.

Wait, so looking back: the correct stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5. Because Star1: m=15.5, both. Star5: m=15, both.

So looking at the options, which options include these two? The options are:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → no, Star3 is too faint.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

Wait, the options don't have an option with Star1 and Star5. Wait, let me recheck the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Hmm. So according to our analysis, Star1 and Star5 are the ones that can be observed by both. But none of the options have both. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let's re-examine Star4.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, located at 10 pc.

So m_true = M =15.5. E(B-V)=0.4. So A(V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So for HIRES, 16.74 is above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Star5: m_observed=15.0, so both can detect.

Star1: m=15.5, both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but the options don't list any option with Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated something. Let me double-check each star.

Star1: Absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. So m=15.5. No extinction. So m=15.5. So for HIRES (<=16), yes. For ESPRESSO (<=17), yes. So can be observed by both.

Star2: Apparent V=16.5. So for HIRES, which requires V <=16, it's too faint. So only ESPRESSO can observe it. So no.

Star3: Apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So A(V)=3.1*0.6=1.86. So m_observed=15.5 +1.86=17.36. So for HIRES, 17.36 >16, can't. For ESPRESSO, 17.36 >17, can't. So no.

Star4: m_true=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4. So A(V)=1.24. m_observed=16.74. So HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can. So no.

Star5: Star5's m_true=15.0, no extinction. So m=15.0. Both can detect.

So the two stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But looking back at the options, none of them have Star1 and Star5 together. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the parameters.

Wait, let's look at the options again:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be seen by either.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → both can't be seen by HIRES.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be seen by both, but Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

Wait, so according to this, no option matches. But that can't be right because the question must have an answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star4's apparent magnitude.

Wait, Star4: absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. So m_true=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4 → A(V)=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, but if the distance is 10 pc, and the star is at 10 pc, then m_true is M, because m = M + 5 log10(d/10) → d=10, m=M. So yes.

So Star4's m_observed is 16.74. So for HIRES, it's above 16: can't be detected.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5. But none of the options include both. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1's parameters.

Wait, let me recheck Star5. Star5: absolute V=16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) → d=5 → log10(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m is ~15.0. So correct.

So where are the options?

Looking again:

Option B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 is 17.36, which is too faint for both. So no.

Option A: Star4 (16.74) and Star5 (15.0). Star4 can't be seen by HIRES, so this pair can't be. So only Star5 is in their pair.

Option D: Star1 (15.5) and Star4 (16.74). So Star1 can be seen by both, but Star4 can't. So the pair can't be.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in Star1's calculation. Star1: m=15.5. Let me see: HIRES can see up to 16, so 15.5 is okay. ESPRESSO up to 17, so also okay. So Star1 can be seen by both.

So the pair is Star1 and Star5. Are they in any option? No. So perhaps the correct option is none, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star3's calculation.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48 deg, apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance=15 pc.

Wait, wait a minute! Wait, the star's apparent V mag is already 15.5, but does that include extinction? Or is that the intrinsic magnitude?

Wait, the problem statement for Star3 says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag..." So that's the observed apparent magnitude, and E(B-V) is the color excess, which is used to calculate the extinction.

Wait no, wait. When they say "apparent V magnitude of 15.5", that's the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So the intrinsic (unreddened) V magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A(V). Because the star is reddened, so m_observed = m_intrinsic + A(V). So if Star3's m_observed is 15.5, and A(V)=1.86, then the intrinsic m would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, that's not the case. Wait, no. The extinction adds to the apparent magnitude, making it appear fainter. So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A(V).

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. Let me clarify.

The star's absolute magnitude is its intrinsic brightness. But when observed, its apparent magnitude is affected by distance and extinction. But when the problem states a star's apparent magnitude, that's the observed value, which includes any extinction. So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5, with E(B-V)=0.6 → A(V)=1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude, without extinction, would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A(V) → 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's not how it's used for determining detectability. Because the problem says that for HIRES, the stars with V mag brighter than 16 can be observed. But that refers to the observed V mag, right? Because that's what you measure. Or wait, no. Maybe whether the star is detected depends on its apparent magnitude as observed, including extinction.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express this.

When a star is observed, its apparent magnitude is what you measure, which includes any extinction. So if a star's apparent magnitude (what you observe) is 15.5, and without extinction it would be 13.64, but you see it as 15.5. So whether it's detectable depends on that observed magnitude.

So for HIRES, which can observe up to 16, an apparent magnitude of 15.5 is within the limit. So Star3's m_observed is 15.5, so HIRES can detect it. ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so also yes. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, that's a different conclusion than before. So I think I made a mistake earlier because I incorrectly added the extinction to the apparent magnitude. But no, the star's apparent magnitude already includes the extinction. So the observed V mag is 15.5, which is the value to consider.

Wait, no! Let me think again. The problem says "apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." So Star2's m is 16.5, so it's already observed value. But for Star3, it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag..."

Wait, that's the problem. So Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but how does that relate to extinction? Wait, apparent magnitude is what you observe, so if the star is behind dust, it would have higher apparent magnitude. So the E(B-V) is given, and the A(V) is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_true + A(V). Wait, no. If the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true, then the observed m_obs would be m_true + A(V), since extinction makes it appear dimmer. So if the problem states that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, that includes the extinction. So the intrinsic m_true would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But the observed m is 15.5, which is what matters for detectability.

Wait, no, the problem says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So that's the observed value, already including the extinction. So when considering detectability, we don't need to correct for extinction again. Because the V mag given is the one that's observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic one, and we have to calculate the observed one. But the way the problem is written is confusing.

Wait, the problem says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Ah, so Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's without considering extinction? Or including? Wait, no, that's ambiguous. Because if it's the observed apparent magnitude, then extinction is included. But if E(B-V) is given, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic (unreddened) apparent magnitude.

Wait, this is a point of confusion. Let me try to think: The apparent magnitude you observe is affected by extinction. So if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude of 15.5, but due to extinction, it would appear fainter. So the observed apparent magnitude would be 15.5 + A(V).

So in Star3's case, if the apparent magnitude given is 15.5, that might be the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. So to find the intrinsic magnitude, it would be 15.5 - A(V). But in any case, the observed m is 15.5, so for detectability, that's what matters.

Wait, but the problem says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and then gives E(B-V)=0.6. So that suggests that the 15.5 is the observed magnitude. So that's what matters for detection. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both HIRES and ESPRESSO's limits. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-analyze each star with this in mind.

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction. So both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5, which is above HIRES's limit. So only ESPRESSO can detect.

Star3: m=15.5, so both can detect.

Star4: m_true =15.5, E(B-V)=0.4 → A(V)=1.24 → observed m=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So HIRES can't detect (needs ≤16), but ESPRESSO can (≤17).

Star5: m=15.0, no extinction. Both can detect.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, no. Let me go back. For Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, which includes A(V)=1.86. So m_observed=15.5.

Wait, no. If the apparent V is 15.5, that's the observed value. So the extinction doesn't affect it. So the star's observed V mag is 15.5, which is what matters for detectability. So Star3 can be detected by both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are:

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So the possible pairs would be among these.

Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, so no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both. So option B would be correct.

Wait, option B is Star3 and Star5. So according to this, Star3 can be detected by both because its observed m is 15.5, which is within the limits.

But earlier, I thought that Star3's observed m is 17.36, but that was a mistake because I added the extinction to the true apparent magnitude, assuming that 15.5 was the true one. But the problem says the apparent magnitude is 15.5, so perhaps that's the observed value, already accounting for extinction. So in that case, Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem states for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag."

That suggests that the apparent V is 15.5, and the E(B-V) is 0.6, which is the reddening. So the observed m is 15.5. But the true m (without extinction) would be m_true = m_observed - A(V) → 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that doesn't affect whether the star is detectable, because the observed m is 15.5. So for detectability, m_obs is the determining factor.

So with that, Star3's m=15.5 is acceptable for both.

Thus, the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5 → both would be acceptable.

Option D is Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m is 16.74, so no.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested that Star3's m_observed is 17.36, but that was under the assumption that 15.5 was the intrinsic apparent magnitude. So the confusion arises from whether the given apparent magnitude already includes the extinction.

The problem states for Star3: apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed m is 15.5. So no need to adjust for extinction again, because that's already included.

Therefore, Star3 can be detected by both.

So the correct answer would be stars 3 and 5, which is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. A star must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

   - Distance: 10 pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5 \)  
   - Extinction: None (no \( E(B-V) \) given).

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: 15.5 mag  
   - \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), so \( A(V) = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.86 \).

   - \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A(V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed V magnitude: \( m_{\text{observed}} = m + A(V) = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (\( \leq 17 \)): **Yes**.  
   - Detectable by HIRES (\( \leq 16 \)): **No**.

5. **Star5**:

   - Distance: 5 pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - Extinction: None (no \( E(B-V) \) given).  
   - Observed V magnitude: 15.0.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO (\( \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( \leq 16 \)): **Yes**.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, the correct pair is **Star3 and Star5**.

**Answer: B**
