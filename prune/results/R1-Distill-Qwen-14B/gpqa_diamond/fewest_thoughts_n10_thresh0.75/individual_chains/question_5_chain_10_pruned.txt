Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, I remember from my notes that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are crucial in quantum mechanics because they represent the possible outcomes and states of a system upon measurement.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The direction n is in the x-z plane, so the vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). I think the operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator along the direction n would be P = nx Px + nz Pz. Since Py isn't involved here (because the direction is in x-z plane, so no y-component), that makes things a bit simpler.

Wait, but wait. The question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z. So the actual operator whose eigenvector we're seeking is P · n, which is nx P_x + nz P_z.

The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.

Let me write down the matrices for each component. 

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1],[1, 0]]. So as a matrix, that's:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Similarly, Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0],[0, -1]], so it's:

[ ħ/2   0   ]
[ 0   -ħ/2 ]

And Py is given, but since direction is in x-z, we don't need Py.

So the operator P · n would be nx * Px + nz * Pz.

So let me compute that matrix:

nx * [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] + nz * [[ħ/2, 0], [0, -ħ/2]]

Which becomes:

[ nx*(0) + nz*(ħ/2), nx*(ħ/2) + nz*0 ]
[ nx*(ħ/2) + nz*0, nx*(0) + nz*(-ħ/2) ]

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, each component of the matrix is scaled by the respective nx and nz. Let me correct that.

Each matrix element is computed as:

(nx * (matrix element of Px) ) + (nz * (matrix element of Pz) )

So for the (1,1) element: 0 * nx * (ħ/2) + (1) * nz * (ħ/2) → (nz ħ/2)

Similarly, (1,2) element: (1) * nx * (ħ/2) + (0) → (nx ħ/2)

(2,1) same as (1,2): nx ħ/2

(2,2) is 0 * nx * (ħ/2) + (-1)*nz*(ħ/2) → (-nz ħ/2)

So the matrix P·n is:

[ (nz ħ/2)   (nx ħ/2) ]
[ (nx ħ/2)   (-nz ħ/2) ]

Let me factor out ħ/2 for simplicity:

(ħ/2) * [ nz    nx ]
        [ nx   -nz ]

So the operator is (ħ/2) times that matrix. Let's denote the matrix part as M:

M = [ nz, nx ]
        [ nx, -nz ]

So the operator is (ħ/2) * M.

We're looking for eigenvectors of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) * M ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

(ħ/2) M |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

M |v> = |v>

So the matrix M must have an eigenvector |v> with eigenvalue 1.

So the equation is:

M |v> = |v>

Which can be written as:

(M - I) |v> = 0 

Where I is the identity matrix.

So (M - I) is:

[nz - 1,   nx    ]
[ nx    , -nz -1 ]

Wait, no. Let's compute M - I:

M has elements (nz, nx; nx, -nz). So subtracting identity matrix I which is [[1,0],[0,1]], so each diagonal element is subtracted by 1.

So:

M - I = [nz -1, nx     ]
        [nx    , -nz -1 ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute the determinant:

(nz -1)(-nz -1) - nx^2 = 0

Let me compute this:

= (-nz)(nz -1) -1*(nz -1) - nx^2

Wait, perhaps expanding it:

(nz -1)(-nz -1) = (-nz)(nz) + (-nz)(-1) + (-1)(nz) + (-1)(-1)
= -nz² + nz - nz + 1
= -nz² + 0nz +1 = 1 - nz²

So determinant is (1 - nz²) - nx^2 = 0

Which simplifies to 1 - nz² - nx^2 = 0. But since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1. So 1 - (nz² + nx^2) = 1-1=0. So indeed, determinant is zero, which makes sense because the eigenvalue 1 exists.

So the eigenvector equation becomes:

(nz -1) v1 + nx v2 = 0
nx v1 + (-nz -1) v2 =0

So from the first equation:

(nz -1) v1 = - nx v2 → v1 = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] v2

Let me write v1 in terms of v2.

But let's think about the direction vector n being in x-z plane. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and it's a unit vector, so nx² + nz² =1.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to parameterize n in terms of spherical coordinates. Let me say that n makes an angle θ with the z-axis. Then:

nx = sinθ cosφ (but wait, no, since it's in x-z plane, φ=0 or π. Wait, no, wait: the direction is in x-z plane, but the actual direction could have any φ in the x-z plane, which is the same as φ=0 or something else. Wait, no, in x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0 or π
