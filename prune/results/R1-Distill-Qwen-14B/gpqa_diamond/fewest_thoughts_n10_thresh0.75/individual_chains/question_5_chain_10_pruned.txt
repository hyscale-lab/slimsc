Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what it's asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Right, for an operator, the eigenvector equation is P|ψ> = λ|ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. But wait, in this case, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because the operator is a vector operator, it's along some direction, say, θ from the x-axis and φ from the z-axis. But since n is in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, I think. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented with polar coordinates where θ is measured from the x-axis and φ is 0 or π. So any direction in x-z would have φ=0 or π. So the direction vector n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the position vector is (r, θ, φ), where θ is the polar angle (from z-axis) and φ the azimuthal angle. But the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane, which would imply φ=0 or π, because in the x-z plane, you don't have any y-component. So direction vector n would be (n_x, 0, n_z), but since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1.

Wait, but the operator P is along direction n. So the operator should be P · n, which is the component of P along n. But wait, in the question, they give me the x, y, z components of P. I think the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator along n would be P_n = P · n, which is n_x P_x + n
