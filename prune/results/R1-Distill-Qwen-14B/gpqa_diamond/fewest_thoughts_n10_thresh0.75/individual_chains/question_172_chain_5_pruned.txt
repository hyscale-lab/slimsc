Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The question states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J. And we're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system to the temperature. The equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the energy levels, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote star_1 as having the higher excitation, so n_1 is twice n_2. So n_1/n_2 = 2. I think that's the ratio of the populations. But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, maybe n1 (for the excited state) is twice n2 (for the same state in star_2) or the other way around? Oh, wait, star_1 has higher excitation, so for the same transition (same energy levels), n1_upper / n1_lower would be higher than n2_upper / n2_lower. But I think the question is comparing the same energy levels in both stars. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). No, wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the ratio of the excitation in each star.

Let me simplify. Let's say the energy levels are E_upper and E_lower, with E_upper > E_lower. The excitation is the population in E_upper relative to E_lower. So for star_1, (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower). Or is it that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2, meaning their excitation ratio is higher. So the ratio of n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

But wait, I think in the question, it's said that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, perhaps the excitation parameter (like excitation potential) isn't the same. Alternatively, the ratio of the populations between the two energy levels is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

The Boltzmann equation says that (n_upper/n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Since the question doesn't mention the statistical weights, I'm going to assume that g_upper/g_lower is the same for both stars, so when I take the ratio between star_1 and star_2, this factor will cancel out.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = (gU/gL) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
Similarly, R2 = (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = (gU/gL) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Given that R1 = 2 * R2, substituting:

(gU/gL) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (gU/gL) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

The (gU/gL) terms cancel out, so:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k) and 1/(T):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ?

Wait, actually, let's compute the left side correctly.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So,

(ΔE / (k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but I can rearrange this equation to get a relation between T1 and T2.

Alternatively, let me factor it another way.

Let me rewrite the equation:

[ΔE/(k)] * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But wait, I can factor out a negative sign:

[ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the equation is:

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, wait, no: because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes, correct.

So,

(ΔE / k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the equation is (ΔE/(k)) [1/T2 -1/T1] = ln(2), which is (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, which option matches this equation?

Let me see the options.

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, in our equation, we have (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ] = ln(2)

Which would mean that [ (T1 - T2) ]/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But none of the options directly show this. However, the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps I should rearrange the equation without the constants, assuming that in the equation, the ratio is such that the other terms are considered.

Wait another approach: perhaps the question is using the ratio of the populations, so I can take the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Let me think again. The ratio R1/R2 = 2.

R1 = (gU/gL
