Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it carefully.

So the situation is that we have a small synthetic peptidic compound. Its 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected. So, same molecular weight, same structure? But why the double peaks?

Hmm. Let's think about possible causes. The NMR has duplicate alpha-proton signals. So what could cause that? Maybe if the proton is split in some way. But wait, the coupling can't be the reason since they ruled that out. So perhaps it's something else causing two signals for the same proton.

In LC-MS, same mass suggests the same molecular formula. So same compound, but maybe different configurations or other isomerism.

Wait, the options are: A) Contaminated with precursor, B) Enantiomers, C) Double coupling in amide bond, D) Diastereoisomers.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But then the NMR would show peaks for both the product and the precursor, but the question says the NMR is consistent except for two peaks of the same alpha-proton. Plus, the LC-MS shows two peaks of the same mass; a precursor would have a different mass, so that's probably not it.

Option B: Enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they would have identical NMR spectra because they're symmetrical. So if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would look the same. But here, the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Wait, no, enantiomers would give the same NMR, so why two peaks? Maybe not B.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure what that means. Maybe during the reaction, some coupling leads to two different structures. But if it's a synthetic issue, perhaps some side product. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so same molecular weight, so same compound. Not sure.

Option D
