Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Okay, the problem is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a volume and pH value.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, which is a base. So when you add a strong acid to it, they should react, right? The acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH- ions, but wait, in this case, the acid is a monobasic strong acid, like HCl or HNO3. 

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid would be something like:
Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, I think I'll need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 first. To find moles, I need the molar mass. Let me calculate that.

Fe has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be Fe + 3(OH). Each OH is 17 g/mol (16+1). So total molar mass would be 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me double-check that calculation: 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles.

Now, each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions, right? Because the reaction equation shows 3 H+ ions reacting with each Fe(OH)3. So the moles of H+ needed will be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So H+ needed = 0.000936 * 3 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

But wait, the strong acid is monobasic, so one mole of acid provides one mole of H+. Therefore, the moles of acid needed are the same as the moles of H+ required.

So moles of acid = 0.002808 mol. 

The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M, which is moles per liter. We're dealing with volume in cm³, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So, to find the volume, I can use the formula:

Volume (L) = moles / concentration.

So Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L. To convert to cm³, multiply by 1000: 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. That's very close, probably due to rounding. So the volume needed is approximately 28.08 cm³, so option C or B maybe? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in moles. Let me recalculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 more accurately. Fe is 55.845 g/mol, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol. 

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.869 ≈ 0.0009357 mol. Multiply by 3 gives 0.002807 moles of H+ needed. So the volume is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L → 28.07 cm³. So about 28.07, which rounds to 28.05 or 2
