Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because of this, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as these spots do, given that the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. Right, so I think I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find what planet size would cause the same variation.

Wait, so the key here is comparing the relative change in brightness when the spots are visible (and when they're not). Then, a planet transiting would block some light, causing a dip in brightness. So, the amplitude of this dip would depend on the planet's size relative to the star.

First, I should find the amplitude caused by the spots. Then, find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

But wait, the spots are causing a dip in brightness because they are cooler and darker, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the star's brightness drop, and then when the other side comes into view, it brightens again.

So, the total brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star.

The star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, so the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So, the filling factor is 0.2, but it's only on one hemisphere. So, the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. Because the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is half the surface. So if the filling factor is 20%, that would mean 0.2 of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. And since only one hemisphere is covered, the spots are on half the surface. So, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 4πR^2.

Wait, no, the area of a sphere is 4πR². So, if the spots cover 20% of the entire surface, that's 0.2 * 4πR². But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Oh, wait, no, maybe the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. Let me read the question again.

"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, okay, so the filling factor is
