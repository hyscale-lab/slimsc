Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations due to spots can mimic an exoplanet. The goal is to find out what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness change as the spotted star. 

Hmm, so the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar is R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered in spots, right? So 20% of the hemisphere's surface is spots. 

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Oh wait, no, the temperature difference is 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots are at 5000 K? Because 6000 - 1000 is 5000? Or is it 6000 + 1000? Wait, the star's Teff is 6000, and the spots are cooler, right? Because dark spots are cooler. So spots are 5000 K.

Photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into and out of view. The question says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet. So when the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer, and when they're not, it's brighter. But if you didn't have the spots, what exoplanet radius would cause the same dip in brightness.

Wait, the problem says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve." So the dip in brightness from the planet blocking the star would be the same as the dip from the spots. So I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and set that equal to the fractional change caused by the planet, then solve for Rplanet/Rstar.

Let me think about the formulas involved. The change in brightness (delta F) when a spot is observed depends on the area of the spot and the temperature difference.
