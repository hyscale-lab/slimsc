Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The possible answer choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it's a low-energy approximation that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added in a way that respects the symmetries of the SM. So the operators in SMEFT must preserve the same symmetries as the SM.

Wait, what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? The SM has Lorentz symmetry, which includes the Poincaré group because Poincaré is about translations and Lorentz transformations. Oh right, Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So any operator in the SM must respect both, so SMEFT should as well.

CP symmetry — I think the SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but some of its particles have CP issues. Wait, no, the SM has CP symmetry but it's not necessarily respected. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the SM. Wait, no, maybe not. SMEFT is built by adding operators that preserve the symmetries of the SM. So all the operators must be compatible with the SM's symmetries, which include Lorentz, gauge (like SU(2), SU(3)), and possibly others.

Wait, but do the operators in SMEFT have to respect CP symmetry? Because the SM doesn't have a CP symmetry that's exact, right? Or wait, the SM as a theory has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT might not necessarily respect CP, but perhaps the effective theory is written in a way that respects all the original symmetries except for those broken by the new physics. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, think again. The SMEFT is built by considering all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM. So any operator added must be invariant under the SM's gauge group (like SU(2), SU(3), U(1)) as well as Lorentz symmetry. But what about other symmetries like CP and CPT?

CPT symmetry is
