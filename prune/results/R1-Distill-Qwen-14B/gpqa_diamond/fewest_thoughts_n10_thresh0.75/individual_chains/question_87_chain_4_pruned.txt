Okay, so I have this question about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

The question says the compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Oh wait, di-substituted means two substituents, each adding some carbons. So, for example, each substituent could be -OCH3 (which would be one substituent but adds a carbon), but wait, that's only 7. Wait no, the total is 8.

Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents add 2 more. So each substituent has one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and another has none? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. So perhaps each substituent has one carbon, like two -CH3 groups? Or one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester?

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, right! So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (like Cl, Br, I) and a carbonyl group. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like an acetyl group, but wait, that would be a substituent like -COCH3.

Wait, but wait: if the ring is di-substituted, then two substituents are present. So perhaps one substituent is a halogen (like Cl) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl (COCH3). Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a nitro group, but no, the IR says carbonyl, so probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.

Wait, but let's count the carbons. The benzene is 6, substituents add 2 more. So each substituent is a single carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons. Let's think: for example, a halogen is one substituent (like Cl, which is a single atom
