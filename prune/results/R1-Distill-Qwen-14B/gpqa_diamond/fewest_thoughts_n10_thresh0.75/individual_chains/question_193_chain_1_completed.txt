Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm not exactly sure about the details.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, that's the same as N ∝ plx^-5. Right. Now, I need to find out how the number of stars (probably per unit volume or per some range) changes with distance r.

I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, but wait, in astronomy, the parallax is usually in arcseconds, and distance is in parsecs. So the formula is plx (in arcsec) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. Therefore, plx is inversely proportional to distance.

So if I have N proportional to plx^(-5), and plx is proportional to 1/d, then substituting, N is proportional to (1/d)^-5. Because plx = 1/d, so plx^(-5) = (1/d)^(-5) = d^5. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my substitution again.

Wait, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 means N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/d, substituting, we get N = k * (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm, so maybe it's about the number per unit distance, like the density.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. Because the number of stars in a region of the sky would depend on the volume, which depends on distance.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars observed with a certain parallax would depend on how many stars are within a certain distance. So maybe the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be proportional to the surface area times the thickness, but considering the selection function based on parallax.

Wait, but the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So as plx decreases (since plx is smaller for more distant stars), the number of stars increases. Wait, no: 1/plx^5 implies that when plx is small (distance is large), 1/plx^5 becomes very big. So the number of stars increases as distance increases? That doesn't make sense, because we should have more stars in the nearby regions, since it's easier to see them. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the data is that the number of stars in a certain region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So for a given region, as parallax decreases (so distance increases), the number of stars in that region increases as 1/(plx)^5. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps this is about how many stars are observable beyond a certain distance. Or maybe it's considering all stars within a certain parallax range. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. Since parallax (p) is 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if I have a parallax of p, the distance is d = 1/p.

The question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance (r). The options are about the dependence on r, like N ∝ r^something.

Given N ∝ 1/p^5, and p = 1/r (assuming r is in parsecs, same as d), then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But wait, that can't be right because as r increases, the volume increases, but the number of stars in a volume would depend on the density of stars. If the density is uniform, the number would be proportional to volume, which is r^3. But perhaps the question is considering something else.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, not per volume. Let's consider that.

If the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr is given by N ∝ 4πr² * (number density), but I think that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars per unit distance (like a differential change) is being considered.

Wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So perhaps it's the number per unit distance, dN/dr. So if N ∝ r^something, then dN/dr would be proportional to r^(something-1).

Wait, but let me go back. The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/p^5. Since p = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. Therefore, as r increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of r. So the number of stars would be going up rapidly with distance.

But that doesn't make sense because, in reality, beyond a certain distance, you can't see more stars because of extinction and the distribution of stars. Maybe this is a hypothetical scenario.

So, the problem is about the relationship between N and r, given N ∝ 1/p^5, and p = 1/r. So substituting, N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5.

But the options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So the correct answer would be option B, which is r^5.

Wait a second, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because when you're farther away, you can see more stars in a region, but not as many as a fifth power. But perhaps the selection function is such that the number is going up with r^5.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number density. Because number density (number per unit volume) would decrease with distance, but that's not what the question is asking.

But the question says the number of stars varies as 1/p^5. So N = k / p^5. Since p is 1/r, then N = k r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

So the answer is B.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this relationship into the given proportionality, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \implies N \propto r^5
\]

This means the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance. The options provided are:

- **A)** \( \sim r^3 \)
- **B)** \( \sim r^5 \)
- **C)** \( \sim r^4 \)
- **D)** \( \sim r^2 \)

From the analysis, the correct dependence is \( N \propto r^5 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
