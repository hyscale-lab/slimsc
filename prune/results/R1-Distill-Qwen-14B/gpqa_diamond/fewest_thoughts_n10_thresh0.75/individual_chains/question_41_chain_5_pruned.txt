Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. So, the setup is that a light beam is moving through a glass slab, which itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. And the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab. The glass has an index of refraction n. We need to find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, in a vacuum, the speed of light is c, which is given as 1 here. But when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed is 1/n. But what happens when the medium itself is moving?

Hmm, I remember something about how velocities don't just add up simply when dealing with light because of relativity. Oh wait, but this is a classical mechanics problem, I think, because the options don't involve anything relativistically corrected. Or maybe they do? I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at a velocity v towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the beam is moving through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving. So
