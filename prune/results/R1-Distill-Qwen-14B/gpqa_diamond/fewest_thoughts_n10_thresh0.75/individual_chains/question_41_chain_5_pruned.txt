Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the setup is that a glass has an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. The question is about the speed of light in the glass as seen by someone in the lab.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially involving light, things get tricky because of relativity. But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Oh wait, no, wait. The speed of light in a medium is different. Like, in glass, it's c/n, but that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed of light measured in the lab frame?

Let me think about reference frames. If the glass is moving, then the observer in the lab is in a different frame from someone on the glass. But light's speed isn't just additive like other velocities. Oh wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly because of the way velocities transform between frames.

Wait, but the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. Oh, but the light here is in glass, so its speed is c/n in the rest frame of the glass. So in the glass's frame, the speed is c/n. But then the glass is moving at velocity v relative
