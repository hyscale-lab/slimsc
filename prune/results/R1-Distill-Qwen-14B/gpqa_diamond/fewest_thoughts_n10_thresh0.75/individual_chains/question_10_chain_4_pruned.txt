Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities, and I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me start by going through each option one by one and see what I can figure out.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are labeled A to D, each corresponding to one of the options. Let me read the options again.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, so this one would have the same density as Earth. But wait, the question is about which is the highest, so I need to compare others.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Hmm, so its density is given as the same as Earth's. So at first glance, same as a. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question is which has the highest density. So if b's density is 5.5, same as Earth, but the mass is higher, does that affect the density? No, because density is mass over volume, and for a planet, it's about the average density. So if mass is 2 Earth masses but density is 5.5, which is same as Earth, then its radius must be different. So Earth's mass is M, radius R. The volume is (4/3)πR³. So if mass is 2M, density is 2M / [(4/3)π(R')³] =5.5. So I can figure out R' from that. But perhaps the radius isn't as important for the question because the density is given. So for option b, density is 5.5, same as Earth. So I can note that.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. So same composition as Earth, which would mean same density. Wait, wait, no. Wait, same composition implies same density? Because density is determined by the material. So if it's same composition, same density. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet would have the same density. But the mass is five times Earth's. But that would mean the radius is larger because mass scales with radius cubed if density is same. So M = (4/3)π R³ * density. So if M is 5x
