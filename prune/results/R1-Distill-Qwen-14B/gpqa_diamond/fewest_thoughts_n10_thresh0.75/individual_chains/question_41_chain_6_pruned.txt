Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is: A light beam is moving through a glass with refractive index n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction. So, the glass's motion is adding to the light's direction. Interesting. But how does that affect the speed of light in the medium?

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. Oh, but here the medium (glass) is moving. So I guess we need to consider relativistic effects because velocities add in a particular way when objects are moving relative to each other.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the glass is a material medium, not another inertial frame in the sense of special relativity. Or am I mixing things up? Hmm. Let me think again.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n, right? Because when a medium is stationary, the light's speed is c/n. So in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, I need to find the speed of the light according to the lab observer.

Wait, but how do velocities add in this context. Let's clarify: when you have an object moving at velocity u in a frame S, and another object moving at velocity v in that same frame, their relative velocity is not simply u + v. That's only true if they're moving in the same direction and you're applying the Galilean transformation, but that's only accurate at non-relativistic speeds. Since light speed is involved, maybe we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

But wait, is the glass moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light in the glass would be the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's frame) plus the glass's velocity, but adjusted for relativity.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, the speed of the light in the glass's frame is c/n, which is less than c. So let me plug that into the formula.

Wait, no, wait a second. The frame S is the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in S. Inside the glass, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. But wait, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. So what would the speed of light be in the lab frame?

So using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u + v) / [1 + (u v)/c²].

Wait, but u is the velocity of the light as observed from the glass's frame. So u = c/n.

So substituting, u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / [1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c²
