Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in glass relative to an observer when the glass itself is moving.

Right, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which here is given as 1. So in the glass, the speed is 1/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer.

But in this case, the glass itself is moving. So how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light within it? I'm a bit confused because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but this is about light inside a moving medium, so maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler effect or how velocities add in different frames. Or perhaps it's a problem about relative velocity addition without involving relativity, since the velocity v is probably non-relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of the light within the glass is 1/n as measured in the glass's rest frame, but when the glass is moving, what's the observed speed in the lab frame?

Wait,
