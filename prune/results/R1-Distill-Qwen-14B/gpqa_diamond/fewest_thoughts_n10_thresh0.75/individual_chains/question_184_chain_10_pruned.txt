Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That's a mouthful. Let me break down the structure to understand where each substituent should go.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group, a nitro group, and a tert-butyl group. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and the nitro at position 3. Wait, no—I think I got that wrong. Wait, in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but the numbering should give the lowest possible numbers. Let me think: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So positions 1, 2, 3 on the ring.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so the positions might be arranged in a way that substituents are adjacent? Hmm. Alternatively, it's that the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions in a meta arrangement? Wait, no—if it’s 1,2,3 positions, that's adjacent in a row, like a propyl arrangement. But benzene doesn't have a linear structure, so perhaps it's a meta arrangement? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and the nitro at position 3. That would mean the substituents are all adjacent in a row. But wait, in benzene, that would imply a vicinal arrangement, but benzene is cyclic, so position 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent in a meta-like fashion. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in a 1,2,3 manner around the ring. So in any case, the substituents are all on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent to each other in a row. So the substituents are in a sort of 1, 2, 3 positions in a way that each is next to the other.

Now, the challenge is to figure out the sequence of reactions to get those substituents onto the benzene ring in the correct positions. Since we're starting with benzene, we'll be doing electrophilic substitution reactions, probably in a certain order to get the substituents where we want them.

But wait, the substituents are ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl. Now, let's think about the directing effects of each group. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating (since it's an alkyl group), ortho/para-directing group. But wait, tert-butyl is a strong activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl substituent.

Wait, but substituents that are deactivating (like nitro) would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But the order in which we add substituents will affect where the new groups attach.

So the target has three substituents: ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl. Let's think about their positions. Let me sketch a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

But perhaps it's better to think about the order of adding substituents. Let me plan the possible steps.

Optionally, which substituent should be added first to direct the next substituents correctly?

One common approach is to add the groups in the order of their deactivating effects. Since nitro is deactivating, maybe it's best added after the other groups. Alternatively, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group is an activating group, so it can be a good director. Let me think about the order of adding substituents.

Suppose we start by adding the tert-butyl group first. Then, since tert-butyl is a strong activating group, the next substitution can be directed by it.

Wait, but the ethoxy group is also activating. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can add nitro last because it's a strong deactivator, so it might complicate the directing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to add nitro later, but wait, nitro is a meta director, so if I add it after ethoxy, which is ortho/
