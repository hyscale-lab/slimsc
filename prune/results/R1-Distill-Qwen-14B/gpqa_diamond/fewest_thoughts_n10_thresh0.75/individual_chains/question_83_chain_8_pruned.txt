Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, first, the scenario: We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, with various pairs of pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its dissociation increases because of the dilution effect. So first, I'll need to find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution after adding water.

Let me think: the initial volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. When we add another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration of acetic acid can be calculated using dilution formula, C1V1 = C2V2.

C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. C2 is what we're looking for, and V2 is 0.04 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = C2 * 0.04. That gives C2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that.

0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles. Divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. Oh, right, that's correct. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, we're dealing with a weak acid and a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions.

Wait, but how much NaOH are we adding at 25% titration? Let's figure that out. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001.

Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach 25% titration would involve 0.25 * 0.001 mol of NaOH, which is 0.00025 mol. So the volume of NaOH is (0.00025 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. But wait, maybe I need this for the buffer solution calculation.

But perhaps another approach is better. At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and acetate ions. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, let's go step by step.

First, let's calculate the initial moles after dilution.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

Now, when titrating, each mole of NaOH will neutralize one mole of CH3COOH, forming CH3COO^-.

At 25% titration: 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles reacted = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, since we're adding 25% of the required NaOH, the total volume of the solution will now be the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH
