Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, first, I should figure out the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2.

Wait, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³ because we added another 20 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40? Wait, no, 0.05 *20 is 1. 1 divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration mean? I think it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So first, let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The 25% titration refers to the point where 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. So if we have 0.001 mol of acetic acid, 25% of that is 0.00025 mol reacted. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.00025 mol. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but the initial solution is 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH would make the total volume 42.5 cm³. But maybe I can approach the problem by considering the dilution and the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of concentrations and the buffer solution.

At 25% titration, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, sodium acetate. So, let's find the concentrations.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol has reacted. So, the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- (from NaOH) are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentration of CH3COOH is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. The concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, that's about 4.26. So the pH at 25% is around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate comes from the moles divided by the total volume.

At equivalence, we added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. Which matches the moles of acetic acid, so all of it is neutralized.

The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate acts as a base. The reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's use the approximation for weak bases. The Kb is small, so x will be
