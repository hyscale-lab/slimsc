Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and we have some data about its orbit. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events.

Hmm, wait. Transit and occultation events. Oh right, a transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light (if it emits any) is blocked. But for the planet to cause an occultation, it must be larger than the star, or wait, no, occultation is when the planet is hidden by the star. So the planet must pass behind the star. So for that to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that sometimes it is on the same side as the star from our perspective, allowing it to pass behind.

Wait, but in our solar system, the planets are all in the same orbital plane, more or less. So for the second planet to have both transit and occultation, it must be in the same orbital plane as the first planet, which they said they share.

But how does the orbital period tie into this? I think the key here is about the orbital periods and whether their periods are in a ratio that allows them to sometimes align for transit and occultation.

Wait, no. Another thought: if the two planets are in the same orbital plane, their orbital periods must be such that they can both pass in front and behind each other relative to the star. So for the second planet to cause a transit, it must be closer to the star than the first planet, because it needs to pass in front. Alternatively, maybe the other way around.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a planet transits, it's because it's between us and the star. So for a second planet to transit, it must be closer to the star than the first planet. Because if it's farther, the first planet would be closer, so it's more likely to transit. Wait, no, perhaps not necessarily. Wait, maybe it's more about the relative positions.

But wait, the first planet is transiting, so we know that its orbital period is 3 days. So the problem is about the second planet's period. We need to find the maximum possible period such that the second planet can both transit and be occulted.

Wait, occultation happens when the planet passes behind the star. So for that to happen, the planet must be farther from the star than the star's radius. Wait, no, let me think. The star's radius is given, but for an occultation, the planet must be in a position where it can be hidden by the star. That would mean that when the planet is behind the star from our perspective, we stop seeing its reflected light or its own light if it emits. So the planet's orbit must be such that it can sometimes be directly behind the star relative to us.

Hmm,
