Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. They're asking for the mean decay distance. The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's about the distance the particle travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh right, because the width Γ is related to the inverse lifetime. But wait, the width is given in MeV, so I'll need to convert that into energy units. Oh, but maybe I can work in natural units first and then convert to meters.

Wait, natural units where ħ = c = 1, but when we calculate proper distance, we need to convert units. So the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. Then, the mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime, right? So distance L = v * τ.

But wait, the speed v depends on the energy and mass. The particle is moving relativistically, so I should calculate its velocity using the relativistic equations. The energy E is given, mass m is known. So I can find the velocity using E = γ m c². Wait, but in natural units, E is in GeV, and mass m is in GeV/c². Hmm, this might get a bit tricky with unit conversions.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / (Γ c²). Wait, no, I think in natural units, Γ is in energy, and τ is in seconds. So I should convert Γ into units compatible with ħ.

Wait, ħ has units of GeV·s when we use GeV for energy. So let me think: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ is ħ (in GeV·s) divided by Γ (GeV), which gives seconds.

Wait, but in the problem, Γ is given as 320 MeV. So I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ let me calculate that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds. But wait, I should probably be precise. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.

Next, calculate the velocity v of the particle. Since E is given as 8 GeV and mass is 1.2 GeV/c², I can find the Lorentz factor gamma.

E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But in natural units, c=1, so E = γ m. So gamma is E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.666
