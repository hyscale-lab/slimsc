Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. They've given me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Hmm, I remember that decay properties are related to something called the mean lifetime, and from that, you can get the mean decay distance. But wait, how exactly do I connect all these together?

First, let's recall some basic formulas. The mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its width Γ by the equation τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check that. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle, the width Γ (which is the uncertainty in energy) multiplied by the lifetime τ (the uncertainty in time) is about ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ = ħ / Γ. Got it.

Once I have the mean lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance. The decay distance (L) is the product of the velocity (v) of the particle and the mean lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ. But wait
