Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question is about an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. Oh wait, wait, because of relativity, right? So time dilation comes into play here.

Wait, so I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of someone not moving (like Earth observers). But from the astronaut's viewpoint, the distance to Earth would be shorter because of length contraction. So the time measured by the astronaut would be less than what an Earth observer would calculate.

Hmm, but the problem says to find the time from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to calculate the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

First, I think I should calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but the problem doesn't give specific distances, so maybe it's a standard problem where the distance is known? Oh wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the distance isn't necessary because the speed is so high that the time is effectively calculated with time dilation.

Wait, no, wait. The problem mentions that the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So, the astronaut is 22 now. So even if the trip takes, say, 100 years from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would age only a little because of time dilation. So the question is, would the trip take longer than the astronaut's lifespan? Or not?

Wait, the options include an option where the astronaut dies before reaching Earth (option A). So perhaps without considering relativity, the trip would take too long. But with relativity, it's shorter, so maybe the astronaut would live long enough.

But wait, the astronaut's own time is the proper time, so we need to calculate that.

The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 - v squared over c squared). But wait, for very high velocities, gamma becomes very large.

But wait, the
