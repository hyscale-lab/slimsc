Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. But wait, the formula is actually plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d.

Now the problem says N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So 1/plx^5 would be 1/( (1/d)^5 ) which is d^5. So wait, N is proportional to d^5? Or wait, no, let me think. If plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance. But wait, the number of stars as a function of distance. Oh, but wait, wait, no. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range
