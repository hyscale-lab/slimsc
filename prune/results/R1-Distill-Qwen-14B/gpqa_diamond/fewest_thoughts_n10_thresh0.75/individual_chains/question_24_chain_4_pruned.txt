Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. I'll start by reading the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question talks about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, implying it's a saturated molecule. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds.

Hmm. So let's break this down.

First, the initial mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means it's reacting with it, probably via addition. So X could have alkenes or something that reacts with bromine. For example, alkenes can undergo addition reactions with bromine.

Then, X is treated with platinum and heated. Platinum is a catalyst, often for hydrogenation or other addition reactions. The product is Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y doesn't have the same kind of reactive groups as X. 

Hydrogenation of X and Y under severe conditions gives Z, a hydrocarbon. Since both X and Y give the same Z, Z must be a more reduced form of both. Since Z is a product of hydrogenation, perhaps it's fully saturated. Also, Z has 14.28% hydrogen by mass.

Wait, let's calculate the molecular formula for Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7, because 14.28 is roughly 100/7. So, let's say the hydrogen is 1/7 of the molecule's mass.

Assume Z is CnHm. The percentage of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) *100% =14.28%. Let's see, 14.28% is 1/7, so 1/(12n +m) *m = 1/7.

So m/(12n +m) = 1/7 → 7m=12n +m →6m=12n → m=2n.

So Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene or an alkyne. Wait, but Z is obtained by hydrogenation, which suggests that Z is more saturated than the starting material. Wait, but if Z is CnH2n, that's an alkene. But hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes. So wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. If Z is the product of hydrogenation, then perhaps Z is an alkane. Because alkenes would hydrogenate to alkanes. Wait, but the calculation earlier suggests Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the math. Let's redo it properly.

Mass fraction of H is 14.28% → 0.1428. Let's assume the molecular formula is CnHm. The molar mass is 12n + m.

The mass of H is m * 1 g/mol. The total is 12n + m g/mol. So m / (12n + m) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator: m = 0.1428*(12n + m)
m = 1.714n + 0.1428m
m - 0.1428m = 1.714n
0.8572 m = 1.714 n
Divide both sides by 0.8572: m = (1.714 /0.8572) *n ≈ 2n.

So m=2n. So Z is CnH2n.

Wait, that's an alkene. So if Z is an alkene, but it's the product of hydrogenation, which adds H2 across double bonds, that would mean that Z is more hydrogenated than the starting materials. That would imply that the starting materials (X and Y) have more double bonds than Z, which doesn't make sense because hydrogenation usually reduces the number of double bonds.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If Z is formed by hydrogenation, it must be more saturated. So maybe Z is an alkane, which is CnH2n+2.

Hmm, but in that case, let's
