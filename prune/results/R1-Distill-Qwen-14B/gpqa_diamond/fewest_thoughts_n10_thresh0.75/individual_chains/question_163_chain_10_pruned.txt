Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what I need to do. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and determining the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution.

Alright, so the problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we need to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The options given are A to D, each with different pH values and volumes. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is important here. Let me calculate that. Iron (Fe) has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH group is 17.01 g/mol, and since there are three of them, that's 3 * 17.01 = 51.03 g/mol. So the total molar mass is 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol approximately.

So, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. That's 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.1 / 106.88 is approximately 0.0009357 mol. Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 106.88 times 0.0009357 is about 0.1, so yes, that's correct.

Next, Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic base, meaning it can react with three H+ ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve.

The strong acid provided is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. Therefore, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of the acid.

So the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009357 mol = 0.0028071 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which is moles per liter. We need to find the volume (in cm³) of this solution that contains 0.0028071 moles of H+.

Using the formula M = moles / volume (in liters), rearranged to volume = moles / M. So the volume is 0.0028071 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028071 liters. Converting to cm³, since 1 liter is 1000 cm³, that's 28.071 cm³. Looking at the options, option C has a volume of 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So maybe option C is the correct volume.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum volume". So yeah, because that's the exact amount needed to provide enough H+ to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. Any more would just leave excess acid, but since we're looking for the minimum, 28.07 cm³ is correct.

Now, moving on to the pH part. Once the reaction is complete, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions and excess H+ from the acid. Wait, no, because the acid is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate. But wait, when you dissolve Fe(OH)3 in acid, all the OH- will react with H+ to form water. So the solution will have Fe^3+ ions and any excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, let's think again. The moles of H+ added are 0.0028071 mol, and the Fe(OH)3 consumes 0.0028071 mol of H+ (since 3 * 0.0009357). So the moles of H+ consumed equals the moles provided, right? But wait, the total solution volume is 100 cm³, as given. So the H+ comes from both the acid and any autoionization, but in this case, since the acid is strong and in excess, the autoionization is negligible.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the moles of H+ added is exactly the same as needed for the reaction, then after the reaction, there's no excess H+ left
