Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about the flux of neutrinos from the Sun, specifically comparing two energy bands. Hmm, neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various nuclear reactions, right?

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the pp-III branch... I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun's core. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches refer to different stages in this chain. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of helium-3 into helium-4, but wait, no, I think that's the CNO cycle? No, wait, the CNO cycle is a different process. Let me think. The proton-proton chain produces deuterium in the first step, then other steps, and the pp-III branch is when two He-3 nuclei combine to form He-4. Oh wait, but that's actually part of the CNO cycle? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, I think the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain, where He-3 is produced and then combines. Wait, in the pp chain, the initial steps produce deuterium, then He-3, and then in the pp-III branch, two He-3 nuclei fuse into He-4. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, but the key point here is that the pp-III branch has stopped. So, the question is about the effect on the neutrino flux reaching Earth. Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The pp chain produces neutrinos via the beta decay of boron-8, which emits electron neutrinos. The main pp chain is the dominant source of solar neutrinos, I think.

Wait, but the pp-III branch: if it stops, how does that affect neutrino production? Let's think. In the pp-III branch, does it produce a certain type of neutrino? I believe that in the proton-proton chain, the main neutrinos come from the decay of Beryllium-7, which captures a proton to form Boron-8, which then decays into Lithium-7 plus a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, the Boron-8 decay produces neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, does
