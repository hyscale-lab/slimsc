Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring. The positions are numbered such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they are adjacent or with one position in between? Let me think: the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering the ring: position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro. So looking at the benzene ring, the substituents are in a meta arrangement, but wait, position 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row, so it's more of an ortho and meta arrangement. Hmm. So perhaps the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions in a way that they are all adjacent, but that might be a bit complicated.

Wait, actually, benzene can't have three adjacent substituents because that's not possible in a six-membered ring. Wait, no, position 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive, so in numbering, they would be in a row. But that's possible. So the ring would have substituents in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Let me see: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So they are all in a row. Thatâ€™s an interesting substitution pattern.

So the synthesis steps will involve adding these groups in the correct order, considering that each substitution affects the orientation of the next.

I know that when you perform electrophilic substitution reactions on benzene, the directing
