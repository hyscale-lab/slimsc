Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to think through each part of the question step by step.

The question has three parts: parts A, B, and C, each with different reactants. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol as the conditions. I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So, the Michael addition should happen here.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an ester where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So, the carbonyl is at position 2. The attack will occur at the beta carbon (position 3, but wait, the numbering might be different). Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? Or maybe the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 if it's acrylate. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl is on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COO-Me? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

But regardless, in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the enolate (nucleophile) from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)₂CH. When it forms an enolate, the negative charge is on the central carbon, so it can attack the beta carbon of the other compound.

So the acrylate is something like CH₂=CH–CO–OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached where? Maybe CH₂–CH(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl on carbon 2. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂–CO–OCH3 with a double bond between CH₂ and CO, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO–, so for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3? No, maybe the p-tolyl is on the third carbon of
