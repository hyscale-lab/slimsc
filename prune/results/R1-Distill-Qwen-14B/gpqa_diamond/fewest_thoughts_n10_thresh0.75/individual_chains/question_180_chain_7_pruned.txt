Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, e is the elementary charge, right? Which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 times that, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. I think that setup would form something like a sphere around P, but maybe it's not important for the energy calculation.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, so I'm guessing this has to do with the electric potential energy between these charges. Since the system is isolated, it's all about the potential energy due to their mutual charges.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so it's not moving. So the potential energy would come from the interactions between the 12 charges at 2m and the 13th, and also between the 12 charges themselves.

But wait, no. Because the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P. So the 13th charge is at P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, so their distance from the 13th charge is 2m, right?

So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Let me think. The formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since we have multiple charges, we need to calculate all the pairwise interactions.

Wait, but wait, in the system, how many interactions are there?

So, the 13 charges: 1 at P, 12 at 2m. Let's think about all possible pairs:

1. The 13th charge (
