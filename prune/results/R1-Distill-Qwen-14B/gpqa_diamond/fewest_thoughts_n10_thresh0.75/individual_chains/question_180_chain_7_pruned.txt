Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge. The system is isolated, which probably means I don't have to worry about external electric fields or anything like that. 

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where one charge is fixed, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Hmm. 

Wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since energy is minimized when the charges are in their most stable configuration, but in this case, the charges are constrained, so maybe I just need to calculate the potential energy based on their current positions.

Since all the charges are the same, I can model this as a point charge at P and 12 other point charges at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the charge at P is also 2e. 

Wait, but wait a second. The 12 charges are each 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So the fixed
