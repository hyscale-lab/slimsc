Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiral centersâ€”centers with four different substituents. But wait, I remember that there are other possibilities, like if there's a plane of symmetry or something else that might make it non-chiral despite having a stereocenter.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure-wise, that's a double bond between C1 and C2. The configuration is Z, so the higher priority groups are on the same side. Wait, but for a double bond to have geometric isomerism, you need two different groups on each carbon. Let's see: C1 has Cl and CH2CH3 (I think, since but-1-ene has CH2 on C1 and CH2CH2 on C2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, CH(CH3), and another substituent. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: so it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, 2-methyl implies a methyl branch on C2. So the structure would be Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1 has Cl, CH2CH3 (maybe?), and the double bond. Wait, maybe it's
