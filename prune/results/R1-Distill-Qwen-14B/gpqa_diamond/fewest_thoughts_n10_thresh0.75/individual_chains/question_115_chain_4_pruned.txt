Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into photons. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But wait, let me think through this carefully.

So the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two photons.

First, I should probably consider the frame of reference. Since the problem states that the electron is moving left and the positron right, but their directions are horizontal. Wait, Lorentz factors are given, so they're moving at relativistic speeds.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate. It's equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2.

But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, maybe I should consider their velocities. Let me calculate their velocities from the Lorentz factors.

For the electron:
gamma_e = 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²)
So sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²) = 1/4 → 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/16 → v_e² = c² (15/16) → v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.968 c. Since it's moving to the left, let's say its velocity is -v_e.

The positron is moving to the right, so its velocity is +v_p. Its gamma_p is 2, so:

gamma_p = 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²)
sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) = 1/2 → 1 - v_p²/c² = 1/4 → v_p² = (3/4)c² → v_p = (sqrt(3)/2)c ≈ 0.866 c.

Wait, but I need to compute their momenta and energies. Because in the annihilation, the total momentum and energy must be conserved.

So before collision, the system is composed of the electron and positron. Let's calculate the total energy and momentum.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Wait, but wait, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. Alternatively, since m_e c^2 is the rest energy, so p = gamma m_e v. But actually, another formula is p = gamma m_e v = (gamma m_e) * v. Alternatively, using E² = (pc c)² + (m_e c²)^2, so p = sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2) / c² → but E for a particle is gamma m_e c²
