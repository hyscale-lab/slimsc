Okay, so I've got this question about immunology, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves rotavirus tagged with GFP. They gave these tagged proteins to mice orally. Then they used in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid, some entangled in mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm. So the main points here are the rotavirus proteins being delivered to mice, the GFP fluorescence observed, and then looking at the variable heavy chains in the Peyer patches.

Wait, Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're structures in the small intestine that contain a lot of immune cells, especially B cells. These patches are important for immune responses to things that you take in via the gut, like oral vaccines or pathogens.

So the GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins are probably being taken up by the immune system. But some were destroyed by stomach acid or stuck in mucus. However, some made it to the Peyer patches. Once there, they probably triggered an immune response.

They isolated the proliferating cell population, which suggests they're looking at cells that are actively dividing, like activated B cells. Then, they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes. High variability in these genes suggests that each B cell has a different sequence, which is a sign of clonal expansion and diversification.

Now, thinking about the processes involved in B cell activation and antibody production. There are a few key processes here: VDJ recombination, somatic hypermutation, and class switching.

VDJ recombination happens during the early stages of B cell development in the bone marrow. It's when the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the unique B cell receptor. This happens during the generation of B cell diversity in the bone marrow, so it's part of the initial setup of each B cell's receptor.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cell is activated. This process introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of the antibody. This helps in fine-tuning the immune response for better affinity.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG or IgA), which doesn't affect the variable regions but changes the type. So that's about the class, not the variability in the variable regions.

In this question, the variable heavy chain genes show high variability which suggests that each cell has a different variable region. That's not something that happens during VDJ recombination because that's a one-time event when the B cell is formed. But during an immune response, when B cells are activated, they undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of the antibodies.

Wait, but Peyer patches are sites where antigens are sampled, and the immune response is initiated. So after the rotavirus proteins are taken up and processed, they activate B cells. These activated B cells then undergo proliferation and differentiation. During this proliferation phase, the B cells undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies, leading to a more robust immune response.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chains would be due to somatic hypermutation. That's option A.

The other options: option D (VDJ) is during B cell development in the bone marrow, not after activation. B (complement) and C (class switching) are about activation pathways and antibody types, not variable region diversity.


The question involves rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP being delivered to mice via oral gavage. These proteins are observed in Peyer patches, where the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells show high variability. Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are critical for immune responses to oral antigens. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that diversifies the antibody repertoire after B cell activation.

Key processes in B cell activation include:

1. **VDJ Recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the B cell receptor. This is a one-time event and does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chains after activation.

2. **Somatic Hypermutation**: This process introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor after activation. It increases diversity and fine-tunes the immune response, aligning with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chains.

3. **Class Switching Recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variability of the variable regions.

Given the context of the immune response in the Peyer patches and the observed variability in the variable heavy chains, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the activation and proliferation of B cells.
