Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism... That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? And that usually happens when there's a chiral center or some kind of stereoisomerism like in geometric isomerism or something else.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining numbers 1-4. Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2,2’ and 6,6’ positions. So the structure has two benzene rings connected with a single bond. The groups on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, but wait, 6 is the para position relative to the connecting bond. So both rings have two substituents each, but I'm thinking about whether this creates a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element. Oh wait, biphenyl groups can have E and Z configurations based on how the rings are arranged. But for optical isomerism, do they need to have a plane of symmetry? Alternatively, maybe the substituents on each ring could lead to a chiral center. Wait no, the substituents here are on the phenyl rings, but the central bond is single. So each ring is attached to the central bond... Wait, dimethyl ester groups on each ring. Let me draw it mentally. Each ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. So each ring is substituted at 2 and 6. The central bond is between the 1 positions. So the two rings are connected in a way that allows rotation? But if there are substituents on each ring that are in a symmetrical arrangement, perhaps they could have isomerism. Wait, but each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6. 2 is ortho to the connecting bond, and 6 is para. So each ring's substituents are in positions that are para to each other? Wait, no, 2 and 6 are meta positions on the benzene ring, right? Because the numbering is 1 (connected), 2 is ortho, 3 is meta, 4 is para, etc. Wait, benzene rings are numbered so that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So in biphenyl, the main substituents are the two benzene rings attached. But let me think about whether this structure can have stereoisomerism. Biphenyl derivatives can exhibit geometric isomerism if the substituents are across from each other in a way that allows E/Z isomerism. Alternatively, if there's a chiral center, but I don't see any here. Each ring is symmetric? Each ring has two substituents (nitro and ester), but if the arrangement leads to a chiral center, then it would have optical isomerism. Wait, but the central bond is single, so the biphenyl can rotate. Unless the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule symmetric, then no isomerism. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then maybe. Let's see: each ring has a nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. But the two rings are connected at 1,1' positions. So the substituents are on each ring's ortho and para positions relative to the connecting point. Are these substituents on the same side or opposite? Hmm, but since the central bond is single, the rings can rotate freely unless hindered. So if the structure is such that the substituents on each ring are in a fixed position, then maybe it's possible to have isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry making it achiral. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. Structure is CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as glycolic acid? Wait, no, glycolic acid is HOCH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, which is CH2. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, when esterified, it would be OMe group attached. So the ester would have the structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (CH2) has OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, wait. The structure is O
           |
CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, the central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let's number the propanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate: the OH is on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (second CH2) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups (from the adjacent carbons). Wait, no, the actual structure is O

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon has four different groups: -OH, -CH2COOCH3, -CH3 (from the adjacent CH2?), no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-.

The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2, which is CH(OH)-.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the chain is:

O
|
COOCH3 is the third carbon.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)–CH2–COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2–COOCH3,

- and two CH2 groups (the first and third carbons in the chain). No, wait, the first carbon is CH2(OH), second is CH2, third is COOCH3.

Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2. So the groups attached to the second carbon are:

- one CH2OH (from the first carbon),

- one CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

- and two hydrogens? Or wait, no, each carbon in CH2 has two H's. So the second carbon is CH2, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait a moment. Let's think in terms of the structure. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2OH,

Carbon 2: CH2,

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So looking at Carbon 2, which is CH2. The groups attached to it are:

- one CH2OH (from Carbon 1),

- one CH2COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- two hydrogens.

Wait, that's only three groups. Oh wait, wait, no. Each carbon in a chain like that has four bonds. So Carbon 2 must have four bonds. So:

Carbon 1: CH2OH,

Carbon 2: CH2– connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

So Carbon 2 has two CH2 groups (from Carbon 1 and Carbon 3) and two hydrogens. So the groups are: two CH2 (no, wait, no, each is a CH2– group?), no, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents.

Wait, Carbon 2 is the middle carbon. So attached are:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH,

- Carbon 3: CH2COOCH3,

- and two hydrogens.

So Carbon 2 has two H's, one CH2OH group, and one CH2COOCH3 group. So the groups are: two CH2– groups (from adjacent carbons) and two H's. Wait, that's not possible because each bond is to another group. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
|
COOCH3 is on Carbon 3,

Carbon 2 has -OH, and two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to imagine the structure as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So Carbon 2 is CH2, which is connected to Carbon 1 (CH2OH) and Carbon 3 (CH2COOCH3). So Carbon 2 has two H's, one CH2OH, and one CH2COOCH3. That's three groups, but a carbon must have four bonds. Oh wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

HOCH2–CH2–COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the second carbon, which is CH2. Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2OH,

- Carbon 3: CH2COOCH3,

- and two H's.

Wait, but then that would make the second carbon have four substituents: two H's, one CH2OH, and one CH2COOCH3. So for a chiral center, each substituent must be different. Are the two H's considered the same? If so, then the substituents would be: two H's (same), CH2OH, and CH2COOCH3. So three different groups plus the same H. So that's not four different groups, so no chiral center. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So this molecule wouldn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ester is structured differently. Wait, another possibility: the structure is CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, no, that's ethyl acetoacetate or something else. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. Propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the third. So the second carbon is CH(OH). So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but then the second carbon is CH2, not CH. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers. If the molecule has a carbon with four different groups, then it's chiral.

In this molecule, looking at each carbon:

Carbon 1 (CH2OH): attached to two H's, one OH, one CH2.

Carbon 2 (CH2): attached to two H's, one CH2OH, one CH2COOCH3.

Carbon 3 (COOCH3): attached to O, etc.

So Carbon 2 has two H's, a CH2OH, and a CH2COOCH3. Are those substituents all different? Two H's are same, so no, so Carbon 2 isn't a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here. Therefore, option 2 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: maybe the ester is attached to another position. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the hydroxyl is on a chiral center. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)–CH2–COOCH3.

So the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- two CH2 groups,

- two H's.

But no, it's connected to one CH2OH (on the left) and one CH2COOCH3 (on the right), and two H's. So substituents are: H, H, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3. So two H's are the same, so not four different groups. So no chiral center. So no optical isomerism. So compound 2 doesn't show it.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. Benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen (so it's a carbonyl group) and connected to two phenyl groups and one R group. Wait, the structure is Ar–C(=O)–Ar. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups (same), one oxygen (double bond), and another R group (which is another Ar in this case). So for benzophenone, the structure is (Ph)2CO. So the central carbon is connected to two identical groups (Ph), one O, and another Ph. Wait, no, (Ph)2CO would have the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So the groups around the carbonyl are two Ph, and O. So the molecule is symmetric. So no chiral centers, no possibility for optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show it.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is CH2CH2(COOH)2, but in the trans configuration. So when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the structure has two ester groups on either end of a double bond. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is (E)-butenedioic acid diester. The structure is CH2CH(COOCH3)2, but actually, no. Wait, fumarate is the di-ester where the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides, making it a diastereomer of maleate, which is the cis isomer. Now, can a molecule with a double bond have geometric isomerism? Yes, E and Z. But geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but it's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about chiral centers. So, but wait, can the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's think about dimethyl fumarate. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does this create a chiral center? Hmm, the central carbon is the one in the double bond, which is sp² hybridized and not a chiral center. So the molecule itself is not chiral, but it can have E and Z isomerism. But since the question is about optical isomerism, which arises from chirality, then this would not have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Let's imagine the structure: the double bond is in the middle, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetric. Wait, is it? Because the two substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3 groups). So for dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, is the molecule symmetric? Let me draw it mentally.

Imagine the double bond is horizontal. On each end of the double bond, there are two COOCH3 groups. For the trans configuration, each ester is on opposite sides. So the structure would be like:

COOCH3  
    \  
C=C  
    /  
COOCH3  

But wait, the double bond's substituents are both COOCH3 on each end, but in trans configuration. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So it doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but what about if the substituents are different? Then it would be chiral. But in this case, both substituents on each side are the same. So the molecule is symmetric and not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the molecule is symmetrical, it's achiral. So if it's the trans isomer, it's symmetrical. The cis isomer (maleate) would have both substituents on the same side, making it also symmetrical? Wait, no. Let me think again. For maleic acid, the cis isomer would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side. When esterified, the two ester groups are on the same side. So the structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid diester. So in that case, the structure would be:

COOCH3  
   /  
C=C  
   \  
COOCH3  

Wait, no, if both are on the same side, then it's (Z) configuration. But in that case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, so both the cis and trans isomers of dimethyl fumarate would be achiral? Then neither would have optical isomerism. Hmm. So maybe I was wrong, and neither isomer has optical isomerism. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I need to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. Since the double bond in fumarate is between two carbons, each attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups, so they can't be chiral centers. Thus, the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting confused between geometric isomerism (which is a type of stereoisomerism) and optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. So if the compound doesn't have any chiral centers and is symmetrical, it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

So let me recap each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

I'm not entirely sure about this. Biphenyl compounds can exhibit stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center or a lack of a plane of symmetry. Let's think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. The substituents are on each ring: nitro at 6 and ester at 2. Each ring has two substituents. But the biphenyl itself can have different configurations, like whether the rings are in a coplanar arrangement or not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the two rings are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. Now, the question is, does the arrangement of substituents on each ring create a chiral center or make the molecule chiral without any centers?

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl linkage allows for the substituents to be in different positions, leading to a chiral molecule. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: when a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. So if the substituents on each ring are symmetrical across the plane, then it's achiral. But if not, it's chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and an ester group. Are their positions symmetrical? Let's imagine the biphenyl with the two rings connected in such a way that the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule would be symmetrical and thus not exhibit optical isomerism. But if they're not, then the molecule might be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps this molecule is symmetrical. Let me think: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. 2 and 6 are meta on the ring. So each ring has two substituents in meta positions. If the substituent arrangement on each ring is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that lacks symmetry, then it would have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides of the biphenyl, leading to different configurations. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should look for other clues.

Another approach: which of these compounds are known to have optical isomerism. For example, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but as I thought earlier, it doesn't have a chiral center. So no optical isomerism. So the correct compounds are those with chiral centers.

Wait, so let's think again.

1. If the molecule has two rings with substituents at 2 and 6, which are symmetrical? Or not.

Wait, each substituent is at 2 and 6 on each ring. So if the molecule has substituents arranged in a way that they're mirror images, then it's achiral. But if they are not mirror images, then the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged opposite each other, making the molecule symmetrical. If that's the case, no optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely sure about this one. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral because the substituents on each ring create a lack of symmetry.

Another thought: in biphenyl systems, the substituents can be arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. For example, if each ring has two different substituents in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond.

Wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro and an ester group. So the substituents on each ring are different (nitro and ester), and their positions are 2 and 6.

So each ring has a nitro and an ester group, but their positions are 2 and 6, which are meta positions. So each ring has substituents in positions that are meta. So for each ring, the nitro is at 6, and ester at 2.

But considering the biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected at their 1 positions. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6. So for the left ring, substituents are at 2 and 6; same for the right ring.

Now, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole has no plane of symmetry, it might be chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the central bond, it could create asymmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are such that the overall structure is symmetrical. For example, if the nitro on the left ring is in a position that mirrors the nitro on the right ring, making the molecule symmetrical.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe this compound does exhibit optical isomerism, which would make option A correct if 1 and 4 are correct, but I thought 4 doesn't.

Wait, let's move to other compounds and come back.

So, reevaluating:

Compound 1: ?

Compound 2: No optical isomerism.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So the only possibility is if any of the compounds have a chiral center.

Wait, I think I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- CH2OH (left),

- CH2COOCH3 (right),

- two H's.

So substituents: two H's, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3.

So two H's are same, so not four different groups. So no chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

So only compound 1 could have optical isomerism. Wait, but the question says which of the four. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: what about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry? For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical, then it's not chiral.

But in compound 1, each ring has a nitro and an ester. Are the substituents arranged symmetrically? Let's say that the nitro is on one side of the biphenyl, and the ester on the other. If the arrangement is such that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring, making the molecule symmetrical.

But without a clear image, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to see which of the given options include only chiral compounds.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4. But I thought 2 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

Option B: 3 and 4. I don't think so.

Option C: 2 and 3. No.

Option D: 1 and 2. No, 2 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let's think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid. The structure is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does this create a chiral center? No, because the double bond is sp² hybridized. The substituents on each carbon of the double bond are:

Left carbon: CH2, connected to the double bond and two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents. For fumarate, the structure is:

CH2= C (COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2- C (COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

Left carbon: CH2 on one side and COOCH3 on the other.

Right carbon: COOCH3 on one side (from the double bond) and another COOCH3 on the other.

Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking clearly. Alternatively, maybe this molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. So it's achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, based on all this, which compounds have optical isomerism?

Only compound 1 seems possible. But looking at the options, option A includes 1, 2, 4. Since I don't think 2 and 4 have it, maybe I'm wrong about 1.

Wait, maybe compound 1 has a chiral center. Let's think: perhaps the biphenyl rings have substituents that create a chiral center. Wait, but the central bond is single, so the biphenyl can rotate, which would allow any stereoisomerism to be lost. Unless the substituents are in a fixed position. Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that rotation is hindered, creating a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring's substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule's mirror image isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the molecule's arrangement is such that the nitro groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule chiral. For instance, each ring's nitro and ester could be arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry.

But without a clear structure, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that's unlikely because the options don't have that as a choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find which compounds have chiral centers.

Looking again, perhaps I was wrong about compound 2.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second CH2, which has:

- CH2OH on one side,

- CH2COOCH3 on the other,

- two H's.

So groups are: two H's, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3. So two H's are same, so no four different groups. No chiral center.

So back to option 1. Another approach: perhaps the biphenyl substituents are such that the molecule is chiral. For example, if each ring's substituents are arranged in a way that there's no symmetry.

So, in the case of each ring having a nitro and an ester at 2 and 6 positions, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So, it would have optical isomerism.

If that's true, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But 2 doesn't, and 4 doesn't. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Option 4 is dimethyl fumarate, which as we discussed, doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH2= C(COOCH3)2, trans configuration. The molecule is symmetrical because the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making it mirror symmetrical along the plane through the double bond. So the molecule is achiral, no optical isomerism.

So, no. So, the only compound left is compound 1, which may have optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, none of the options have only 1. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another thought: perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid. The structure is (E)-butenedioate. But the molecule itself isn't chiral because it's symmetrical. However, when you have a substituent on each end that's different, but in this case, both are the same (COOCH3), so symmetry exists.

Wait, but what about if the ester groups were different? Then the molecule would be chiral. But in this case, they're the same, so no.

Hmm. So, if none of the compounds except 1 have optical isomerism, but the options don't have an option where only 1 is correct.

Wait, is there any other possibility? Did I miss any other compound?

Looking back at compound 1, perhaps if each ring's substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks symmetry, making it chiral.

Another approach: let's think of the biphenyl structure. If the two rings are connected at 1 and 1' positions, and each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta positions.

In the case of 1,1’-biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule can be reflected over a plane, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is not symmetric, making it chiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Another approach: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not symmetrical, then the molecule may be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center somewhere else. For example, if one of the substituents is a chiral center, but that's not the case here. The substituents are nitro and ester groups, which are not chiral.

So, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, then what's the correct answer?

If none of the compounds have optical isomerism, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I was wrong about compound 2.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's not correct. Let me think again. The correct structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- one CH2OH,

- one CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So substituents are: two H's, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3. So two H's are same, so no four different groups. So no chiral center.

So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about geometric isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is a subset of stereoisomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that only compound 1 has optical isomerism, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But, perhaps in this arrangement, the molecule is chiral. Wait, but for that, the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, the structure of E-dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3  
    \  
C=C  
    /  
COOCH3  

Wait, that's the structure. So, each ester is on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetrical because the substituents are same on both sides. So no, it doesn't have a chiral center and is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps none of the compounds have optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think about whether the substituents on the biphenyl create a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is chiral. For example, if each ring's substituents are in a position that makes the molecule non-symmetrical.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis or plane, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: in biphenyl derivatives, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule not symmetrical, then it will exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents are not mirror images across the central bond, the molecule is chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, the substituents on each ring are in meta positions. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions relative to the central bond are not mirror images, the molecule would be chiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say definitively. Based on the given options, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each compound's possibility:

1. Could have optical isomerism if the molecule is chiral. I'm uncertain.

2. No.

3. No.

4. No.

So, the only possible is compound 1. But the options don't have an option where only 1 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, each ring has a nitro and an ester group, but their positions relative to the central bond are such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Thus, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

But looking at the options again, the only option that includes 1 is option A and D.

But earlier, I thought 2 doesn't have it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 2. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: could the structure be different? Suppose it's CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3. No, that's not correct because that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)–CH2–COOCH3.

The second carbon is CH2, which has two H's, a CH2OH, and a CH2COOCH3. So substituents are not four different groups, so no chiral center.

Thus, compound 2 doesn't have it.

So, the only possible compound is 1.

Looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. So perhaps 1 is correct, but 2 and 4 are not. So option A is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center.

A chiral center requires four different substituents.

Compound 1: Looking for any carbon with four different groups.

In the biphenyl structure, are any carbons attached to four different groups? The ester groups are on the benzene rings. The benzene rings are connected, but the carbons on the rings are all attached to two phenyl groups, so unlikely to be chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon of the biphenyl is chiral? No, because it's connected to two benzene rings, which are the same, so no.

So, no chiral centers in compound 1.

Thus, compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, this is frustrating. If none of the compounds have optical isomerism, but the options don't include that, I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, actually, the structure is CH2= C(COOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- For the left carbon: CH2 and two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

Left carbon: CH2 and one COOCH3.

Right carbon: two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure:

The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3.

Carbon 2: CH2- (from carbon 1) and double bond to carbon 3.

Carbon 3: double bond to carbon 2 and two COOCH3 groups.

So, carbon 3 is connected to:

- two COOCH3 groups,

- a double bond to carbon 2,

- and a single bond to carbon 4 (if any).

Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH2(COOCH3)2. No, wait, I'm not getting it right. Let me imagine the correct structure.

Actually, dimethyl fumarate's structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, carbon 2 is double-bonded to carbon 3. Carbon 2 has a CH2 group and is attached to a COOCH3. Carbon 3 is attached to two COOCH3 groups.

So, carbon 3 is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond to carbon 2. So, the groups around carbon 3 are: two COOCH3, a double bond (to CH2), and a single bond (to CH2). So, substituents are: two COOCH3, a CH2 group, and another CH2 group? No, that can't be right because that would make four substituents. Wait, no, each carbon in a double bond has only three substituents because of the double bond. So carbon 3 has:

- one double bond to carbon 2,

- two single bonds to COOCH3 groups.

So, the substituents are: two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. That's only three substituents. So, no chiral center here.

Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and isn't optically active.

So, now I'm stuck. All four compounds don't have optical isomerism, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 2.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 2. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's CH3COOCH2CH2OH. That would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, right? Because the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, that's different from what I thought before. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the second carbon, which is CH(OH). Now, what are the substituents on this carbon?

- One CH3,

- one OH,

- one COOCH3,

- one CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the next carbon (which is a carbonyl group, but wait, no, it's connected to COOCH3 via a single bond.

Wait, the structure after CH(OH) is COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the carbon next to it, which is the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the third carbon, which is a carbonyl group (but that's a double bond, so perhaps it's not part of the substituents).

Wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), with substituents:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the single bond to the next carbon (which is carbonyl, but that's a double bond, so the substituent is the carbonyl group? No, because it's a double bond, the substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of the structure as:

The second carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a single bond to the third carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen (carbonyl group).

So, the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a carbonyl group (which is a substituent here? Or is it part of the chain).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group. Wait, no, because the third carbon is a carbonyl.

Hmm, I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to determine if the second carbon has four different groups.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the third carbon, which is part of the carbonyl group.

Wait, the third carbon is connected via a single bond to the second carbon, but is double-bonded to oxygen. So, the substituents on the second carbon are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the carbonyl group (which is a C=O).

So, all four substituents are different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and C=O. Therefore, the second carbon is a chiral center. Thus, compound 2 does have optical isomerism.

Ah! So I was wrong earlier. So compound 2 does have a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Now, that changes things.

So, which compounds have optical isomerism:

1. ?

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

Now, looking back at compound 1.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule has a chiral center or is chiral due to lack of symmetry.

But in compound 1, the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are connected to each other. Are any of the carbons on the rings attached to four different groups?

Wait, the carbons on the benzene rings are sp² hybridized and connected to the phenyl groups. So, they can't be chiral centers because they are part of an aromatic ring and have only three substituents (two from the ring and one from the substituent, e.g., nitro or ester). So, no chiral centers in the rings.

Thus, compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center and is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, now the only compound that has optical isomerism is compound 2.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2,4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B)3 and4 → No.

C)2 and3 → 2 is correct, but 3 isn't.

D)1 and2 → 2 is correct, but 1 isn't.

So, none of the options correctly include only 2. Thus, perhaps I made a mistake again.

Wait, let me double-check compound 2.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the carbonyl group (which is a double bond, so perhaps it's not a substituent in the same way).

Wait, perhaps I was incorrect in considering the substituents. The substituents on the chiral carbon are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the group on the other side of the carbonyl. Wait, no, the substituent is the rest of the molecule beyond the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl oxygen, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The second carbon is CH(OH), which is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the next carbon (which is a carbonyl group, but that's a double bond, so it's not a substituent in the same way. Or perhaps it's considered as a substituent).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group connected to the carbonyl.

No, that doesn't fit.

I think I'm getting stuck again. Another approach: perhaps compound 2 does have a chiral center, making it optically active. Therefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is options A and D and C. But none have only 2.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4.

So, if 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not, then option A is incorrect.

But perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Structure of dimethyl fumarate: (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, trans configuration.

So, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2.

Carbon 1: CH2,

Carbon 2: C connected to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, carbons in double bonds are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers because they have a double bond. So no optical isomerism in compound 4.

So, back to compound 2: if it has a chiral center, then the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me confirm the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH.

2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH.

When esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)–CH2–COOCH3.

The second carbon is CH2, connected to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So substituents are: two H's, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3. Two H's are same, so no chiral center.

Thus, compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center, and no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to square one. None of the compounds have optical isomerism, but that's not an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think differently.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents on each ring are nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, each ring has a nitro and an ester group.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But considering the positions, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, if the two rings each have a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, and the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry between the two rings, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, perhaps none of the compounds have optical isomerism. But since that's not an option, I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other forms of chirality, such as axial chirality, which can occur in allenes or certain biphenyl structures.

In biphenyl compounds, axial chirality can occur if the rings are connected in a way that the substituents on each ring are arranged around the central bond without a plane of symmetry.

So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can exhibit axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions relative to the central bond are not mirror images, then the molecule would exhibit axial chirality and thus optical isomerism.

Thus, compound 1 would show optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: yes.

Compound 2: no.

Compound 3: no.

Compound 4: no.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes 1 is option A (1,2,4) and D (1,2). But since 2 and 4 don't have it, the correct option must be A, but that includes 2 and 4 which I think don't have it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. If the substituents were different, the molecule could be chiral. But since they're the same, the molecule isn't chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that has optical isomerism is 1. But the options don't have an option with only 1. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the answer is option A) 1,2,4.

Because I think compound 2 does have a chiral center, but earlier I thought it didn't. Let me reevaluate.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the carbonyl group.

Wait, the carbonyl group is a substituent? Or is it part of the chain?

Wait, the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the rest of the molecule beyond the carbonyl.

But I'm not considering that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is compound 2. Then, the second carbon is CH2, connected to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So substituents: H, H, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3. Two H's same, so no chiral center.

Thus, compound 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound with optical isomerism is 1.

But the options don't include this, so perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not given.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Structure of dimethyl fumarate: CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2.

Carbon 2 is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond to carbon 1.

So, substituents on carbon 2 are:

- two COOCH3,

- a double bond to CH2.

So, carbon 2 has three substituents: two COOCH3 and a double bond. Can't be a chiral center.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, in conclusion, only compound 1 has optical isomerism, but none of the options correctly reflect this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to choose the option that includes 1.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits axial chirality in certain cases.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are a nitro group (-NO₂) and a methyl ester (-COOCH₃). The biphenyl structure can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically relative to the central bond, lacking a plane of symmetry. This would make the molecule chiral and capable of showing optical isomerism.  

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), a carbonyl ester group (-COOCH₃), and a hydrogen atom. This carbon is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.  

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups, making it symmetrical. There are no chiral centers or axial chirality, so this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.  

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of maleic acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂ in the (E)-configuration. The double-bonded carbon atoms are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical due to the identical ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, making it achiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism as they lack chirality.

### Correct Option:
The compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.

ANSWER: D
