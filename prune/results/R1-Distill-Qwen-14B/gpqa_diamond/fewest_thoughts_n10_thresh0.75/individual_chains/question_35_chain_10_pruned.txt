Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator, which is given as a 2x2 matrix. Hmm, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

The operator Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh wait, so S is written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I remember that matrices like this often show up in spin operators, like the Pauli matrices. Right, Pauli matrices are fundamental in spin-1/2 systems, so this must be related to spin angular momentum.

The problem is asking which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay = c*S, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. So maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of S.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find its eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation: det(S - λI) = 0.

So, the matrix S - λI would be [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]]. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i). That's λ² - (i^2). Wait, i squared is -1, so it becomes λ² - (-1) = λ² +1. So the equation is λ² +1 =0. The solutions are λ = i and λ = -i.

So the eigenvalues of S are i and -i. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c*S, would be c*(i) and c*(-i). Let me calculate that. Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in: c*i = (h/(4π)) * i, and similarly for the negative. So the eigenvalues are ±i * h/(4π).

Wait, but the options given don't seem to directly match this. Let me look again.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and the real part is ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't fit because the eigenvalues I found are purely imaginary. Their real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ±h/(4π). So option A is saying the real parts are non-zero, which isn't the case. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: The imaginary part is ±1/2, real ±1. But wait, our eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so the real part is zero. So B can't be
