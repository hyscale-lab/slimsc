Okay, let's see. I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Oh wait, and we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like N2/N1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Oh wait, wait. Let me get that right. The ratio of the populations is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T). So if E2 is higher than E1, the ratio will be less than one.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but how does that tie into the temperatures of the stars?

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, for star_1, the population of the excited state (let's say state 2) is twice that of star_2 at the same state. Or wait, maybe I should think about each star's own comparison. No, wait, each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2. The ratio of the excited states in each star will depend on their respective temperatures.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased is that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio N2/N1 for star_1 is higher than that for star_2. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe it's the excitation level, which relates to the ratio of the number of atoms in that energy level relative to the ground state.

Wait, I think I need to model each star's situation. So for each star, say star 1 and star 2, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (N2) to the ground state (N1) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, N2_1/N1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, N2_2/N1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps N2_1 = 2 * N2_2? Or maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio? Hmm, no, perhaps it's more about the relative excitation. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for each star, the number of excited atoms in that level is compared. So for star_1, N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. Or wait, perhaps it's that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so N2_1 / N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2). Hmm, that could be possible.

Wait, perhaps the excitation level is given by the ratio N2/N1 for each star. So star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2's. So N2_1/N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2/N1_2). Hmm. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the excitation is measured as the number of excited atoms per atom. If star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2, then N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. But since each star has its own total number of atoms, maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since both are in LTE, the ratio of the populations in each star's case is determined by their respective temperatures. So if star_1's ratio is higher than star_2's, that would imply that T1 is lower than T2. Because a lower temperature would mean that the exponential is larger. Because when T is lower, the exponent -ΔE/(k T) becomes more negative, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if T is lower, the exponent is a larger negative number, making the ratio smaller. So if star_1 has a higher ratio N2/N1 than star_2, that would mean that star_1 has a lower temperature than star_2. Because N2/N1 is higher when the exponent is less negative, which happens when T is higher. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let me think: N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So higher T leads to higher N2/N1. So if star_1 has a higher ratio, it must have a higher T than star_2. Wait, but the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So N2_1/N1_1 is twice N2_2/N1_2. Oh, wait, no, perhaps not. Because the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 (N2_1) is twice that in star_2 (N2_2). But that doesn't account for the total number of atoms in each star, which might be different. So perhaps the ratio N2/N1 is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

Wait, I think the way to model this is to write the ratio for each star and then take the ratio between them. Let's denote the energy difference ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote k as Boltzmann's constant, approx 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same number as ΔE here. Interesting.

So for star_1: N2_1/N1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: N2_2/N1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So perhaps N2_1/N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2/N1_2). 

Wait, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps star_1's N2_1 is twice star_2's N2_2. But I'm not sure. The wording is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the excitation relative to the ground state. So the ratio of the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (N2_1/N1_1) = 2 * (N2_2/N1_2). Let's assume that's the case.

So let me write that:

N2_1/N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2/N1_2)

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)) for the respective star.

So substituting, we have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

We can take the natural log of both sides to solve for T1 and T2.

Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Let me rearrange the equation. Let's bring all terms to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

So,

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but in our case, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Wait, that's interesting. So substituting:

(1 K) * [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

Which simplifies to:

[ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2) / 1 K → ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) * K. Wait, no, because 1 K multiplied by [ ... ] equals ln(2). So:

1 * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

We can rearrange this as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, no. Let me check:

Option D: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Yes, that's exactly what we have here. So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Let me go back.

We started with N2_1/N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2/N1_2 )

Which became exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Bring terms together:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2 ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

But since ΔE = k * 1 K, as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K → yes, so ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So:

[ (1/T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2) / (1 K) ? No, wait. Wait, the equation after substitution is:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 -1/T1) = ln(2)

But ΔE/(k) = 1 K, so:

1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but this would imply that (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) / (1 K) → but that can't be because units don't match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit handling.

Wait, let's re-express the equation. Let me redo the substitution.

We have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Bring ΔE/(k T2) to left:

[ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

But ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K → ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So:

1 K * ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but then it's:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

Wait, but this leads to the left side being in units of 1/K, and the right side is ln(2) over K. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals ln(2)/(1 K). But this doesn't make sense because the left side is 1/K, the right is 1/(K) as well. So the equation is correct.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which matches.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels to the temperature. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star 1 and star 2, the ratios of the populations in the excited and ground states are:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, meaning:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Rewriting in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
