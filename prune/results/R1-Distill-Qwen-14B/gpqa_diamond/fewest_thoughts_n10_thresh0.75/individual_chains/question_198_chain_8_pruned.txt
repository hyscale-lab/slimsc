Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in solution. Let me read it again.

So, the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on stability constants. From what I remember, the stability constant (β) for a complex indicates how stable it is. So, a higher β means the complex is more stable. The complexes are formed step-wise, right? Like, CoSCN+ is the first complex, then Co(SCN)_2^2+, and so on.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the tetrahedral one, which is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2+ complex. Or wait, maybe not. I'm not entirely sure about the colors corresponding to each complex, but perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ as blue? Or wait, no, I think the tetrahedral complexes might have different colors. Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the math here and less on the color specifics.

So, the problem is about the distribution of cobalt species in solution. The total cobalt concentration includes all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ions. The species present would be Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2+}. Wait, but the stability constants given are β1 to β4. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, I think the stability constants are for each step of complexation. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), β2 is for [Co(SC
