Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember from my studies that stability constants (beta) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex, right?

The question gives me a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{n+}? Which one is that in the list? Let me check the beta values. Oh, the β4 is 16. But wait, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- perhaps, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}. Or maybe I have the numbering wrong. Wait, I think β1 is the first complex, which would be the monomeric one. So β1 = 9 is for [Co(SCN)]^+.

So the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the one with two SCN- ions, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has β2=40. Oh wait, but wait. I'm not entirely sure about the colors. I remember that different Co complexes have different colors. Co(NH3)6^3+ is pink, but with thiocyanate, the colors are different. The blue one is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, right? Or wait, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the calculation regardless of the color.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I'll assume is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has β2=40. Or wait, maybe β
