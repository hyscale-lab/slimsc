Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved in calculating the concentration of different complexes in a solution. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, that's probably the Co(SCN)_2 complex, maybe. So the question is about finding the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 in the solution.

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the stability constants. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution. Since there are four complexes, we'll have to consider all of them, but the question is specifically about the dithiocyanato one, which I think is the β2 value since β2=40.

Wait, no, wait. The β values are the stability constants for each successive formation. So the first complex would be Co(SCN), second Co(SCN)_2, third Co(SCN)_3, and fourth Co(SCN)_4. The stability constant βn is for the reaction Co(SCN)_{n-1} + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n.

So each β is the ratio [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co(SCN)_{n-1}} [SCN^-]).

But to find the fractions, we need to calculate the conditional formation constants and then determine the fraction for each complex.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the fraction of each complex. The fraction f_n of the complex with n thiocyanate ions is given by f_n = (β1β2...βn) / ( [1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + ... ] )

Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate each f_n step by step.

Wait
