Okay, so I've got this physics question here about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what regularization is. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results non-physical. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting a finite result after renormalization.

Now, the question is asking which theory doesn't need regularization. So I need to think about each option and whether they require this technique.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstrings are an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with gravity, right? They're a type of string theory. I think string theories in general don't have the same kinds of divergences as point particle theories because strings are extended objects. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Do they still have issues that require regularization? I remember that string theories might have their own set of problems, but maybe they don't require the same kind of divergent integrals that other QFTs do. Or perhaps they use different methods, like the string tension, which could act similarly to a cutoff. But I'm not certain if they ever need regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbation theory works. But I also remember that QCD does have issues with things like confinement and the mass of particles. Do they need regularization? I think yes, because when you calculate loop diagrams in QCD, you get divergences. So you must regularize those, maybe using methods like lattice QCD or other cutoff techniques. So QCD would require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established theory and the first successful quantum field theory. But I know that in QED, when you calculate processes like electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. These require regularization, like maybe using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. After regularization, you perform renormalization to absorb the divergences. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. So classical ED
