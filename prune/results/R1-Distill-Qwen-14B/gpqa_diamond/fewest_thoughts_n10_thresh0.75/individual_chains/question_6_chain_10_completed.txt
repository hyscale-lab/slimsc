Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. 

Okay, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, so this looks like a two-dimensional potential in polar coordinates. I remember that in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle would involve the kinetic energy terms in r and θ, plus the potential energy.

Wait, the potential has two terms: one is (1/2)kr², which reminds me of a harmonic oscillator. The other term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos squared theta... that makes me think of angular components. Like, maybe it's a perturbation or another harmonic oscillator in the angular direction.

Wait, but how do these terms combine? Maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms that separate the variables r and θ. Let me see. The first term is (1/2)kr², and the second is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Alternatively, maybe factor it differently.

Alternatively, since cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that, the second term becomes (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos(2θ))/2 = (3/4)kr² (1 + cos(2θ)). So the total potential becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² (1 + cos(2θ)).

Wait, let's compute that. (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ). Combining the terms without cosine: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps much.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the potential as a sum of two separate potentials: one purely radial and another angular-dependent. Wait, but if it's (1/2)kr² plus this angular part, maybe it's better to see if the potential can be expressed as a product of functions in r and θ. But probably not, because the angular part is cos²θ, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to go into Cartesian coordinates. Let me see. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, and cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k (x²).

Wait, because (x²) = r² cos²θ. Oh, wait! So the potential V is (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x². Oh, that's a big simplification. So in Cartesian terms, the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x². But wait, r squared is x² + y². So substituting that in, V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2) k x².

Let me combine like terms. The x² terms: (1/2 k x²) + (3/2 k x²) = (4/2)k x² = 2k x². The y² term remains (1/2 k y²). So overall, V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! So the potential is a sum of two harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction with frequency sqrt(2k/m) and another in the y-direction with frequency sqrt(k/(2m)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise. The general form of a harmonic oscillator in x is (1/2) m ω_x² x², with energy levels (n + 1/2) ℏ ω_x. So in our case, the x-component of the potential is 2k x². Let me write that as (1/2) m ω_x² x². So, 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/(m). So ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, the y-component is (1/2)k y², which is (1/2) m ω_y² y². So (1/2)k = (1/2) m ω_y² → ω_y² = k/(m) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the potential separates into two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y. So the total energy should be the sum of the energies from each direction.

So the energy for the x-direction would be (2n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, where n_x is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). Similarly, the y-direction energy is (2n_y +1/2) ℏ ω_y? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the standard harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ℏ ω. So for each direction, the energy is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x and (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

But here, the x potential is 2k x², which is equivalent to (1/2) m (2 sqrt(k/m))² x². So ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), as I found earlier. Similarly, ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So, each energy would be (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) for x, and (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m) for y.

Wait no, wait. Wait, in the standard form: V(x) = (1/2) m ω² x². So, when V(x) = 2k x², then (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). So the energy for x is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for y, V(y) is (1/2)k y² → (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So energy is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E would be the sum of these two:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let's factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Simplify the terms:

2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x + 1

So,

E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m) → (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me compute that:

2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1.

Plus (n_y + 1/2) : 2n_x +1 +n_y +1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

So the energy is (2n_x +n_y +3/2) multiplied by ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking back at the options:

Option C says E=(2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that's the one. 

Let me double-check the options. Option C is (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) multiplied by ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches what I derived.

Wait, but I should ensure that I didn't mix up the directions. Because in the potential, the x-component has a higher coefficient. Oh, because the x-component's oscillator is stronger, so higher frequency, leading to higher energy per quantum. So the energy terms should be correct as I derived.

So the correct option is C.


The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To simplify, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), the potential becomes \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), which separates into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are given by \( E = (n + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer. For the \( x \)-direction, the energy is \( E_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and for the \( y \)-direction, the energy is \( E_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The total energy is the sum of these contributions:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1 + n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).**

Answer: C
