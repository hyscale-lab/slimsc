Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to try to take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, column matrix, so that's a vector, right? Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and they have to be normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so it's not normalized. That might be important later.

Then there are two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as matrices. Let me write down the matrices for P and Q.

Matrix P:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Matrix Q:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So, Q is a diagonal matrix. That makes things easier because the eigenvalues are on the diagonal. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1 and -1, and 0 maybe? Wait, the second diagonal element is 0. So when you measure Q, you can get 1, 0, or -1.

The question is: if we measure Q just after measuring P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no. Wait, the wording is: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So first, P is measured, getting 0, and then Q is measured, getting -1.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements matters because measuring one affects the state for the next. So first measure P, then measure Q. So we need to find the probability that P gives 0, and then in the new state, Q gives -1.

Hmm, okay, so first I need
