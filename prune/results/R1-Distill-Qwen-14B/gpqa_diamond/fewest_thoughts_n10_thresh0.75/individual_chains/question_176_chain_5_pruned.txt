Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. Let me read the problem again and try to figure out what's going on.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I'm assuming this is a vector in a three-dimensional space since there are three elements. So, the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. It's probably normalized, but I should check that later.

There are two observables, P and Q, each represented by a square matrix. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, okay, that's a bit sparse. Let me write that out to visualize it better.

Operator P matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And operator Q is given by a diagonal matrix. The first row is (1, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -1). So Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is: If someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no. Wait, the order is important here. Oh, wait, no, the question says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So first P is measured, then Q is measured. The probability is for getting 0 in P's measurement and -1 in Q's measurement. Wait, but if you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, which then affects the subsequent measurement of Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and then, given that, getting -1 when measuring Q. So it's two sequential measurements: first P, then Q. So the joint probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that the state is in the eigenstate corresponding to P=0.

So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

Wait, but let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the possible outcomes when measuring P and the corresponding eigenvectors. Then, the initial state is projected onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, from that projected state, find the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Wait, but before that, I should check if the initial state is normalized. Let me calculate the norm of the state vector.

The state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The norm squared is (-1
