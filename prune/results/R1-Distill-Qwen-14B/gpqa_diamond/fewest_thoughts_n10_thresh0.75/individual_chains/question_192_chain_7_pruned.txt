Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. Wait, so the conductor has a cavity, right? And the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Oh, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor, but how about the cavity? Well, since l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and the cavity's radius is r, but l is greater than R which is larger than r, so P is outside the conductor and outside the cavity.

The angle between l and s is theta. So, s is the distance between the two centers, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. So, the geometry here must involve some vector components or maybe the law of cosines.

Wait, what's the setup again? The conductor is initially uncharged. So when we place a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in a conductor, the charges redistribute themselves. Since the conductor is uncharged, but the cavity has a charge, the conductor must have induced charges.

Wait, so the cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor was neutral. When a charge +q is inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must develop an induced charge. Because the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because any charge inside a conductor must reside on the surface, but wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface has -q by induction, and the outer surface has +q to keep the total charge zero. Wait, no, wait, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero: inner surface (-q) + outer (+q) = 0.

But wait
