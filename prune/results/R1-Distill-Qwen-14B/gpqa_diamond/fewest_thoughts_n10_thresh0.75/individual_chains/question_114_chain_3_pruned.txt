Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I'll focus on the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me write out the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, the product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So what reaction could convert a ketone into a nitrile with a hydroxyl group?

Wait, maybe it's an example of the Stephen reduction or some kind of substitution. Wait, no, I think I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but ketones aren't typically involved in SN reactions. Oh wait, but in the presence of a strong acid, maybe something happens.

Wait, another thought. The product has a nitrile group. So perhaps the ketone is being converted into a nitrile via some kind of substitution. But how? Let me recall: maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah! Cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide ion (CN-) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The reaction adds a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group to the carbonyl carbon. So the mechanism is: the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with HCN, but in this case, the reagent is NaCN. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but maybe in the presence of an acid, it becomes HCN.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The
