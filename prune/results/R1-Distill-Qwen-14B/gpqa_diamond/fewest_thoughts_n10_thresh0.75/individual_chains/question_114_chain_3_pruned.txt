Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Hmm, I remember that reagents are the substances used to cause a chemical reaction, so I need to determine what A and B are from the options given.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh, right! I think this is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, perhaps a substitution where the ketone is attacked. Wait, but ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition, not substitution. Oh wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a nucleophile like CN- attacks a ketone, it's usually via a planar sp2 hybridized carbonyl carbon. So the mechanism would involve the nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an addition product. 

Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write that structure. The nitrile group is on the second carbon, which has a hydroxyl group and two methyl groups attached. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh wait, no, wait. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents matter. So the formula would be, I think, (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Butan-2-one is four carbons: (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butane has four carbons. The nitrile is at the end, maybe? Or on the second carbon. So structure-wise, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but
