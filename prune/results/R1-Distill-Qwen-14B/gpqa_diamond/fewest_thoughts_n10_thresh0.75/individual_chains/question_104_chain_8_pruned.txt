Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity, right. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the planet's orbit.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a Neptune-mass planet. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the key here is to figure out the orbital periods of the two planets based on the Doppler shifts given.

The problem gives me the shifts: Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period?

I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. So a larger shift means the star is moving faster. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)), but wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the velocity and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_planet is much smaller than M_star. So M_planet can be approximated as negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, and since both stars are same, M_star is same for both.

So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Wait, but wait, because for a circular orbit, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. So for circular orbits, that term is 1.

Also, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so M_planet is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3
