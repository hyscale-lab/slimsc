Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the setup is that two stars, both the same mass as the Sun, have planets detected using the RV method. Both planets are similar to Neptune in mass, so their masses are about the same. The orbits are circular, so that might simplify things.

The key here is the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does that relate to their orbital periods?

I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p)^2) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )) ) Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version since M_p is much smaller than M_star. Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun and the planets are Neptune-sized, which is much smaller, I can probably ignore M_p compared to M_star.

So the formula for K, the velocity semi-amplitude, is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^1/3) )) * (1/P) )^(1/3) ). No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. I think the formula is K = ( (G * P * M_p ) / ( (2π c^2 ) * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * something.

Alternatively, I recall that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * ( (1) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) ), but since e is zero here as the orbits are circular, that simplifies. But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (M_p / M_star) / (M_star^(1/3) * (something) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity. The RV method gives us the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and other factors.

I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P * c) )

But perhaps there's a more straightforward relationship. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have the same mass, the ratio of their velocity semi-amplitudes K should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period ratio
