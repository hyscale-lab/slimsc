Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

So the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's roughly the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would have to propagate outward, and we wouldn't notice the effects for about that time.

But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the ratio of their fluxes, F1/F2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch is the part where two protons collide, one emits a positron and a neutrino, forming a deuteron. So this is the main source of solar neutrinos, right? Because each pp-III reaction emits a neutrino.

If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, then the production of those neutrinos would stop. But wait, the question says "hypothetically" stopped, so other reactions are ongoing. So other neutrino sources are still active.

Wait, what other sources are there? There's also the CNO cycle, which contributes a smaller fraction of the Sun's energy. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos too, but from different reactions. For example, electron neutrinos are produced in the CNO cycle as well, but maybe in a different energy range?

Alternatively, there's also the possibility of considering the neutrinos from the decay of heavier elements or other fusion stages, but I think the main source is the pp-III branch.

So before the pp-III stopped, neutrinos were being produced from both the pp-III and CNO cycle. But after stopping, only CNO neutrinos are produced.

Wait no, the question says that other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO cycle continues, but pp-III is stopped. So the neutrino flux would now come solely from the CNO cycle.

Wait, but the pp-III is the main source of neutrinos. So if it stops, the total flux would drop, but in which energy bands?

Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have a certain energy spectrum. I remember that the pp-III neutrinos are lower energy. For example, the Beryllium-7 neutrinos (like in the CNO cycle) are higher energy. Or wait, the pp-III neutrinos are about a few hundred keV, and the CNO neutrinos are higher, like several MeV? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are from the reaction where a proton captures a proton, emits a positron and a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 0.42 MeV (since the mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c², but the binding energy is small, so the emitted neutrino energy is about 0.42 MeV, which is 420 keV). So the neutrinos are in the range of around 400 keV, with a peak there.

On the other hand, neutrinos from the CNO cycle are from different reactions. For example, the reaction where carbon-13 captures a proton to become nitrogen-14, emitting a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 15.5 MeV, which is way higher. Wait, that can't be right. Because 15 MeV is way higher than the options given here (the bands are up to 900 keV, which is 0.9 MeV). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Or maybe the CNO neutrinos are lower energy?

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me think again. In the pp-III branch, the neutrinos are about 0.42 MeV (420 keV). So the energy is around there. The CNO cycle's neutrinos are from the decay of Beryllium-7. Let me recall: Be-7 is produced in the CNO cycle, and when it captures a proton, it becomes Boron-8, which then decays, emitting a neutrino. Wait, no, B-8 decays into Be-8, which then emits a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino energy from that decay is about 3.77 MeV. But wait, that's way above the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. So if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from CNO would be at higher energies than 900 keV.

Wait, but the problem says the neutrino flux is in these lower energy bands. So if the pp-III stopped, what's the impact?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the different energy groups within the same source. If pp-III is the main source, and it's stopped, then the flux in the lower bands would drop, while the higher bands (from other sources?) would be lower, but wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are at lower energies. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the sources. Let me think: the dominant neutrino source in the Sun is the pp-III, producing about 90% of the solar neutrinos, at around 420 keV. The CNO neutrinos make up about 8% and are at higher energies. Wait, but 420 keV is in the 700-800 keV band? No, it's below that. So band 1 is 700-800 keV. So the pp-III neutrinos are below 700 keV, right? So if the pp-III stops, the lower energy neutrinos (like below 700 keV) would drop, but the higher ones (like from CNO) would continue.

Wait, but in the scenario, the pp-III stopped, so all the neutrinos from that source are no longer produced. So the neutrinos from pp-III are in the 400-500 keV range, perhaps.

But the bands in the question are 700-800 (band1) and 800-900 (band2). So if the pp-III neutrinos are around 420 keV, which is below both bands. So the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to either band. So stopping pp-III would not affect the flux in bands 1 and 2. But wait, that can't be right, because the question says that the flux in those bands would change.

Hmm. Wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the energy ranges. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos are in the higher-energy range. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the neutrino types.

Wait, another possibility: neutrino flavor oscillations. But the note says that flavor changes don't play a role here. So we can ignore that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the neutrinos from the other branches of the pp chain. Wait, the question specifies that the pp-III branch stops, so maybe other pp branches (like pp-I and pp-II) continue.

Wait, the pp chain has several steps. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, and then in pp-II, the deuteron captures a proton to form tritium, which decays to helium-3, and then captures a proton to form helium-4. So the pp-III branch is the last step. So if pp-III stops, would the earlier steps continue?

Hmm, if the pp-III stops, then the earlier steps (like pp-I and pp-II) might not be able to proceed because the flow is blocked. But the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So perhaps, the only change is the pp-III stopped, so the other reactions (like CNO and pp-I, pp-II) continue.

Wait, but the pp chain is a chain reaction. If the last step stops, earlier steps may not proceed. Or maybe the Sun would adjust to a new equilibrium without the pp-III step.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's get back to the neutrino flux.

In the Sun, the main neutrinos come from the pp-III branch, emitting about 0.42 MeV (420 keV) neutrinos. The next main source is the CNO cycle, which produces higher-energy neutrinos, about 15.5 MeV (but I'm not certain about this number, maybe it's around 6 MeV? Or perhaps I'm mixing this up with the beta decay of Be-8. Let me think: Be-8 has a half-life of about 3e-17 seconds, and when it decays, it emits a positron and a neutrino. The mass of Be-8 is about 8.005518 u. The mass of He-4 is about 4.0026 u, so the decay is into two He-4 nuclei. The Q-value for this decay is about (8.005518 u - 2 *4.0026 u) times c². Let me calculate:

8.005518 - (2*4.0026) = 8.005518 -8.0052 = 0.000318 u. So about 0.000318 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ~0.295 MeV. So the neutrino would carry away about 0.295 MeV. That's about 295 keV. Wait, that's in the 700-800 keV band? No, it's below. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the CNO neutrinos are in the ~100 keV to a few MeV range. Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos are higher. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher in energy than those from the pp chain. So if the pp-III neutrinos are around 400 keV, and the CNO neutrinos are around 1-2 MeV, then bands 1 and 2 (700-800 and 800-900 keV) would be in between these two ranges.

Wait, but 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is higher than the 0.42 MeV from pp-III, but lower than the CNO neutrinos which might be in the 1-15 MeV range.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are at 420 keV, then these are below band 1 (700-800). So stopping pp-III wouldn't affect band 1, which is higher. But then, what about the CNO neutrinos?

Wait, the CNO neutrinos would have a higher energy. Let's say the CNO neutrinos are at about 1.5 MeV (1500 keV). So in that case, they would lie in band 2 (800-900 keV) is 0.8-0.9 MeV, and 1500 keV is higher than that. So they don't fall into either band. Hmm, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are in the 1-2 MeV range. So bands 1 and 2 are 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So CNO neutrinos are higher than band 2, so they don't fall into either. But then, why would the flux in bands 1 and 2 change if pp-III stopped?

Wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The pp-III process emits neutrinos with a certain energy, and those are the main contributors to the lower energy neutrino flux. If pp-III stops, then the main source of the lower-energy neutrinos stops, so the flux in the lower bands (like 700-800 keV) would decrease. But the higher-energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would be unaffected, since they're from the same source (pp-III) which is stopped.

Wait no, because if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 400 keV range, they don't contribute to the 700-800 keV band. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 would be determined by other sources, like the CNO cycle. But if the pp-III stopped, the CNO neutrinos are the only source.

Wait, but perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a broader energy spectrum, with some in the 700-800 keV range. Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with higher energies, so the CNO neutrinos are in a different part of the spectrum.

Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos don't contribute to the 700-800 keV band either. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the ratio of the same source's contributions in two different energy bands. So, for example, the pp-III neutrinos have a certain energy distribution, and if the pp-III stops, the flux in the lower bands would drop compared to the higher bands. But if the CNO neutrinos are also part of the same energy range, then their flux would be the same in both bands, leading to a ratio of 1.

Wait, but the question says that pp-III stopped, so the main source (pp-III) contributing to the lower-energy neutrinos (400 keV) is gone. So if the neutrinos from pp-III are at 420 keV, bands 1 and 2 (700-800, 800-900) are higher. So pp-III doesn't contribute to them. So the only neutrinos in those bands would be from the CNO cycle.

Wait, but if CNO neutrinos are higher than 900 keV, then the bands 1 and 2 would have very little or no neutrinos. So the flux in both bands would drop significantly. But the question is about the ratio, so perhaps the ratio remains the same as before, or perhaps it changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks at higher energies but also have a tail that extends into the 700-800 keV range. So in that case, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be lower than band 2 (800-900) if the CNO neutrinos are harder (higher energy) spectrum. So the ratio F1/F2 would be less than 1.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio after the pp-III branch stops. Before the stop, the pp-III neutrinos contributed to the lower energy bands, which are below the bands in question. So if pp-III stops, the only neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 are from the CNO cycle.

But if the CNO neutrinos are at higher energies, then perhaps in the 800-900 keV band, there's more flux than in the 700-800 keV band. So F2 (800-900) would have a higher flux than F1 (700-800) because the CNO neutrinos peak higher. So F1/F2 would be less than 1.

Alternatively, if the CNO neutrinos have a flux that is higher at lower energies in the bands, perhaps F1 is higher than F2, leading to F1/F2 >1.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy distributions. Let's think about the neutrino spectra.

In the pp-III process, the neutrinos are emitted with a specific energy, about 0.42 MeV. So they are in the 400 keV range. So they don't contribute to bands 1 and 2, which are 700-800 and 800-900 keV.

The CNO neutrinos come from the CNO cycle. The dominant neutrino emission in the CNO cycle is from the decay of Be-7. Be-7 is produced in the CNO cycle and captures a proton to become Boron-8, which then decays into Be-8 and emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 15.5 MeV, which is way above the bands in the question. So those neutrinos would not contribute to bands 1 and 2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if the CNO neutrinos are at 15 MeV, they are way higher than the bands in the question. So then, what sources contribute to the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands?

Alternatively, perhaps there's another neutrino source within the Sun that contributes to these bands. For example, maybe the decay of heavier elements or other fusion byproducts. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. The Sun's neutrino emission isn't just from the main pp-III and CNO cycles. There are also other processes, like the decay of He-3 or other isotopes, but I don't remember the details.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. If the pp-III branch stops, then the main neutrino source (pp-III) is gone. So the neutrino flux in all bands would drop, but perhaps the ratio between band 1 and band 2 depends on the relative contributions of different sources.

Wait, but the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO cycle continues, but the pp-III stops. So the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are still present, but what are their energy ranges?

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are in a higher energy range than the pp-III neutrinos. So after stopping pp-III, the remaining neutrinos (from CNO) are in higher energies. So, in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands, the CNO neutrinos would have a certain flux.

If the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that is higher on average, then the higher energy band (800-900 keV) would have more flux than the lower band (700-800 keV). So F1 (700-800) / F2 (800-900) would be less than 1. So the ratio would be something like 0.1 or 0.01.

Wait, that would make the ratio either 10, 1, 0.1, or 0.01. So if F1 is less than F2, the ratio is 0.1 or 0.01.

But I'm not exactly sure how the CNO neutrino spectrum looks. Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum, meaning they are more numerous at higher energies. So band 2 would have more neutrinos than band 1, leading to F1/F2 <1.

If the ratio is 0.1, that's option D. If it's 0.01, that's option B.

Alternatively, perhaps without the pp-III neutrinos, the only neutrinos in these bands are from the CNO cycle. And the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in higher energy bands, so F2 > F1. So F1/F2 would be 0.1 or 0.01.

I think the CNO neutrinos have a higher energy spectrum, so the flux in the higher band (800-900) would be higher than the lower band (700-800). Let's say the CNO neutrino flux is higher in band 2 than band 1. So F1 is lower than F2, so F1/F2 is about 0.1 or 0.01.

But how much would the flux change? What was the ratio before the pp-III stopped?

Before, the pp-III neutrinos were contributing to the lower energy bands (like <700 keV), and the CNO neutrinos contribute to higher bands. So in bands 1 and 2, the main contributors were the CNO neutrinos.

Wait, but if the pp-III stopped, the CNO flux remains the same, but the pp-III neutrinos were not in these bands anyway. So the ratio would stay the same as before.

Wait, that can't be right because the question is about the ratio changing after the pp-III stopped. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, but all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO neutrino production continues.

Assuming that the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are the main contributors to the bands 1 and 2, and that the CNO neutrinos have a higher energy distribution, then the flux in band 2 would be higher than band 1. So the ratio F1/F2 would be less than 1.

But if the CNO neutrinos have a roughly similar flux in both bands, the ratio would be near 1. Alternatively, if the CNO neutrinos are in a power-law spectrum, the flux would decrease with increasing energy, so band 2 would have less flux than band 1, making F1/F2 >1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the neutrino spectra again.

In the Sun, the dominant neutrinos come from the pp-III process, which are around 420 keV. The CNO neutrinos are from a different process and are higher energy, perhaps around 15 MeV. So the CNO neutrinos are in a much higher energy range than the bands in the question.

Wait, but then the bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV wouldn't have any neutrinos from either pp-III or CNO. So the flux in these bands would be zero, making the ratio undefined. But the question says the flux is still present.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the CNO neutrino energies. Let me check my notes. The CNO neutrinos are from the decay of Be-8, which emits a neutrino when it decays into two He-4 nuclei. The Q-value for that decay is about 0.295 MeV (as I calculated earlier). So the neutrinos from Be-8 decay are about 0.295 MeV, which is 295 keV. That's below band 1 (700 keV). So if the CNO neutrinos are at 295 keV, then bands 1 and 2 are higher than that. So the CNO neutrinos don't contribute to bands 1 and 2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the CNO cycle contributes about 1% of the Sun's energy, but the pp-III contributes 99%. So if the CNO neutrinos are at 295 keV, then the only neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band would be from other sources. But what other sources?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the Q-value. Let me recalculate the decay of Be-8.

Be-8 has a mass of approximately 8.005518 u. He-4 has 4.0026 u. So when two He-4 nuclei are formed from Be-8, the mass difference is 8.005518 - 2*4.0026 = 8.005518 -8.0052 = 0.000318 u.

Convert that to energy: 0.000318 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 0.295 MeV, which is about 295 keV. So the neutrino from this decay is about 295 keV. So the CNO neutrinos are in the 295 keV range, which is below band 1 (700 keV). So if the pp-III stopped, the only neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 would be from any other sources.

Wait, but then where do the neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 come from? Are there any other sources in the Sun?

Perhaps there are other processes, like the decay of heavier elements or other fusion byproducts. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the pp-III neutrinos have a higher energy than I thought.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the pp-III neutrinos with the CNO neutrinos. Let me think again. The pp-III process is: p + p → ²H + e+ + ν_e. The Q-value for this reaction is about 420 keV. So the neutrino energy is around 420 keV. So the pp-III neutrinos are in the 400-500 keV range. So they don't contribute to bands 1 and 2, which are above 700 keV.

So if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 would come solely from the CNO cycle. But if the CNO neutrinos are at 295 keV, then they don't contribute to bands 1 and 2. So the flux in both bands would drop to zero, making the ratio zero. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the question is about the change in the neutrino flux in bands 1 and 2 due to the pp-III stopping. But if the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to these bands, then the flux wouldn't change, and the ratio would remain the same. So the ratio would be the same as before.

Wait, but the question is asking what the ratio would be after the pp-III stopped. So perhaps the pp-III neutrinos only contributed to lower energy bands, and the CNO neutrinos contribute to higher. So the ratio of fluxes in bands 1 and 2 would be determined by the CNO neutrinos.

If the CNO neutrinos have a higher energy distribution, then band 2 (800-900) would have a higher flux than band 1 (700-800). So F1/F2 would be less than 1. If the CNO neutrinos are in a range that's higher than band 2, then band 2 would have negligible flux, making F1/F2 either 0 or undefined.

But since the question is about the ratio, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a flux that is about the same in both bands, making the ratio approximately 1. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in band 2 than in band 1, so the ratio F1/F2 is about 0.1 (option D).

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum where flux decreases with energy. So higher energy bands have less flux. Then F1/F2 would be greater than 1. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: think about the energy spectrum. The solar neutrino flux peaks around 400 keV (from pp-III). If the pp-III stops, then the main peak is gone. The CNO neutrinos are at a higher energy (around 295 keV?), but if that's the case, then they don't contribute to the bands 1 and 2.

But wait, 295 keV is still below 700 keV. So without pp-III, the neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 would come from other sources, but I don't know any.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the pp-III neutrinos, but that can't be because if they're stopped, their contribution would be zero.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the neutrinos from the CNO cycle, which have a higher energy than the pp-III neutrinos. So after the pp-III stops, the CNO neutrinos are the only source. If the CNO neutrinos have a higher energy, their flux would be higher in band 2 than band 1, leading to F1/F2 <1.

But if the CNO neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV range, then F1 would be higher than F2, leading to F1/F2 >1.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a broad spectrum, with a higher flux in the 700-800 keV band than in 800-900. So F1/F2 would be greater than 1.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If F1 is higher, F1/F2 is 10 or 1.

If F1 is lower, F1/F2 is 0.1 or 0.01.

If the CNO neutrinos are in the 700-800 range, then F1 would be higher than F2, leading to a ratio of 10 (option A) or 1 (option C).

But I thought the CNO neutrinos are at lower energies, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are in the ~500 keV to ~1 MeV range. So band 1 is 700-800, which is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and band 2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV. So CNO neutrinos would be in these bands.

So if the CNO neutrinos have a higher flux in band 2 than band 1, then F1/F2 is less than 1.

Alternatively, if the CNO neutrino flux is higher in band 1, then F1/F2 is greater than 1.

But I'm not sure about the exact distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that decreases with energy, meaning that the flux is higher at lower energies. So in the 700-800 keV band, the flux is higher than in 800-900. So F1/F2 would be greater than 1, like 10 (option A).

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos have a flat flux in these bands, leading to a ratio of 1.

But I think the correct answer is that the ratio remains the same as before, because the CNO neutrinos are the only contributors, and their spectrum doesn't vary much in these bands.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think of this in another way.

The pp-III neutrinos are in the 400 keV range, so they don't contribute to bands 1 and 2. The CNO neutrinos are higher. So after the pp-III stops, the only neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 are from CNO.

If the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that's higher on average, then the flux in band 2 would be higher than band 1, leading to F1/F2 = 0.1. So option D.

Alternatively, if the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that's lower, the flux in band 1 is higher, leading to F1/F2 =10 (option A).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of neutrinos at higher energies is less than at lower energies because the production rate decreases with energy. So the CNO neutrinos, being higher energy, would have a lower flux in band 2 than band 1. So F1/F2 would be greater than 1.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a similar flux in both bands, leading to a ratio of 1 (option C).

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos contribute more to band 2, making the ratio F1/F2 lower than 1.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me make a guess.

If the CNO neutrinos are harder (higher energy), then F2 would have more flux than F1, making F1/F2 =0.1 (option D).

But I'm not certain.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core hypothetically stops, while all other reactions remain unchanged. The pp-III branch is the primary source of solar neutrinos, producing neutrinos with an energy of approximately 420 keV. These neutrinos fall below the energy range of the specified bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV). Therefore, the pp-III neutrinos do not contribute to the flux in these bands.

The CNO cycle, which continues unaffected, produces neutrinos with higher energies. The dominant neutrino emission in the CNO cycle comes from the decay of beryllium-8 (Be-8), which emits a neutrino with an energy of approximately 295 keV. However, this energy is still below the specified bands. There may be contributions from higher-energy neutrinos in the CNO cycle, but these are not explicitly detailed in the question. Assuming the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks at higher energies, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) is likely higher than in the 700-800 keV band (band 1).

If the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that decreases with energy, the flux in band 1 would be higher than in band 2, leading to a ratio \( F_1/F_2 > 1 \). Conversely, if the CNO neutrinos have a harder spectrum (higher flux at higher energies), the flux in band 2 would be higher, resulting in a ratio \( F_1/F_2 < 1 \). Given the ambiguity in the exact energy distribution of CNO neutrinos, the most reasonable assumption is that the flux decreases with energy, leading to a ratio \( F_1/F_2 = 0.1 \).

ANSWER: D
