Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible interactions that can occur at high energies, but when the energy scale is much lower than those high energies, these interactions are suppressed. So the operators in SMEFT are constrained by certain symmetries.

I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of them. Because in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. So any operator in SMEFT should also respect this. So 1 is a must.

Wait, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time uniformly). But isn't Poincare symmetry automatically included when we use the usual methods in QFT, like requiring the theory to be invariant under diffeomorphisms? Or maybe not exactly. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's built by expanding around the SM, which already respects Poincare. So I think all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, meaning 2 is also correct. So 1 and 2 would both be correct, making option A (1,2) a possibility, but wait, looking back at the options, let me see.

Wait, but wait, another thought: SMEFT is constructed to include all possible higher-dimensional operators that are invariant under the gauge symmetries of the SM. But gauge symmetries are a subset of the Poincare group? No, not exactly. But I think the SMEFT operators are built to be Lorentz invariant because the SM is Lorentz invariant and SMEFT arises as an expansion. So yes, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1 is correct), and Poincare symmetry (2) as well. But wait, Poincare symmetry includes translations. Does SMEFT require operators to be translationally invariant? Because operators in a QFT are typically translationally invariant, so yes, I think 2 is correct too.

Wait, but wait, the SMEFT is constructed as a theory that includes all possible terms respecting the SM gauge symmetry. However, the SM itself respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must too. So both 1 and 2 are required.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because sometimes people talk about SMEFT respecting Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily other symmetries like charge conjugation or parity. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely there. So what about the other options.

Now, what about CP symmetry? Do SMEFT operators have to respect CP? I think not necessarily. Because the Standard Model itself doesn't respect CP symmetry (like in the CKM matrix leading to CP violation). So operators in SMEFT can have CP violation. So 3, CP symmetry, is not necessarily respected by all operators. So 3 is not a must; some operators in SMEFT might violate CP, hence 3 isn't a required symmetry.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is a big one. I remember that
