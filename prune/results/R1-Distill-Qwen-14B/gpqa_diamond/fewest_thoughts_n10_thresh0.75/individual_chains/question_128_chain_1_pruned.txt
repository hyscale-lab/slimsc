Okay, so I've just started my new job in a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21 and purify it quickly. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to figure out which plasmid to use. 

Hmm, the key here is to look at the plasmid sequences. I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid must have a strong promoter, the right ribosome binding sites, and perhaps some tags for purification. Also, E. coli uses certain codon preferences, so the plasmid should ideally be optimized for that.

Looking at the options, all of them start with ATG, which is the start codon methionine. But wait, what about the restriction sites? The sequence includes 'CATGG' which might be a start codon followed by a restriction enzyme site. Oh, wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSD..., so the first amino acid is Met (from ATG). 

I think the plasmid should contain the correct reading frame and the right promoter. The E. coli strain BL21 is often used because it lacks certain factors, like the Lon protease, which helps in protein stability. But the plasmid needs to have an inducible promoter, like T7, which BL21 cells support because they have the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter (like lacUV5).

Looking at the plasmid options, I'm noticing that the sequences start with ATGGAGGAGCC... which is the start codon
