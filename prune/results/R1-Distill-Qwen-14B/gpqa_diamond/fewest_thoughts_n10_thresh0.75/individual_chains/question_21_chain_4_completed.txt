Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. So, it's about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Part B is about which of the given compounds shows optical isomerism.

So let's break it down. The compounds given are benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and dimethyl fumarate.

First, I need to tackle part A: which of the two compounds (benzoquinone vs cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between two structures with the movement of a hydrogen and the change of a double bond. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group (keto form) can tautomerize to an enol form. This requires adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Benzene is a planar structure with conjugated double bonds. So each of the ketones is part of a conjugated system. But wait, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm a bit confused. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. Each oxygen is attached to a benzene ring. Wait, no, benzoquinone is two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene. So the structure is like O=C6H4=O? Or is it more like a cyclohexadienedione?

Wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So it's O=C6H4=O, perhaps in the para positions. But does it have any possibility for tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent H's and double bonds. Hmm, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring. The ring has conjugated double bonds, but each carbonyl is a ketone group. For tautomerism, we need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. Maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups because the ring is fully conjugated. Wait, wait, no. Benzoquinone is something like 1,4-benzoquinone, which has the structure O=C6H4=O, with the two oxygens in the para positions. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl would be part of the ring, which is sp² hybridized. So any hydrogens attached to those carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6, 3 and 5) are each attached to a hydrogen. But wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to a hydrogen unless substituted. So in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl oxygens are in the para positions, and each adjacent carbon (like positions 2 and 3) have hydrogens. But wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is either CH or substituted. In this case, the two carbonyl groups are in para, so the adjacent carbons (like 2 and 3, 5 and 6) would have CH groups. So, wait, the structure is O=C-C6H2-C-O=O? No, wait, no, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So each of the carbonyls is attached to the ring, but the ring itself is fully conjugated. So each of the carbonyl carbons is double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to the ring. The adjacent carbons in the ring have hydrogens.

Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl (C=O) is attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbon (like in the ring) has a hydrogen. So, could it undergo keto-enol tautomerism? Because the hydrogen is on the adjacent carbon, but the problem is that in the ring, the structure is rigid. So maybe it's not possible because the necessary conjugation or because the hydrogen isn't in the right position. Or perhaps because the ring is fully conjugated, and the keto group can't shift because the adjacent positions are already double bonds. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't exhibit tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't allow for the necessary hydrogen shift. 

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So, the structure is like O=C-O=C-O=C in a cyclohexane ring. Wait, no, more accurately, the ring has three carbonyl groups at alternate positions. So, the structure is (O=C)C-C(=O)-C-C(=O)-C-C, connected in a ring. Now, for tautomerism, each carbonyl group has adjacent hydrogens. Because the ring is cyclohexane, the positions between the carbonyls are CH2 groups. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me think again: cyclohexane has six carbons. If three are carbonyls (so positions 1,3,5), then each of these is C=O, and the adjacent carbons (2,4,6) are CH2 or CH groups?

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So each of these is a C=O group. The adjacent positions (2,4,6) are each CH2 groups because the ring has to be connected. So each of those positions is a CH2, meaning that each C=O is next to a CH2. So each CH2 group has two hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, for tautomerism to occur, the structure needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So in this case, each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl. So, for example, in position 2, the carbon is attached to the carbonyl at position 1, and another at position 3. So each of these positions has two hydrogens. The possibility of tautomerism would be if a hydrogen can shift, leading to enol formation. However, in a trione, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. I'm thinking that in such a case, tautomerism is possible. For example, in 1,3,5-trione, each CH2 group is between two carbonyls, so the H's on the CH2 could potentially tautomerize, but the structure would become more complicated. Wait, but for enol tautomerism, the H must be alpha to the carbonyl. So in each CH2 group, each H is alpha to two carbonyls. So the possibility exists for each of these H's to form an enol structure. But wait, with three carbonyl groups, how would that work? Maybe it's possible, but perhaps it's not very stable. Or perhaps the compound doesn't undergo tautomerism because the structure is too rigid to allow such a shift.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about which of the two compounds can undergo tautomerism. Benzoquinone, being a benzene ring with two ketones in para positions, doesn't have any hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl groups because the adjacent positions are part of the aromatic ring. Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is adjacent, but in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons (to the carbonyl) are CH groups. So, each C=O is attached to a CH group (from the benzene ring). So, each CH has a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. That would mean that benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, in an aromatic system, the delocalization makes such shifts difficult. Because the ring is fully conjugated, moving a hydrogen would disrupt that conjugation. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the necessary hydrogen isn't present or because the structure is too rigid. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize, but it's less likely.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of examples. For example, cyclopentanone can undergo tautomerism if there's a hydrogen in the right position. But wait, cyclopentanone is a cyclic ketone, and if there's a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, then it can tautomerize. But in the case of benzoquinone, the adjacent carbon to the carbonyl is part of the benzene ring, which is sp² hybridized. So the hydrogen is on an sp² carbon. For keto-enol tautomerism, the hydrogen is typically on an sp³ carbon. Because in enol form, the double bond is between two sp² carbons. So if the adjacent carbon is sp², can the hydrogen shift?

Wait, maybe in aromatic systems, the keto-enol tautomerism is not possible, so benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. Because the hydrogen is on an sp² carbon, which doesn't allow for the necessary shift. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism because each CH2 is between two carbonyls, so each H is on a sp³ carbon, allowing for tautomerization.

Wait, but in the trione, each CH2 is between two carbonyls, so each hydrogen is alpha to two carbonyls. So, in theory, each H can shift, but that's a lot of possibilities. But I'm not sure if that leads to tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe neither of the compounds shows tautomerism. But that can't be right because the question says one doesn't.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the adjacent H is on an sp² carbon, making enol formation impossible. Because enol requires the H to be on an sp³ carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. So benzoquinone's structure wouldn't allow that.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has CH2 groups between the carbonyls, so each H is on an sp³ carbon, adjacent to a carbonyl. So each H could shift, leading to enol tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, whereas benzoquinone cannot.

So for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says among the two given compounds. The compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So which of these does not show tautomerism? If benzoquinone doesn't, then A is benzoquinone. So the answer for A is benzoquinone.

Now, moving on to part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which will show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, compounds with internal planes of symmetry might not have optical isomerism, but if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can have enantiomers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's write the structure. It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The structure is:

O
||O
O-C-OCH3
   |
   C-O
   |
   CH2-OH

Wait, no, the correct structure is: the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2COOH. But wait, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, position 2 is the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(COOH)CH2OH? Wait, no, perhaps it's HOCH2COOCH3 when esterified with methanol. Wait, no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-O-Me

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-O-CH3.

So the molecule is CH3-C(O)-O-CH3? No, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH?), no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that's not right. The correct structure for propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Then, when esterified with methanol, the hydroxyl (-OH) is replaced by OCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)OCH3.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is more accurately:

The acid is HOCH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes HOCH2COOCH3. But wait, that's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure: the carboxylic acid is on carbon 3, the hydroxyl on carbon 2, and the ester is on carbon 3. So the molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I should number the propanoate. Propanoate is three carbons: COO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the ester is formed from the acid. So methyl propanoate would be CH3CH2COOCH3. But methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, that's possible. So in this molecule, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- a methyl group (from the CH2 group),
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- and another CH2 group (the one attached to the COOCH3).

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon (the CH2 with OH) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's see: the second carbon is connected to:

- one OH,
- two CH2 groups (from CH2-OH and CH2-COOCH3),
- and the third group is the COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Another approach: the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH3

No, that's not right. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Now, looking for a chiral center. The central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from CH3-),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the adjacent CH group.

Wait, but the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (which is part of the adjacent CH2 or something else? No, wait. Let's imagine the structure: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent CH, which is connected to another CH3.

Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (second carbon) has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon from the COOCH3. Wait, no. The central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and the carbon that's part of the COOCH3 group is another CH2? No, wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So in this case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the carbon from the COOCH3 is connected to another CH3 (from the ester group). Wait, no. The COOCH3 is O-C-OCH3. So the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (but that's the same as the CH3 group? No, perhaps it's a single bond to the next carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the substituents on the central carbon. It's connected to:

- a methyl group (CH3),
- a hydroxyl group (OH),
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- and another carbon, which is the one from the COOCH3. So wait, the substituents are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond to the next carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, because in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon would have:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent CH (but that's the same as the CH3 group? No, the adjacent is another CH group connected to the COOCH3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. No, because that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Then, the central carbon is the first CH2. But that structure would have two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the CHOH) is bonded to:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the next carbon (the one from COOCH3), which is the same as the CH3 from the ester.

Wait, no, the COOCH3 is O-C-OCH3. So the central carbon is bonded to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent CH (which is part of the COOCH3 group). So the adjacent group is the carbonyl.

But wait, in this case, the central carbon may not have four different groups. Because the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single bond to another carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group). Wait, but that means that the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group). So the four substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a CH (which is connected to the carbonyl). Does that count as four different groups?

Alternatively, maybe the central carbon has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen? No, because in the structure CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the central carbon is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (from the COOCH3), which is a carbonyl group. Wait, but the central carbon is connected to the carbonyl carbon via a single bond. So the substituents are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the adjacent carbon (which is a carbonyl group), but that's a different group than the others. Hmm, perhaps that makes the central carbon a chiral center, resulting in optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon isn't a chiral center because two substituents are the same. But in this case, the substituents are all different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH. So, the central carbon is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism.

Now, looking at the other compound: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, more accurately, it's (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, I think it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Now, looking for a chiral center. In this molecule, all the carbons are either part of the double bond or part of the ester groups. The central double bond has two carbonyl groups on opposite sides. Are there any chiral centers here?

Wait, the central carbons are each attached to two ester groups, a double bond, and two other carbons. Let me imagine the structure: each of the two central carbons (from the double bond) is connected to two ester groups (O-C-OCH3) and two other carbons. Wait, so each of these carbons is bonded to two ester groups and the two CH2 groups. No, the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2 with a double bond between the central carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure as:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond in between, making it CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) → no, that can't be because that would require four substituents. Wait, no. The correct structure is:

O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O=C-OCH3

So, each of the two central carbons is double-bonded to each other, and each has two ester groups attached. So each of these carbons is connected to two ester groups, a double bond, and possibly another substituent.

Wait, wait. Let me think: fumarate is the trans ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, and fumarate is the trans di-ester. So dimethyl fumarate would be MeO2CCHCHCO2Me, with the two methyl esters on opposite sides of the double bond.

Each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two ester groups and two other carbons. Wait, each is attached to:

- one ester group (MeO),
- another ester group (MeO),
- and two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Each of the two central carbons is bonded to two ester groups (O-C-OCH3), a double bond, and another carbon. So each has four substituents: two are O-C-OCH3, one is a double bond to the other carbon, and the fourth is another substituent (like CH2 or similar). Wait, no. Wait, each central carbon is connected to two ester groups, a double bond, and a CH2 group. No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, each central carbon is part of the double bond and has two ester groups attached. So each has two ester groups, a double bond, and another substituent. Let me imagine each central carbon as a CH group. So, each has:

- two ester groups (O-C-OCH3),
- a double bond to the other central carbon,
- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. The correct structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)

But connected by a double bond. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible because that would imply a single bond. Alternatively, each CH is connected to two ester groups and a double bond. So each has two ester groups, a double bond, and a single bond to another CH group. But that would make each CH connected to three substituents, which isn't possible. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3. No, but that's not a double bond. Wait, no, fumarate is an unsaturated diacid. So the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, but with double bonds. Wait, no. I think I'm mixing up maleic and fumaric acids.

Wait, maleic acid is cis with double bond between the two middle carbons, and fumaric acid is trans. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So each of the two central carbons is attached to two ester groups and a double bond. Each central carbon has four substituents: two O-C-OCH3 groups, a double bond to the other carbon, and a single bond to another O-C-OCH3? No, that can't be. Wait, each central carbon is connected to two ester groups and a double bond. So each has two ester groups, a double bond, and another substituent. But what's the other substituent? Hmm, perhaps each is connected to a hydrogen as well.

Wait, no, in fumarate, the structure is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) → no, that's a single bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that's not right.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making it hard to determine the presence of a chiral center. Let me think differently. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and the two ester groups on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetric along the double bond. Therefore, it doesn't have any chiral centers because any potential chiral centers would be mirror images due to the symmetry.

Wait, no, because if the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and doesn't have optical isomerism. But in dimethyl fumarate, each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to two ester groups. So each has two identical substituents (ester groups), a double bond, and another identical substituent. So the molecule is symmetrical, and thus, no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, for part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism because it has a chiral center, while dimethyl fumarate does not because it's symmetrical and lacks a chiral center.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it would exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being symmetric, doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So putting it together:

A) The compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate. So B would be incorrect.

Option A: A is cyclohexane... which would be incorrect for A.

Option B: A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That fits.

Option C: A is cyclohexane, which is incorrect.

So the correct option is B: A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism. So in the options, the correct choice for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct options are:

A) Benzoquinone.
B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options, option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the answer is option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the given question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between two structures by moving a hydrogen atom and a double bond. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. The carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic system, and the adjacent carbons are sp² hybridized. For tautomerism to occur, a hydrogen atom must be on an sp³ carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, the hydrogens are on sp² carbons, making tautomerism impossible. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbonyl carbons are separated by CH₂ groups, which are sp³ hybridized. Each CH₂ group has hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (E)-CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH₂(COOCH₃), with a double bond between the two central carbons. The molecule is symmetrical, with identical substituents on both sides of the double bond. Due to this symmetry, there are no chiral centers, and the compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- **B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B
