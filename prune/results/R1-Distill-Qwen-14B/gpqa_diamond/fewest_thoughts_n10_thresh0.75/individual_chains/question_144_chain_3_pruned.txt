Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some very small distances.

Wait, I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't live forever. It decays after some time, right? So the mean decay distance depends on how long it lives on average and how fast it's moving.

But wait, the problem gives me the production energy. So maybe I should find the velocity of the meson first. Because if it's moving quickly, it will travel a longer distance before decaying.

I think the first step is to find the meson's momentum. Oh right, relativistic equations are needed here. The energy E is related to mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since the units are in GeV and the mass is given, maybe I can work in natural units where c=1.

Wait, natural units would make this easier. So in natural units, E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So let's compute p.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p squared is E squared minus m squared. Let's compute that:

E² = (8)^2 = 64 (GeV²)
m² = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV²)
So p² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV². So p is sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let me calculate that: sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91 GeV. So p ≈7.91 GeV.

Next, I think I need to find the velocity. The relativistic relation between momentum and velocity is p = gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, in natural units where c=1, the equation simplifies. Hmm, but I think I can find the velocity from the relation between energy and mass.

Alternatively, the gamma factor is E/(m c²), but since c=1, it's E/m. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Wait, but beta (β) is v/c. So beta can be found from the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let's solve for beta.

gamma = 6.6667 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)
So sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/6.6667 ≈ 0.15
Squaring both sides: 1 - beta² = 0.0225
So beta² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775
beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

So the speed is about 98.87% the speed of light. That's really fast.

Now, the next part is about the decay. The mean lifetime (proper lifetime) of the particle is related to its width. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is connected to the particle's lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, what units are we using here?

Wait, Γ is given in MeV. Oh, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me recall that ħ in natural units (GeV·s) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J, and ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Wait, maybe I should convert Γ from MeV to GeV. Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute that. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but this is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But the meson is moving, so we need to calculate the dilated lifetime. That's where gamma comes in. So the actual lifetime τ' = gamma * τ.

So τ' = gamma * 2.056875e-24 s. Gamma was 6.6667, so 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. So distance d = v * τ'.

But wait, v is 0.9887c, where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So d = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e
