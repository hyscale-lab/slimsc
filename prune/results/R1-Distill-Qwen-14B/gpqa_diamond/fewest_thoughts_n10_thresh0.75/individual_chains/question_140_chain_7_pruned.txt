Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice science question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, let me start breaking this down.

First, let's think about the reaction. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. A violent reaction could indicate something like a strong acid reacting with a carbonate, or maybe a metal reacting with an acid. The gas released, W, has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So each molecule of W has equal neutrons and protons. 

Wait, same number of neutrons and protonsâ€”so the atom it's composed of must have equal numbers? So the molecule is made of an element with same protons and neutrons. For example, hydrogen (1 proton, 1 neutron in some isotopes) but that's probably not the case. Maybe something like CH4? No, that's four H's, so each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron. But wait, CH4 is a molecule, but in this case, the gas W is a molecule where each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe W is a molecule where each atom in it has same number of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps each molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, CO2 has 12 (C:6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 32 (O:8 protons, 8 neutrons each) but that might not fit. Wait, perhaps W is CO2. Let me think, C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it
