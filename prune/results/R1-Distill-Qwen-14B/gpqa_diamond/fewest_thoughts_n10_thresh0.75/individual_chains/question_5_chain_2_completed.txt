Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Right, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

First, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to get a clear picture.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's like the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled the same way.

And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So that's the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

Wait, the operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane. That means it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle. Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

The operator vector P is given by the vector components Px, Py, Pz. So the total operator P would be the dot product of the direction vector n and the Pauli matrices, scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, actually, the operator should be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector components. So P = n_x * Px + n_y * Py + n_z * Pz. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x * Px + n_z * Pz.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ (assuming that φ is zero since it's in the x-z plane, so θ is the angle from the z-axis). So P = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Let me compute this matrix. Px and Pz are given as:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So sinθ * Px would be (ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
And cosθ * Pz is (ħ/2) * cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding them together:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ * 1, sinθ * 1 ],
              [ sinθ * 1, -cosθ * 1 ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, when you add the two matrices, the (1,1) element is from Pz: (ħ/2) * cosθ * 1, and (2,2) is from Pz: (ħ/2) * (-1) * cosθ. The (1,2) and (2,1) elements come from Px, which is (ħ/2) * sinθ.

So the matrix becomes:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
              [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, that's correct? Let me check. The (1,1) element is (ħ/2) * (0 + cosθ * 1 * 1) ? No, wait. Let me think again. Each component:

P = (ħ/2) [ (0 * sinθ) + (1 * cosθ) ) , (1 sinθ) + (0 * cosθ) ) ]
Wait, no, that's not correct. The matrices Px and Pz are each multiplied by sinθ and cosθ, respectively, and then added.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write them out:

sinθ * Px = (ħ/2) * sinθ * [ [0,1], [1,0] ]
cosθ * Pz = (ħ/2) * cosθ * [ [1,0], [0,-1] ]

Now, adding these two matrices:

Top-left element: 0*sinθ + 1*cosθ → cosθ
Top-right: 1*sinθ + 0 → sinθ
Bottom-left: same as top-right, so sinθ
Bottom-right: (-1)*cosθ + 0 → -cosθ

So yes, P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, because the (1,1) element is from cosθ, and (2,2) is -cosθ. So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

So that's the operator P.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvector of this P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2.

So, to find the eigenvector, I need to solve the equation P |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Let me denote the vector |v> as a column vector [ a; b ].

So, I'll set up the equation P * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Which gives two equations:

( (ħ/2) cosθ ) a + ( (ħ/2) sinθ ) b = (ħ/2) a
( (ħ/2) sinθ ) a + ( -(ħ/2) cosθ ) b = (ħ/2) b

I can divide both sides of each equation by ħ/2 to simplify:

First equation:
cosθ a + sinθ b = a
=> (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Second equation:
sinθ a - cosθ b = b
=> sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

So now I have two equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Let me write these equations as:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
Equation 2: sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b

Hmm, perhaps I can express a in terms of b from each equation and see if they are consistent.

From equation 1: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

From equation 2: a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

So set them equal:

[ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ]

Multiply both sides by (cosθ -1) * sinθ to eliminate denominators:

- sinθ * sinθ = (cosθ + 1)(cosθ -1)

Left side: - sin²θ
Right side: cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ

So both sides are equal. That's consistent. So the equations are dependent. So we can choose a ratio for a and b.

Let me pick equation 2: sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

Let me let b = 1 (as a parameter), then a = (cosθ +1)/sinθ.

Wait, but if I let b = 1, then a is (cosθ +1)/sinθ. Hmm, but what if sinθ is zero? Well, sinθ is zero when θ is 0 or π, but in that case, the direction would be along z. But let's proceed.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ , 1 ]

Wait, but let's see. Let me factor this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write cosθ +1 as 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ as 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Because I remember that:

cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) -1 → cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So substituting into a's expression:

a = [ 2 cos²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] * b

Simplify: numerator is 2 cos²(θ/2), denominator is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So 2 cancels, cos²(theta/2) / ( sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) → cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

So the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by b.

So let's choose b = sin(theta/2), then a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

So the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, wait. Let's see: if I let b = sin(theta/2), then a would be cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) ) * sin(theta/2) )= cos(theta/2).

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait: because the eigenvector is determined up to a scalar multiple, so perhaps this is the correct form.

But what about the normalization? Let's find the normalization factor.

The vector [ a, b ] must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2). So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1. Oh, so it's already normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, looking at the options:

Option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D has sqrt factors and more terms.

Wait, but wait a second. The operator P is in the direction (n_x, 0, n_z) because it's in the x-z plane. So the standard spin-1/2 system along an arbitrary direction. The eigenvectors for spin-up (eigenvalue +ħ/2) along direction n are given by the spin coherent state, which can be written in terms of theta and phi. But in our case, phi is zero since it's in x-z plane.

The general expression for the spin-up state along direction (theta, phi) is:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

In our case, phi is 0, so it becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the eigenvector should be ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches option C.

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

But the eigenvector I found is option C.

But wait, the question says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". So I think option C is correct.

Wait, but let me look at the other options again.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but the eigenvector's elements shouldn't have factors of ħ because ħ is in the operator; the eigenvector is dimensionless. So the options with ħ might be incorrect.

So option D includes ħ, which is probably wrong because eigenvectors are unit vectors. So option C is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ is the dot product of the direction vector $\vec{n}$ and the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute. Thus, $\vec{P}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}$ into the equation, we get two equations:
1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$,
2. $\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0$.

These equations are consistent, and solving them yields the ratio $a/b = \cot(\theta/2)$. To normalize the eigenvector, we choose $a = \cos(\theta/2)$ and $b = \sin(\theta/2)$, ensuring that $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This is incorrect because the eigenvector elements should not include $\hbar$, as eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This is incorrect because the eigenvector components depend on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is correct.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This is incorrect because the eigenvector elements should not include $\hbar$, and the coefficients are not consistent with the derived solution.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
