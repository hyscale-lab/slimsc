Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, wait, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But the question gives bond energies, so maybe I should approach it using bond energies.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula: ΔHf° = Σ bond energies of reactants - Σ bond energies of products. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard approach is to consider the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. Oh wait, no, the enthalpy of formation is the opposite. Oh wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait. Another way: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by taking the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule, subtract the sum of the bond energies of the elements as they are (i.e., the bonds in the elements). Wait, no, maybe I should think about it as the total energy required to break all the bonds in the molecule minus the energy released when forming the bonds in the products.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to calculate the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule, then subtract the sum of the bond energies for the elements in their standard states (like elemental carbon and hydrogen). 

Wait, but in this case, the molecule is likely a hydrocarbon, so it's made up of C and H. The formula would be something like CnHm. So, the standard enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the bond energies of all the C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H bonds in the molecule, minus the sum of the bond energies for the elemental C and H.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy of formation being the energy required to form the molecule from its constituent atoms. So, to form the molecule, you first break apart the atoms into their constituent elements, which would involve their bond energies, and then form the bonds in the molecule.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula: ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in the molecule) - (sum of bond energies in the elements). But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a clearer approach.

Wait, the standard formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is as follows: 

ΔHf° = Σ (bonds broken) - Σ (bonds formed).

Wait, no, wait. Actually, bond energies are the energy required to break a bond. So, when forming a molecule from its elements, you have to break the bonds in the elements and then form the bonds in the compound. So, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the energies required to break the bonds in the elements minus the sum of the energies released when forming the bonds in the compound.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think. For example, when forming a molecule like CH4, you start with C and H2. The bonds in H2 and C are broken, and then the C-H bonds are formed. So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf° = [ (C atom bond energy) + 2*(H-H bond energy) ] - [4*(C-H bond energy)].

Wait, but wait, the bond energy of C (as an atom) is given here as 1000 kJ/mol. So, for each carbon atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol to break it into... wait, no, wait. Wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of an element into separate atoms. For carbon, which is in graphite or some standard state, the bond energy is 1000 kJ/mol. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each C-C bond in graphite is considered part of the standard state. But to form carbon atoms, you need to break C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule, subtract the bond energies that would be in the elements if they were in their standard states.

Wait, but the problem statement gives me bond energies for various bonds, and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. Hmm.

Wait, let me read the problem again. The question is to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, and the data provided includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon (1000 kJ/mol), bond energies for H-H (100), C-C (200), C=C (300), and C-H (400).

Wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of carbon (e.g., graphite) into separate atoms, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So, for each mole of carbon, breaking it into atoms requires 1000 kJ.

Hmm. So, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies as follows:

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) = [sum of bond energies in the molecule] - [sum of bond energies in the elements].

Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Because when you form a molecule, you're starting from the elements. So, you first break the bonds in the elements (which requires energy), and then form the bonds in the molecule (which releases energy). So, the overall enthalpy change is (energy to break bonds in elements) - (energy released when forming bonds in molecule).

But wait, the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for each carbon atom, the element is graphite, which has a certain structure. But the given data for C is the enthalpy of atomization, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So, maybe I need to consider each C atom as being separated from the element, which requires 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. Hmm, but wait, 1 mole of C atoms is 12 grams, right? Because carbon has a molar mass of 12 g/mol.

Wait, let me get back to the problem. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to count the number of each type of bond.

First, let's figure out the structure of this molecule. The formula is a bit complex, but let me try to count each bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each type of bond in the molecule.

So, let's count the number of each bond:

C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H.

Wait, but H-H bonds are probably not present in the molecule because it's an alkene and an alkyl structure. So, maybe H-H isn't part of the molecule. Let me proceed.

First, count the number of C atoms. Let's see:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has 4 carbons: two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is double-bonded to another CH group. Wait, actually, wait.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group is 3 carbons: the central C connected to two CH3 groups, and double-bonded to a CH group.

Then, each CH2 group is a single carbon, except when attached to other groups.

Wait, maybe it's better to count each C-C, C=C, and C-H bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the molecular formula first. Let's see.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is actually (CH3)2C=CH- as a substituent. But perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each part:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has:

Two CH3 groups: each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds. So, two CH3's contribute 2 * 3 =6 C-H bonds.

The central C in (CH3)2C=CH- is connected to two CH3 groups, one CH (double bond), and one single bond to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should write out the structure to find all the bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach by determining the molecular formula. Let's see:

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes 4 carbons (the C=CH part has 2 carbons, plus two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is the third C, so maybe 3? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count each group:

Each (CH3)2C=CH is:

- One C connected to two CH3 groups and a CH group (via a double bond). So, that's 1 + 2 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH) =4 carbons? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count all the C's.

Wait, the entire molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH: 3 carbons (the central C, two CH3, and the CH). But wait, perhaps it's better to count each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : this is 4 carbons. Because the structure is:

The central C is connected to two CH3 groups, and a double bond to a CH group. So, that's 1 (central) + 2 (from the two CH3) + 1 (from CH) =4 carbons.

Then, after that, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the next parts:

- CH2: 1 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH=C(CH3)2: the CH is connected to a C that is double-bonded (C=) and connected to two CH3 groups. So, that's 1 (CH) + 1 (the C=) + 2 (from the two CH3) =4 carbons. Wait, no, the CH=C(CH3)2 is one C (connected to the CH2) double bonded to another C, which has two CH3 groups. So that's 3 carbons: the CH, the C=, and the two CH3's attached to the C=.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just count the number of each type of bond.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each type of bond:

C-C bonds: each single bond between two carbons.

C=C bonds: each double bond between two carbons.

C-H bonds: each single bond between C and H.

H-H bonds: unlikely to be present in the molecule.

Wait, but perhaps I can think about it this way:

Each molecule has a certain number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. Let's count each:

C=C bonds: How many double bonds are in the molecule? Let's see:

Looking at the formula, there's a C=CH group and another C=CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I should look for each C=C in the formula.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the double bonds are between the (CH3)2C and the CH, and another between the CH and the next CH2? Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, which is a double bond between the central C and the CH group. Then, after that, it's a single bond to CH2, then another CH(CH3), another CH2, then a CH connected via another double bond to C(CH3)2.

So, total of two C=C bonds in the molecule.

Wait, that makes sense. So, two double bonds.

Now, for each C=C bond, the bond energy is 300 kJ/mol.

Next, C-C bonds: each single bond between two carbons. So, the molecule has several C-C single bonds.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has a single bond between the central C and the CH. Wait, no, the central C is connected via a double bond to the CH. So, perhaps each C-C bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all the C-C bonds in the molecule.

So, let's see:

- The (CH3)2C=CH- group: the central C is bonded to two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds) and the double bond (so that's a C=C, not C-C).

- Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to the next CH2 group. So, that's a C-C bond.

The CH2 group is connected to another CH(CH3) group. So, that's another C-C bond.

The CH(CH3) is connected to another CH2 group. Another C-C bond.

The CH2 is connected to a CH, which is connected via double bond to the C(CH3)2. So, that's another C-C bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to count all the single C-C bonds.

Each CH3 group has a C connected to three H's. So, each CH3 in the (CH3)2C=CH- group is connected via a C-C bond to the central C. So, two C-C bonds in that group.

Then, the CH is connected to the next CH2, which is a C-C bond.

The CH2 is connected to a CH(CH3), another C-C bond.

The CH(CH3) is connected to another CH2, another C-C bond.

The CH2 is connected to a CH, another C-C bond.

That CH is connected via a double bond (C=C) to the next C, which is part of the C(CH3)2 group.

So, the C(CH3)2 group has the central C connected to two CH3 groups, so two C-C bonds.

So, let's count all the C-C bonds:

In the (CH3)2C=CH- group: 2 C-C bonds (from each CH3 to central C).

Then, the CH connected via a single bond to CH2: 1 C-C.

CH2 to CH(CH3): 1 C-C.

CH(CH3) to CH2: 1 C-C.

CH2 to CH: 1 C-C.

Now, the CH=C(CH3)2 part: the CH is connected to the central C via a double bond (so no C-C bond there), but the C(CH3)2 has two C-C bonds (each CH3 connected to the central C).

So, adding those two, total C-C bonds: 2 (from first group) +1+1+1+1 + 2 (from last group) = 8 C-C bonds.

Wait, let me recount:

First group (CH3)2C=CH-: 2 C-C

Then, each subsequent single bond:

CH-CH2: 1

CH2-CH(CH3): 1

CH(CH3)-CH2:1

CH2-CH: 1

CH- (then double bond to C(CH3)2): so the C in CH is connected to the C in C(CH3)2 via a double bond. So in the C(CH3)2 group, the central C is bonded to two CH3 groups, so two C-C bonds.

So, that's 2 (first group) + 4 (from the four single bonds CH-CH2, CH2-CH(CH3), etc.) + 2 (last group) = 8 C-C bonds.

Wait, but wait, the C in the middle of the molecule (the CH2-CH part) connects to the next CH2 and then to the CH=C group. So, perhaps each of those is a C-C bond.

So, 8 C-C bonds.

Each C-C bond has a bond energy of 200 kJ/mol. So, 8 * 200 = 1600 kJ.

Then, the C=C bonds: there are two of them, each with 300 kJ. So, 2 * 300 = 600 kJ.

Now, the C-H bonds: each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds. Let's count how many CH3 groups are present.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2 group in the first part contributes two CH3 groups. The C=C group at the end has two CH3 groups attached. So, total of 2 (start) + 2 (end) =4 CH3 groups.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds, so 4 * 3 =12 C-H bonds.

Additionally, there are other C-H bonds in the molecule. Let's see:

In the (CH3)2C=CH- group, the CH has one C-H bond. So, that's one more.

Then, in the -CH2- group, each CH2 has two C-H bonds. Let's see how many CH2 groups there are:

Between the first CH and the CH(CH3): one CH2.

Then between CH(CH3) and CH2: another CH2.

Between CH2 and CH=C: another CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should count each CH2 group:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-: that's one CH2.

- Then, CH2-CH(CH3): another CH2.

- CH(CH3)-CH2: another CH2.

- CH2-CH=C: another CH2.

Wait, but perhaps that's four CH2 groups, each with two C-H bonds. So, 4 *2 =8 C-H bonds.

Wait, but wait, the CH(CH3) group has one C-H bond.

And the CH in the CH=C group has one C-H bond.

So, let's sum all the C-H bonds:

CH3 groups: 4 * 3 =12.

CH in (CH3)2C=CH: 1.

CH(CH3): 1.

CH in CH=C: 1.

CH2 groups:

Each CH2 has two C-H bonds. Let me count the number of CH2 groups:

Looking at the formula:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 groups are:

1. After the first CH: CH2-
2. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: CH2-
3. Between CH2 and CH=C: CH2-

So, three CH2 groups, each contributing two C-H bonds: 3 * 2 =6.

Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write the structure as a chain:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 groups are:

1. -CH2- after the first CH.
2. -CH2- between CH(CH3) and the next CH2.
3. -CH2- between the third CH2 and CH=C.

So, three CH2 groups, each with two C-H bonds: 3 *2=6.

Additionally, we have:

The (CH3)2C=CH- group: the CH has one C-H bond.

The CH(CH3) group: it's connected to another CH2, but the CH(CH3) itself has one C-H bond (since it's CH(CH3)).

In the CH=C(CH3)2 group: the CH has one C-H bond.

So, adding all C-H bonds:

CH3 groups: 4 *3 =12.

Single CH's:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 1.
- CH(CH3):1.
- CH in CH=C:1.
Total of 3.

CH2 groups:3 *2=6.

So, total C-H bonds:12 +3 +6=21.

Each C-H bond is 400 kJ/mol. So, 21 *400 =8400 kJ.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Wait, each CH3 has three C-H bonds, correct. Each CH has one, and each CH2 has two.

Now, what about H-H bonds? The molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen. The elements are C (in graphite) and H2 gas. So, when forming the molecule from these elements, we need to break the H-H bonds in H2.

Each H2 molecule has one H-H bond. How many H2 molecules are needed to form the molecule?

The total number of H atoms in the molecule is:

Let's compute the molecular formula. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 3*2 (from two CH3) + 1 (from CH) = 3*2 +1=7 H? Wait, no, each CH3 has 3 H. So, 2 CH3 groups have 6 H. The CH has 1 H, so that's 7 H in that part.

Then, the next CH2 has 2 H.

Then, CH(CH3) has 1 H (since CH3 has 3 H, but the CH is connected to that CH3).

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's molecular formula is C12H18.

Wait, let me check:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 4 C and 7 H: 2*(CH3) (each 3 H) + CH (1 H) → 2*3 +1 =7 H.

Then, the rest of the chain:

CH2 (2 H) → adds 2 H.

CH(CH3) (1 H) → adds 1 H.

CH2 (2 H) → adds 2 H.

CH (1 H) → adds 1 H.

C(CH3)2 → each CH3 has 3 H, so 2 *3 =6 H.

Wait, let's add all:

(CH3)2C=CH- → C:3, H:7.

Then, CH2 → C:1, H:2.

CH(CH3) → C:1, H:1.

CH2 → C:1, H:2.

CH → C:1, H:1.

C(CH3)2 → C:1, H:6.

So, total C: 3+1+1+1+1+1=8? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: 4 C, 7 H.

2. CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

3. CH(CH3): 2 C, 4 H (1 from CH, 3 from CH3).

Wait, no, CH(CH3) is one C (the CH) connected to another C (the CH3). So, the CH(CH3) group has 1 C (from CH) and 1 C (from CH3), making 2 C. H: CH has 1, CH3 has 3 → total 4 H.

4. CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

5. CH: 1 C, 1 H.

6. C(CH3)2: 1 C, 6 H.

Wait, but perhaps I should count each part step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each type of atom:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has two CH3 groups (so 2*(CH3)=6 H) plus a CH (1 H) → 7 H.

The next CH2 is 2 H.

CH(CH3) is 1 H (from CH) plus 3 H from CH3 → 4 H.

Next CH2:2 H.

CH:1 H.

C(CH3)2: 2 CH3 groups → 6 H.

So, total H:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6 =22 H? Wait, but that can't be right because the molecule would have an even number of H's. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C12H18. Let me compute that:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 4 C, 7 H.

Then, CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH(CH3): 2 C, 4 H.

CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

CH: 1 C, 1 H.

C(CH3)2: 1 C, 6 H.

Adding up C:4 +1 +2 +1 +1 +1=10 C. Wait, that can't be right because I thought there were two double bonds (each with two C's), but perhaps I'm not counting correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to count the number of carbons.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is 4 C: two CH3 (each has one C), the central C, and the CH (one C). So, 2 +1 +1=4.

Then, the next CH2: 1 C.

CH(CH3):1 C (since it's a CH connected to a CH3, which itself is one C → wait, no, the CH(CH3) is one C connected to another C (the CH3). So, 2 C's here.

Then, another CH2:1 C.

CH:1 C.

C(CH3)2:1 C.

So total C:4 +1 +2 +1 +1 +1=10 C.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. I thought there were 12 C's. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to count each C:

- (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C.
- CH2 →1 C.
- CH(CH3) →1 C (the CH) +1 C (the CH3) →2 C.
- CH2 →1 C.
- CH →1 C.
- C(CH3)2 →1 C.
Total C:4 +1 +2 +1 +1 +1=10 C.

Hmm, that's 10 C. But I thought the formula had 12 C's. Maybe I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C10H14 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C12H18 as I thought earlier. Let me think differently.

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 CH3, each CH3 is 1 C. So, 2 C's.

The central C in (CH3)2C=CH is another C.

The CH in (CH3)2C=CH is one C. So, that's 4 C's in the first group.

Then, the next CH2 is 1 C.

The next CH(CH3) is 1 C (the CH) plus 1 C (the CH3) →2 C.

The next CH2 is 1 C.

The next CH is 1 C.

The C in CH=C(CH3)2 is another C. And the two CH3 groups attached to that C add 2 C's.

Wait, that would make: 4 (first group) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH) +1 (C in CH=C) +2 (CH3 groups) → that's 4+1+2+1+1+1+2=12 C. Okay, that makes sense.

So, 12 C's in total.

So, the molecular formula is C12H? Let's count the H's.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 2*(3 H from CH3) +1 (H from CH) →7 H.

Then, the next CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (from CH) +3 H (from CH3) →4 H.

Next CH2:2 H.

CH:1 H.

C(CH3)2:2*(3 H) →6 H.

Adding all H's:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6=22 H.

Wait, but that would make the formula C12H22. But that's an odd number of H's. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:

( (CH3)2C=CH- : 2 CH3 (6 H), 1 CH (1 H) →7 H.

Then, CH2: 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (CH) + 3 H (CH3) →4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH:1 H.

C(CH3)2:2 CH3 →6 H.

So, 7 +2=9 → 9+4=13 → 13+2=15 →15+1=16 →16+6=22.

So, 22 H's. So, molecular formula is C12H22.

Wait, but that's an odd number of H's. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, in the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 3*2 +1=7 H.

Then, CH2:2 H.

CH(CH3):1 H (CH) +3 H (CH3) →4 H.

CH2:2 H.

CH:1 H.

C(CH3)2:3*2=6 H.

So, 7 +2=9 → +4 →13 → +2 →15 → +1 →16 → +6 →22. So, yes, 22 H.

So, the molecular formula is C12H22.

But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the H count. Alternatively, perhaps the H count is 18, which is even. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH3 group contributes 3 H, but perhaps some are part of the same group.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without the exact H count, but let me proceed.

So, the number of H atoms is 22, which would mean 11 H2 molecules.

Each H2 molecule has one H-H bond, with bond energy 100 kJ/mol. So, to break all H-H bonds, the energy needed is 11 *100 =1100 kJ.

Wait, but let me think again. If the molecular formula is C12H22, that's 22 H atoms. Each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms. So, number of H2 molecules needed is 22/2 =11.

So, 11 H2 molecules, each with one H-H bond. So, 11 H-H bonds.

So, bond energy for H-H is 100 kJ/mol per bond. So, 11 *100 =1100 kJ.

Now, the bond energies in the molecule are:

C-C:8 bonds ×200 =1600 kJ.

C=C: 2 bonds ×300=600.

C-H:21 bonds ×400=8400 kJ.

Wait, earlier I thought 21 C-H bonds. Let me confirm.

Earlier, I thought 21 C-H bonds. So, 21 ×400 =8400.

Now, the bond energies in the molecule are the sum of all bonds broken to form it. Wait, no, when forming the molecule, the bonds in the elements are broken (H-H and C-C in graphite), and new bonds are formed (C-C, C=C, C-H).

Wait, but the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken in elements) ] - [Σ (bonds formed in compound) ]

Wait, but each bond broken in the elements requires energy (positive), and bonds formed in the compound release energy (negative).

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf° = (energy to break bonds in elements) - (energy released when forming bonds in compound)

Which is equal to sum of bond energies of elements' bonds minus sum of bond energies of the compound's bonds.

Wait, but in terms of the formula, bond energies are positive when broken and negative when formed. So, the total enthalpy change is (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed).

So, bonds broken: H-H and C-C (from graphite).

Bonds formed: C-C, C=C, C-H.

So, the calculation would be:

ΔHf° = [ (number of H-H bonds × bond energy) + (number of C-C bonds in graphite × bond energy) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds × bond energy) + (number of C=C bonds × bond energy) + (number of C-H bonds × bond energy) ]

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the C-C bonds in graphite. Wait, each mole of C atoms comes from breaking C-C bonds in graphite. The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So, for each mole of C atoms, 1000 kJ is needed. So, perhaps the bond energy for C atoms is 1000 kJ/mol. But wait, each C atom in graphite is connected to how many bonds? In graphite, each C is bonded to three others, so perhaps the bond energy per C atom is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, perhaps this is a point of confusion.

Wait, the problem says the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of carbon to produce gaseous atoms. For graphite, each C is bonded to three others. So, the bond energy per C-C bond in graphite is 1000 kJ/mol divided by the number of C-C bonds per mole. Wait, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each C atom in the molecule comes from breaking C-C bonds in graphite, each of which requires 1000 kJ per mole of C.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is as follows:

The enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering all the bonds broken and formed.

Bonds broken:

- H-H bonds: each H2 molecule contributes one H-H bond. There are 11 H2 molecules, so 11 H-H bonds. Each H-H bond has energy 100 kJ/mol. So, total H-H bond energy is 11 *100 =1100 kJ.

- C-C bonds in graphite: each C in the molecule comes from breaking C-C bonds in graphite. How many C-C bonds are broken per mole of C atoms? Each C in graphite has three C-C bonds. So, for each mole of C atoms, three C-C bonds are broken. Wait, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon, which is the energy to break all bonds in a mole of C (graphite) into a mole of C atoms. So, the bond energy for C-C in graphite is 1000 kJ/mol per mole of C atoms.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of C (in graphite) into gaseous C atoms. So, each C atom in the molecule comes from breaking C-C bonds in graphite. The number of C atoms in the molecule is 12 (since it's C12H22). So, 12 moles of C atoms are needed. Each mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ. So, total energy for C is 12 *1000 =12,000 kJ.

Now, bonds formed:

- C-C bonds:8 ×200 =1600 kJ.

- C=C bonds:2 ×300 =600 kJ.

- C-H bonds:21 ×400=8400 kJ.

So, the bonds formed contribute -8400 -1600 -600 = -10600 kJ.

The bonds broken contribute +1100 (H-H) +12,000 (C) = +13,100 kJ.

So, ΔHf° = 13,100 -10,600 =2,500 kJ/mol.

But wait, this doesn't match any of the options. The options are 11200, 67.4, 11.44, 1900.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the bond energies. Maybe the bond energies given are per bond, not per mole. Wait, no, the problem states bond energies in kJ/mol, so per mole of bonds.

Wait, but perhaps the C-C bonds in the molecule are counted as 8, as earlier, but perhaps the H-H bonds are 11, as each H2 molecule has one H-H bond.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation should be:

ΔHf° = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed)

Which is:

(1100 (H-H) + 12,000 (C-C)) - (1600 (C-C) + 600 (C=C) + 8400 (C-H)).

So, 13,100 - (1600+600+8400) = 13,100 -10,600 =2,500 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match that. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

The formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken in elements) ] - [Σ (bonds formed in compound) ]

So, bonds broken:

- H-H bonds: number of H-H bonds in H2 molecules. Since the molecule has 22 H's, that's 11 H2 molecules. Each H2 has one H-H bond. So, 11 *100=1100 kJ.

- C-C bonds in graphite: each mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ (from the given enthalpy of atomization). The molecule has 12 C atoms, so 12 *1000=12,000 kJ.

Bonds formed:

- C-C bonds:8 *200=1600.

- C=C bonds:2 *300=600.

- C-H bonds:21 *400=8400.

So, sum of bonds formed:1600 +600 +8400=10,600.

So, ΔHf°= (1100 +12,000) - 10,600 =13,100 -10,600=2,500 kJ/mol.

But again, the options don't have 2,500. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C12H18, which would have 18 H's, meaning 9 H2 molecules. So, H-H bonds would be 9 *100=900 kJ.

Then, the C atoms would be 12, so 12 *1000=12,000.

Bonds formed would be:

C-C:8 *200=1600.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-H: (18 H's in molecule) → number of C-H bonds? Let me think: Each CH3 has 3, and so on.

Wait, if molecular formula is C12H18, then number of C-H bonds is 2*(number of CH3 groups) + (number of CH groups) + 2*(number of CH2 groups).

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-H bonds is 3*(number of CH3) +1*(number of CH) +2*(number of CH2) +1*(number of CH in CH=C).

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the number of C-H bonds as (2* number of CH3) + (number of CH) + 2*(number of CH2) + (number of CH in CH=C).

Alternatively, perhaps I should count each C-H bond.

In (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds. Let's count how many CH3 groups are present.

- (CH3)2C=CH- has two CH3 groups.

- The C(CH3)2 at the end has two CH3 groups.

So, total of 4 CH3 groups →4 *3=12 C-H bonds.

Then, the CH in (CH3)2C=CH- has 1 C-H.

The CH(CH3) in the middle has 1 C-H.

The CH in CH=C has 1 C-H.

The CH2 groups:

How many CH2 groups are there?

Between (CH3)2C=CH and the next part: one CH2.

Then, another CH2 between CH(CH3) and the next part.

Another CH2 before the CH=C.

So, three CH2 groups → each contributes 2 C-H bonds →3*2=6.

So, C-H bonds:12 (from CH3) +1 (CH in (CH3)2C=CH) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH in CH=C) +6 (from CH2) =21.

Wait, that brings us back to 21 C-H bonds, which implies 21*400=8400 kJ.

But if the molecular formula is C12H22, then I have 22 H's, which would require 11 H2 molecules. So, H-H bonds:11 *100=1100 kJ.

C-C bonds:8 *200=1600.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

So, bonds broken:1100 +12,000=13,100.

Bonds formed:1600 +600 +8400=10,600.

ΔHf°=13,100 -10,600=2,500 kJ/mol.

But the options don't include this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given bond energies are in kJ per bond, not per mole. But the problem states "Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol", which implies per mole of bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds. Let me recount:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: the central C is bonded to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Then, the CH is connected to a CH2 →1 C-C.

The CH2 is connected to CH(CH3) →1 C-C.

The CH(CH3) is connected to CH2 →1 C-C.

The CH2 is connected to CH →1 C-C.

The CH is connected to a C in a C=C bond → but that's a C-C bond? No, the double bond is C=C, so the single bond between CH and C is a C-C bond.

Wait, wait, no. The structure is CH=C(CH3)2. So, the CH is connected via a single bond to the C in the C=C. That's a C-C bond.

So, that's another C-C bond.

In the C(CH3)2 group, two C-C bonds (from CH3 groups).

So, perhaps the C-C bonds are:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 2 C-C.

- CH2-CH:1.

- CH-CH(CH3):1.

- CH(CH3)-CH2:1.

- CH2-CH:1.

- CH- C (in C=C):1.

- C(CH3)2:2.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1+2=9 C-C bonds.

So, earlier count was 8, but perhaps it's 9.

If that's the case, then C-C bonds contribute 9 *200=1800 kJ.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-H:21*400=8400.

So, bonds formed:1800 +600 +8400=10,800.

Bonds broken:1100 (H-H) +12,000 (C)=13,100.

ΔHf°=13,100 -10,800=2,300 kJ/mol.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C12H18, as I thought earlier. Let's proceed with that.

So, 18 H's →9 H2 molecules →9 *100=900 kJ.

C:12 atoms →12 *1000=12,000 kJ.

Bonds formed:

C-C:8 *200=1600.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:21 *400=8400.

Total formed:1600+600+8400=10,600.

So, ΔHf°= (900 +12,000) -10,600=12,900 -10,600=2,300 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the approach is wrong. Another formula for enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But wait, in this case, the reactants are the elements (C and H2), and the product is the compound.

So, the bond energies of reactants:

Each C atom comes from breaking C-C bonds in graphite. Each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol.

But perhaps for each C atom, the bond energy is 1000 kJ. So, 12 C atoms ×1000 =12,000 kJ.

H2 molecules: each has one H-H bond. 9 H2 molecules →9 ×100=900.

So, total bonds broken:12,000 +900=12,900.

Bonds formed:

C-C bonds:8 ×200=1600.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:21 ×400=8400.

Total formed:1600 +600 +8400=10,600.

So, ΔHf°=12,900 -10,600=2,300 kJ/mol.

But again, not matching the options. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option A is 11200 kJ/mol, which is much higher than any of my calculations. Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol, which is way lower. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is per gram. Option D is 1900 kJ/g.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole. Because the options C and D are per gram.

Wait, the question says "Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2." The options have both per mole and per gram.

But the given bond energies are per mole, so the calculation would be per mole.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is different. Let me think: the enthalpy of formation can also be calculated as the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule minus the sum of the bond energies of the elements.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is what I did earlier, but perhaps I made a mistake in the count.

Let me try a different approach: perhaps the molecule has 12 C atoms and 18 H atoms (C12H18).

So, H-H bonds:9 ×100=900.

C atoms:12 ×1000=12,000.

Bonds formed: C-C=8×200=1600; C=C=2×300=600; C-H=18 ×400=7200.

Wait, but wait, how many C-H bonds are in C12H18?

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds.

In C12H18, each CH3 contributes 3. Let me think how many CH3 groups are present.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the (CH3)2 group at the start →2 CH3.

The CH(CH3) group →1 CH3.

The C(CH3)2 at the end →2 CH3.

So, total CH3 groups: 2 +1 +2=5. So, 5 CH3 groups →5 ×3=15 C-H bonds.

Then, the remaining H's are in CH2 and CH groups.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-H bonds is 18 because it's C12H18.

Wait, no. For C12H18, each C can have multiple C-H bonds. So, perhaps the number of C-H bonds is 18.

Wait, but no, each C can have up to four bonds. So, perhaps the total number of C-H bonds is 18.

So, each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ.

So, 18 ×400=7,200.

Then, bonds broken:12,000 (C) +900 (H-H) =12,900.

Bonds formed:8×200=1,600 (C-C) +2×300=600 (C=C) +18×400=7,200 (C-H) → total 1,600 +600=2,200 +7,200=9,400.

So, ΔHf°=12,900 -9,400=3,500 kJ/mol.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × bond energy C-C in graphite) + (n_H2 × bond energy H-H) ] - [ (n_C-C × bond energy C-C) + (n_C=C × bond energy C=C) + (n_C-H × bond energy C-H) ]

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol. But I don't see how to get that number.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, let me count the C-C bonds again.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond between C atoms is a C-C bond.

Let me list all the C-C bonds:

1. Between the central C in (CH3)2C= and each CH3 →2 C-C bonds.

2. Between the CH in (CH3)2C=CH and the next CH2 →1 C-C.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3) →1 C-C.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2 →1 C-C.

5. Between CH2 and CH →1 C-C.

6. Between CH and the central C in C=CH2 →1 C-C.

7. Between that central C and each CH3 in C(CH3)2 →2 C-C.

So, total of 2+1+1+1+1+1+2=9 C-C bonds.

Thus, 9 ×200=1,800 kJ.

C=C bonds:2 ×300=600.

C-H bonds: let's say for C12H18, 18 ×400=7,200.

Bond energies formed:1,800 +600 +7,200=9,600.

Bonds broken:12 ×1000 (C) +9 ×100 (H-H) →12,000 +900=12,900.

ΔHf°=12,900 -9,600=3,300 kJ/mol.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all C-C bonds in a mole of C atoms, which is 1000 kJ/mol. So, each C atom has a bond energy of 1000 kJ/mol. So, 12 C atoms would require 12 ×1000=12,000.

H-H bonds:9 ×100=900.

Bonds formed:

C-C:9 ×200=1,800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:18 ×400=7,200.

Total formed:1,800 +600 +7,200=9,600.

So, ΔHf°=12,000 +900 -9,600=3,300 kJ/mol.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the bond energies given are for the molecule, and the enthalpy of formation is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the molecule is formed from its elements. So, the calculation would be:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of elements] - [sum of bond energies of the molecule].

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, this is getting too frustrating. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 11200 kJ/mol.

But wait, my calculations have not reached that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total bond energies and ignore the C's.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = (number of C × enthalpy of atomization) + (number of H-H × bond energy) – [ (number of C-C × bond energy) + (number of C=C × bond energy) + (number of C-H × bond energy) ]

So, for the molecule:

Number of C atoms:12 →12 ×1000=12,000.

Number of H atoms:22 →11 H2 →11 ×100=1,100.

Total bonds broken:12,000 +1,100=13,100.

Bonds formed:

C-C:9 ×200=1,800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:21 ×400=8,400.

Total bonds formed:1,800 +600 +8,400=10,800.

So, ΔHf°=13,100 –10,800=2,300 kJ/mol.

But this isn't among the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the C-C and C-H bonds in the molecule, and not the C=C bonds. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is ethylene (C2H4), but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer among the options, and perhaps the correct answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a certain number of double bonds that contribute less to the enthalpy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the correct number of C-C bonds is 12. Then, 12 ×200=2,400.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:22 ×400=8,800.

Total bonds formed:2,400 +600 +8,800=11,800.

Bonds broken:12 ×1000=12,000 (C) +11 ×100=1,100 (H) →13,100.

ΔHf°=13,100 –11,800=1,300 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecule's formula being C10H14. Let me try that.

C:10 →10 ×1000=10,000.

H:14 →7 ×100=700.

Bonds formed:

C-C: let's say 10 C's have 10 C-C bonds →10 ×200=2,000.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:14 ×400=5,600.

Total formed:2,000 +600 +5,600=8,200.

ΔHf°=10,000 +700 –8,200=2,500 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the enthalpy of formation is actually the sum of all bond energies in the molecule, minus the sum of the bond energies of the elements. But perhaps I should consider that the bond energies for C in the molecule include the enthalpy of atomization.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule and not the H-H and C-C in graphite. But that doesn't make sense, as the elements are C and H2.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = (number of C ×1000) + (number of H2 ×100) – [ (number of C-C ×200) + (number of C=C ×300) + (number of C-H ×400) ]

So, for C12H22:

Number of C=12 →12×1000=12,000.

Number of H2=11 →11×100=1,100.

Bonds formed:

C-C:9 ×200=1,800.

C=C:2 ×300=600.

C-H:21 ×400=8,400.

Total formed=1,800+600+8,400=10,800.

ΔHf°=12,000 +1,100 –10,800=2,300 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again. Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol. Hmm, 67.4 is approximately 1000 × (12/18), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done on a per-gram basis.

Wait, the molecular weight of C12H22 is (12×12)+(22×1)=144 +22=166 g/mol.

So, if the ΔHf° is 2,500 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 2500 /166 ≈15 kJ/g. Which is close to option C (11.44), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done as:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of elements] – [sum of bond energies of molecule]

So, for the molecule, sum of bond energies:

C-C=9×200=1800.

C=C=2×300=600.

C-H=21×400=8400.

Total:1800+600+8400=10,800.

Sum of bond energies of elements:

C:12 ×1000=12,000.

H:11 ×100=1,100.

Total=13,100.

So, ΔHf°=13,100 –10,800=2,300 kJ/mol.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200 kJ/mol. But I'm not seeing how that would come about.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But I'm not seeing how to reach that number.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C10H16.

So, 10 C's →10 ×1000=10,000.

8 H2 →8 ×100=800.

Bonds formed:

C-C=8×200=1,600.

C=C=2×300=600.

C-H=16 ×400=6,400.

Total formed=1,600+600+6,400=8,600.

ΔHf°=10,000 +800 –8,600=2,200 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and choose option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11200 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds. If the molecule has 36 C-C bonds, which is unlikely, then 36 ×200=7,200. But that's not realistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to not consider the C-C bonds in graphite. Let me try that.

So, bonds broken: H-H =11 ×100=1,100.

Bonds formed: C-C=9×200=1,800; C=C=2×300=600; C-H=21×400=8,400.

So, bonds formed=1,800+600+8,400=10,800.

ΔHf°=1,100 –10,800= -9,700 kJ/mol. Which is negative, but not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But without further insight, I'm stuck.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The enthalpy of formation is typically calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Sum of bond energies of elements]} - \text{[Sum of bond energies of the molecule]}
\]

### Key Data:
- **Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C):** 1000 kJ/mol  
- **Bond energy of H-H:** 100 kJ/mol  
- **Bond energy of C-C:** 200 kJ/mol  
- **Bond energy of C=C:** 300 kJ/mol  
- **Bond energy of C-H:** 400 kJ/mol  

### Step 1: Molecular Formula and Bond Counting
The molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₂₂**. This was determined by counting the number of carbons and hydrogens in the structure:
- **Carbons (C):** 12  
- **Hydrogens (H):** 22  

#### Bonds in the Molecule:
1. **C-C bonds:** 9 (counted by analyzing the structure).  
   - Energy: \( 9 \times 200 = 1800 \, \text{kJ} \).  
2. **C=C bonds:** 2 (double bonds in the structure).  
   - Energy: \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ} \).  
3. **C-H bonds:** 21 (from CH₃, CH, and CH₂ groups).  
   - Energy: \( 21 \times 400 = 8400 \, \text{kJ} \).  

#### Total Bond Energy in the Molecule:
\[
\text{Total bond energy} = 1800 + 600 + 8400 = 10800 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 2: Bonds in the Elements
The elements are carbon (C) and hydrogen (H₂).  
1. **C (graphite):** 12 moles of C atoms are required.  
   - Energy: \( 12 \times 1000 = 12000 \, \text{kJ} \).  
2. **H₂:** 22 hydrogens mean \( 11 \, \text{H}_2 \) molecules.  
   - Energy: \( 11 \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ} \).  

#### Total Bond Energy in Elements:
\[
\text{Total bond energy} = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 3: Enthalpy of Formation
Using the formula:
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Sum of bond energies of elements]} - \text{[Sum of bond energies of the molecule]}.
\]

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = 13100 - 10800 = 2300 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
The calculated enthalpy of formation (\( 2300 \, \text{kJ/mol} \)) does not match any of the provided options. The options are:
- **A) 11200 kJ/mol**  
- **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**  
- **C) 11.44 kJ/g**  
- **D) 1900 kJ/g**  

Given the mismatch, the most plausible explanation is that the correct answer is **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning to reach this value is unclear based on the calculations provided.
