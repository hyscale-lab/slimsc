Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum, denoted as A_y. It’s given that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is written as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so S must be one of them. Let me check the form of S. The standard Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. 

σ_x is [ [0,1], [1,0] ],
σ_y is [ [0,-i], [i,0] ],
σ_z is [ [1,0], [0,-1] ].

Oh, right, so the given S matrix here is exactly σ_y. So S = σ_y.

So, A_y = c * σ_y. Substituting c, that's (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. But before that, the question is about which statement is correct during this calculation.

First, let's find the eigenvalues of A_y. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

So, A_y is (h/(4π)) * σ_y. Let me write σ_y as a matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                    [i, 0]]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

Let me compute the matrix (A_y - λ I). Each element:

Top left: (h/(4π))*0 - λ = -λ
Top right: (h/(4π))*(-i)
Bottom left: (h/(4π))*(i)
Bottom right: (h/(4π))*0 - λ = -λ

So the matrix is:

[ [-λ, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) ) ]

= λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) because i*(-i)= -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, (-i) multiplied by (i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is positive 1.

So the determinant becomes λ² - [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ].

Set this equal to zero: λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait a second. So the eigenvalues are λ = h/(4π) and λ = -h/(4π). But wait, wait—hold on. Oh, because the determinant equation is λ squared minus (h²/(16 π²)) equals zero, so λ = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but hold on. That's the eigenvalues of A_y. But wait, the options are talking about the eigenvalues' real and imaginary parts. So the eigenvalues here are purely real, right? Because h and π are real numbers, so c = h/(4π) is real. So when I multiply that by the eigenvalues of σ_y, since σ_y has eigenvalues ±i (because σ_y is the Pauli
