Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and that it's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is given as h/(4π). So, c is a constant scaling factor here. The matrix S is provided: the first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Isn't that the Pauli Y matrix? Because Pauli matrices are 2x2 and they're used for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons.

So, the operator Ay is c times S, which is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Also, there are four options given, and I need to determine which statement is correct during the calculation.

Let me recall how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

First, let's write out Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then Ay would be [[0, -i*c], [i*c, 0]]. Substituting c as h/(4π), so the matrix becomes [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]].

So the matrix Ay is:
[ [0, -i h/(4π)], 
  [i h/(4π), 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, the characteristic equation is:

|Ay - λ I| = 0

Which becomes:

| [-λ, -i h/(4π) ] |
| [i h/(4π), -λ ] | = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) = λ² - [ (i * (-i) ) (h/(4π))² ) ]

Wait, let's compute that term. ( -i h/(4π) ) * ( i h/(4π) ) = (-i * i) * (h²)/(16 π²). i * i is i² = -1, so (-i * i) is (-(-1)) = 1. So the term is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

Wait, actually, the product is (i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ), but wait, in the determinant calculation, it's ( -i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) which is ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2)/(16 π²). (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = +1. So the determinant becomes λ² - (1 * h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π ) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait no. Wait, sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π ). Because (h/(4π )) squared is h²/(16 π²). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π) * (1/2)? Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the determinant equation is λ² - (h²/(16 π² )) = 0. So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²). So λ = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ? No, wait sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt( (h^2)/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π). So λ is ± h/(4 π). Wait, no. Wait, let's see: h squared over 16 pi squared is (h/(4 pi ))^2, so sqrt is h/(4 pi ). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi ). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4 pi ). Wait, but looking at the options, option B says something about 1/2 and 1, which doesn't match. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2pi h or something, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real, right
