Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography. Hmm, it's about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, and all angles are the same too. Oh right, so in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is probably the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice, so that's 'a' in the lattice parameter.

I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by the Bragg's law formula for crystals. The general formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles?), but wait, I might be mixing things up. Oh right, for a cubic system, it's a simple formula, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ), but wait, no. Wait, that sounds familiar but maybe it's another form. Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a cube that's been deformed, so the Miller indices h, k, l relate to the plane spacing.

Hold on, another approach. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal
