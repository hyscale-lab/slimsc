Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and it's a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question involves mixtures of liquids undergoing certain reactions, leading to some products. Let me try to paraphrase what's happening.

First, there's a mixture X which is equimolar of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has unsaturation, like double or triple bonds. So the liquids in X probably have such functional groups.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The product is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, one part of the reactant becomes a higher oxidation state, and another part becomes a lower one.

Mixture Y is also equimolar of two liquids, and importantly, it doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever is in Y doesn't have the same kind of unsaturation as X. But wait, Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps X has a compound with a certain functional group that breaks down into two different compounds in Y.

Next, both mixtures X and Y undergo hydrogenation with Pt under severe conditions, resulting in a single substance Z. This Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. And Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Oh, and Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. That suggests Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, maybe an alkane, since alkenes and alkynes would react further with hydrogen.

Wait, but the problem states that when X and Y are hydrogenated, only Z is formed. So both X and Y must hydrogenate to the same Z. Interesting.

Also, it's noted that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So any double bonds are not conjugated, meaning they are isolated or maybe in a ring but not in conjugation.

Let me try to structure the information:

1. X: equimolar mixture of two liquids. Decolorizes bromine → unsaturated (double/triple bonds).
2. X → Y via Pt and heat, with disproportionation. Y doesn't decolorize bromine.
3. Y → Z via hydrogenation (Pt, severe conditions). X also → Z.
4. Z is a hydrocarbon, 14.28% H by mass. It's in Y and is a solvent. So Z is probably a common solvent, maybe something like hexane, octane, etc.

Let me calculate Z's molecular formula first. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Let's see:

Assume the formula is CnH2m.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is (2m * 1)/(12n + 2m) ) = 14.28% = 0.1428.

So,

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2m = 0.1428*(12n + 2m)

Let me divide 0.1428 by 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, so 1/7. Let me set this as 1/7 for exactness.

So,

2m = (1/7)(12n + 2m)

Multiply both sides by 7:

14m = 12n + 2m

14m - 2m = 12n → 12m =12n → m =n.

So, m =n. Therefore, the formula is CnH2n.

Wait, but that's the formula for alkenes (alkenes are CnH2n). But wait, Z is a hydrocarbon and doesn't react with hydrogen, so it can't have double bonds. Oh wait, but that's conflicting because if Z is an alkane, it would have 2n+2 hydrogens. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's re-examine the calculation.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, which is 1/7.

So,

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying:

7*(2m) = 12n + 2m → 14m =12n +2m → 12m =12n → m =n.

Hmm, same result. So the formula is CnH2n. So that would imply an alkene, but Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, so that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming
