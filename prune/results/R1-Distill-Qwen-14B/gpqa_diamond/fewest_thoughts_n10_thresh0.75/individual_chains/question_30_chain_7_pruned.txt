Okay, so I've got this question about dyes and the colors they absorb. Hmm. Let me think. The question says that a textile dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and it emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I need to find out which color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember from chemistry that when a molecule absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh right, the complementary color. Because when a substance absorbs a particular color, it doesn't emit that, but the other colors pass through or reflect, and that's what we see as the color of the substance.

So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. That means it's probably emitting the color it doesn't absorb. So the absorbed color is the one with higher energy than the emitted light, but wait, no. Wait, no, because when a molecule absorbs higher energy photons, it gets excited, and then when it drops back, it emits lower energy photons. So the emitted light's energy is lower than the absorbed. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think again. The energy levels: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon would be equal to the difference between the higher and lower states. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one.

So in this case, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed energy would be higher than that. Because the molecule absorbed a higher energy photon, then emitted a lower one.

Next, I need to relate energy to wavelength. The energy E of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength.

Wait, the colors of the visible spectrum go from violet (short wavelength, high energy) to red (long wavelength, low energy). So higher energy photons are violet, blue, green, etc., while lower energy would be towards red.

But wait, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let me calculate the wavelength of that.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The energy E
