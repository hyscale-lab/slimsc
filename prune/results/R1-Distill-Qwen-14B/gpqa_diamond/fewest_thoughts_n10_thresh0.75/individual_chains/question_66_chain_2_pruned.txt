Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework that allows us to add higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model in a systematic way. These operators are classified based on certain symmetries they must respect.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are A to D, each combining different symmetries.

Wait, I need to break this down. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which means the operators are constructed from Lorentz-invariant combinations of fields. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, doesn't SMEFT include operators of different dimensions? Like, the operators have higher dimensions, but do they all respect Poincare? I think that because the Standard Model itself respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an effective theory built upon it, all the SMEFT operators should also respect Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 would both be included.

Wait, but wait another second. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But in SMEFT, the operators are effective, meaning they're valid at certain energy scales
