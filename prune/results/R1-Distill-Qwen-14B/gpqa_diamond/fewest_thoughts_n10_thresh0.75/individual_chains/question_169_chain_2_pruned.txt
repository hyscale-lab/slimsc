Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's, plus two E particles and two V particles. It's given that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is, how does the E energy spectrum compare in this variant?

Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I know about nuclear decay and particle spectra. I think when particles are emitted in a decay, their energy distribution depends on whether they're massive or massless and how they're produced.

In the original case, two E particles and two V particles are emitted. The E's have a continuous spectrum, which suggests that they are massive particles because if they were massless, like photons, their energy would be quantized due to energy and momentum conservation. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in beta decay, beta particles have a continuous spectrum because they're massive. Photons have a discrete spectrum because they're massless and you get quantized energies based on the decay.

Wait, so in the original decay, E and V must be massive particles since their energy is continuous. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy any of the E particles can have.

Now, when they change the decay to emit M instead of two V particles. M is described as an exotic, massless particle. So M is massless, like a photon. So in the variant, 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, but the original had 2V, and now it's M. So how does this affect the E particles' energy spectrum?

In the original decay, since the E particles are massive, their energy would be a continuous spectrum because of the conservation of energy and momentum. The maximum energy Q comes from when all the kinetic energy goes into one E, but because of the other particles, it's not possible for both E's to have maximum energy.

In the variant, M is massless. So when M is emitted, its energy and momentum affect the possible energy
