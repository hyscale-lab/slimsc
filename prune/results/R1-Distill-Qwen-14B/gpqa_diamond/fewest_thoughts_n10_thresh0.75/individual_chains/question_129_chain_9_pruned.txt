Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps involved, and some hints provided. Plus, there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

First, I'll read the reaction steps carefully.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E shows a strong peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, each being some kind of ketone, as they all end with "-one."

Let me start by thinking about each reaction step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B.
HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, HCN would add similarly. But the IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. That's a key point. So A is likely a ketone.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that A could be an ester, but 1750 is more typical for a ketone. Or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehydes tend to have higher wavenumbers, around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but their carbonyl is similar. Hmm, but 1750 is in the range of a ketone. So A is a ketone.

So, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically adds a hydroxyl group and a cyano group across the carbonyl. For example, R2CO → R2C(OH)CN. So compound B would be a secondary alcohol with a cyano group attached.

Wait, but in the next step, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 and Pd are usually for hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group, hydrogenation would reduce the nitrile to an amine, but wait, Pd is more for hydrogenation of triple bonds or maybe nitriles. Alternatively, if B has a double bond, perhaps from the initial structure.

Wait, but B is the product of A and HCN. Let me think again. A is a ketone. Adding HCN to a ketone gives a cyanohydrin, which has a structure where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by OH and CN groups. So, for example, if A is (R)CO(R'), then B would be (R)(R')C(OH)CN.

But then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So what kinds of groups are present in B that could be hydrogenated? The nitrile group (CN) would become an amine under hydrogenation, but wait, H2 and Pd usually hydrogenate nitriles to amines. So B has a CN group, so after hydrogenation, B (with CN) becomes an NH2 group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: hydrogenation of a nitrile (R-C≡N) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically reduce it to an amine (R-CH2-NH2). But sometimes, with different catalysts or conditions, you might get an imine or other
