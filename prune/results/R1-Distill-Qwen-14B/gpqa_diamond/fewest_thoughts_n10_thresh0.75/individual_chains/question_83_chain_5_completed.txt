Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, when we dilute the acetic acid, the concentration will change because we're mixing two volumes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water would double the total volume, right? So the new concentration can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be M1 * V1. But wait, V1 is in cm³, which is 20 mL, 0.02 L. Hmm, M1 is 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / total volume. 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

But wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so in solution, it doesn't completely dissociate. But for the next part, when we titrate with NaOH, the reaction between a weak acid and a strong base will form its conjugate base.

When we titrate, the NaOH will react with acetic acid: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid present. Let me calculate the equivalence point first.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should think about what happens at 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

But wait, perhaps I should first find out the equivalence point details.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles, as calculated earlier.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, moles of NaOH at equivalence point would be same as moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point: moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

Wait, but wait. The initial solution is 40 mL. So when titrating, the volume added is 10 mL at equivalence point. So total solution volume at equivalence is 40 +10=50 mL.

But for the pH at equivalence point, in the case of a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence solution will be a solution of the conjugate base (acetate) in water. Acetate is a weak base, so it will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.

So, to find pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the pH of a 0.001 mol dissolved in 0.05 L (50 mL). Wait, no, wait: the moles of NaOH added is 0.001, and the total volume is 40 mL (diluted solution) + 10 mL NaOH = 50 mL. So the concentration of acetate (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction of acetate is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Since Kb is very small, we can approximate the hydrolysis as:

[OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 -5.486 ≈8.514.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate that square root. 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is sqrt(1.081e-11) which is about 3.288e-6. So pOH is log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → 0.517 + (-6) = -5.483. So pOH is 5.483 → pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52. So if the pH at equivalence point is about 8.52, then let's look at the options.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. So if equivalence point is 8.52, the answer must be option A or D is out because their equivalence is lower.

Wait, but wait. Wait, there's another thing. At equivalence point, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base. So for CH3COO^-, the Kb is Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. So yeah, that's correct.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moles. Let's double-check.

Initially, after dilution: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 mL water gives 40 mL total. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. At equivalence point, all acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So moles of acetate is 0.001 mol, in a total volume of 40 mL (original) + volume of NaOH added. Wait, no: the NaOH is 10 mL, so 40 +10=50 mL.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that part is correct.

Calculating acetate's hydrolysis:

The Kb is correct, and the calculation for [OH^-] is correct, leading to pH around 8.52. So option A's equivalence is 8.52, so possible.

Now, the other part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let's find out how much NaOH is that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. 25% titrated means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So, the reaction consumes 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH and produces 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So, in the solution, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

But we also need to consider the total volume at this point. The initial solution is 40 mL. We've added 25% of the NaOH needed for equivalence. Since equivalence is 10 mL NaOH, 25% is 2.5 mL. So the total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Which is about 4.26. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence it's 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches these numbers. So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, let me cross-verify the calculations more precisely to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me re-calculate the Henderson-Hasselbalch part with exact numbers.

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647. Let me compute that more accurately.

0.005882 ÷ 0.017647 = approximately 0.3332.

Log(0.3332) is log(1/3). Log(1)=0, log(3)=0.4771. So log(1/3) = -0.4771.

So pH is pKa + (-0.4771) = 4.733 -0.4771 = 4.2559, which is approximately 4.26. So that's correct.

What about the equivalence point? Let me recheck the Kb calculation.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85e-5) * 1e-14. Wait, no, wait: 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb =5.405e-10 = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then Kb = x² / (0.02 -x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approximately 3.288e-6 M. [OH^-] = 3.288e-6. pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈5.483. pH =14-5.483=8.517, which is 8.52 when rounded.

So everything checks out. The pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence is 8.52. Option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reaction consumes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid and produces 0.00025 mol of acetate. The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Remaining acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.26.
\]

### pH at Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at equivalence is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate in water is governed by:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Assuming \([\text{OH}^-] = x\), the equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\):

\[
5.405 \times 10^{-10} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

\([\text{OH}^-] = 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
