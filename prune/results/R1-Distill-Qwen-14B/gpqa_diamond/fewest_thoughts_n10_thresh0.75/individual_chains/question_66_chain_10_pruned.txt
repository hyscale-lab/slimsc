Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory framework that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) into a higher-dimensional operator framework. So the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The question asks which of these must be respected by all operators. So, first, I think I need to understand each symmetry and which ones are fundamental in the SMEFT framework.

Wait, wait. I remember that in the Standard Model, the gauge symmetry is SU(2) Ã— U(1), but SMEFT is more about including higher-dimensional operators that preserve the same symmetries as the SM. So SMEFT operators must respect the SM symmetries, right?

Let me go through each option. Lorentz symmetry is a big one. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators should too. Because if they didn't, that would imply the theory isn't relativistic, which is a fundamental assumption of the SM. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry (2)? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. The SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT must too. So operators should be invariant under Poincare. Wait, but sometimes people talk about Lorentz and Poincare separately. Poincare includes translations, which are about shifting the spacetime coordinates. SMEFT is a field theory, so
