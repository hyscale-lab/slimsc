Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model symmetries. But wait, the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, first, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is about the transformations between different inertial frames, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations in space and time. Oh right, Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz symmetry as a part. But wait, in the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare or just Lorentz?

I think that all operators in the SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. Because effective theories have to respect the symmetries of the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT operators should also be. But what about Poincare? Well, Poincare includes translations, so momentum conservation and energy conservation. Since SMEFT is a valid theory at low energies, it should respect all the symmetries that the Standard Model has, including Poincare. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Next, CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation combined with parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. For example, the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix introduces CP violation. So SMEFT includes operators that can have CP violation, right? Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry combining charge, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric because it's Lorentz invariant. Because CPT is a necessary symmetry in any Lorentz invariant theory. Wait, yes, because in quantum field theory, the combined CPT symmetry arises from the requirement of Lorentz invariance. So if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT. So 4 is a symmetry that must be respected.

So putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetry. But wait, I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz. Because Poincare is a larger group. So if the operators must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically respected. But the question asks which must be respected by all operators. So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Is Poincare symmetry actually required? Because SMEFT is a theory that includes all possible operators. Do all the operators in SMEFT have to transform under Poincare symmetry? Or can some of them break Poincare? Hmm,
