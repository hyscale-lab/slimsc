Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane skeleton.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. The 1H NMR shows four signals: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so product 1 likely has a ketone group. Wait, but heating with KOH... Oh right, that's probably a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Since it's dibrominated, maybe it's a double elimination. But wait, with KOH and high heat, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Or maybe more likely, since we're getting a ketone, it could be a pinacol-like elimination.

Wait, but pinacol rearrangement involves diols losing water to form ketones. Hmm. Alternatively, considering the starting material is a dibromide, another possibility is that upon treatment with a strong base like KOH, it undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl. Each Br could be replaced by an -OH group, but wait, that would form a diol. But if you have a strong base, maybe the diol could undergo further elimination.

Wait, wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, each Br could be replaced by an -OH group, but under high heat, perhaps elimination occurs. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is abstracted, leading to a double bond? But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? Or are they in positions that allow for elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. If two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, eliminating two
