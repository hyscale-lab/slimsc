Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get a bit tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. That's a molecular formula for propene, right? Wait, no, wait. Propene is C3H6, yes. But wait, C3H6 could also be propane, but propane is C3H8. Oh no, wait, no, wait. C3H6 is either propene (alkene) or cyclopropane. Since the first reaction is bromination, which typically happens with alkenes. Because bromine adds across double bonds. So I think Compound A is propene (propylene), which is CH2=CHCH3.

So Compound A is propene. Then it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tet (CCl4). Bromination of propene would be an addition reaction. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) when brominated would add Br2 across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,2-dibromopropene? Wait, no, when Br2 adds to an alkene, it adds across the double bond, so each Br attaches to adjacent carbons. So propene would become 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Wait, but wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it becomes BrCH2CHBrCH3? No, wait, addition can be either way, but for propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So structure is CH2Br-CH2-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH-CH3. Adding Br2 would add Br across the double bond, so we get CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, wait. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So addition would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? So yes, 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a
