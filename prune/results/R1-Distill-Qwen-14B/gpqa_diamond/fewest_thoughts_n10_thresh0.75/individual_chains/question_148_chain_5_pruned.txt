Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y, and there are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their reactions, and I need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

First, I'll try to parse each part of the question to figure out what each substance could be.

Starting with A1: It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%, which I think refers to the mole fraction of fluorine in A2. Wait, oF might be oxygen-free or something else? No, wait, maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine in A2? Or perhaps it's the percentage composition. Hmm. Alternatively, oF could stand for the oxidation state. Wait, no, the question says "ɷF=31,96%". Oh, maybe it's the percentage of F by mass. Let me calculate that.

If A2 has fluorine at 31.96% by mass, and knowing fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 g/mol, maybe that can help determine the formula.

Next, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so a strong oxidizing agent would be needed. Fluorine compounds are often strong oxidizing agents. So A1 might be a very strong fluorine compound.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, meaning Y reacts with fluorine to form A3. So A3 is YF_x. It can also react with xenon, so it's another oxidizing agent, perhaps less strong than A1.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. Hmm, when a compound reacts with water and breaks down into two, maybe it's an acid and a gas, or two simple compounds.

So I need to figure out what Y is. Since we're dealing with fluorine compounds, and there are five binary compounds, Y is probably a metal that forms multiple fluorides. Let's think: elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, elements like iron (Fe) can form FeF2 and FeF3. Alternatively, maybe it's something like tin (Sn) which has SnF2 and SnF4, but wait, five binary compounds? Hmm.

Wait, the number of binary compounds with fluorine is five. Let me list possible elements. Maybe Y is polonium (Po)? Because polonium can form PoF2, PoF3, PoF4, PoF5, PoF6? Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead, but lead usually has two main fluorides: PbF2 and PbF4. Hmm, that's only two. Wait, perhaps the element is something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the substances A1 to A5. A1 is a red solid that decomposes to A2 and F2. Red solids with fluorine... One possibility is KClO3 decom
