Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name from the given options. Hmm, the question gives a description of the substituents and their positions relative to each other.

Let me try to visualize the benzene ring. The main functional group is a carboxylic acid, which has the highest priority. In IUPAC naming, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the suffix will be '-oic acid'. The numbering starts from the carboxylic acid group as position 1.

So, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (COOH), a carbaldehyde (CHO), and a cyano group (CN). All three are meta to each other. That means each is separated by two carbons, so their positions are 1, 3, and 5 if the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are meta to each other, so each is at 120 degrees apart. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the other two would be at 3 and 5, but wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. Wait, that's impossible on a benzene ring because three substituents each being meta to each other would require a symmetric arrangement, but benzene is symmetric. Hmm, maybe it's that each pair is meta. So the three substituents are in positions 1, 3, and 5. Or maybe not. Wait, the question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each is meta to the other two. That would require each substituent to be in a position that's meta to the others. So, for benzene, that would be positions 1, 3, and 5. Because each is two positions away from each other.

But wait, maybe I should sketch this out. Let me imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon. Let me assign positions 1 through 6 in a clockwise manner. Position 1 is where the carboxylic acid is attached.

Now
