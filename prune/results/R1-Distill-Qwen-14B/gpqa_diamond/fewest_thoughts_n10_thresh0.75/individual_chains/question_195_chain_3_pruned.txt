Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the setup is there are two planets around a star. The first planet has Earth's radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. The question is about the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii, such that both transit and occultation events happen.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit its star from our point of view, it has to pass directly in front of the star along our line of sight. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of stellar radii) from the center of the star that the planet's path passes. A smaller impact parameter means the planet is closer to the center of the star during transit, which is more likely for closer-in planets.

But wait, the problem is about two planets: the first is Earth-sized, transiting, and has a 3-day period. The second is larger (2.5 Earth radii) and we need to find the maximum period where both transit and occultation occur.

Wait, occultation is when the planet passes behind the star from our perspective. So for both to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that it sometimes passes in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star relative to us.

I think the key here is about orbital periods and orbital distances. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their transits and occultations are aligned in some way.

But wait, I'm trying to recall Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. The formula is (P^2)/(a^3) = (4π²)/(G(M+m)), but since the planets' masses are much smaller than the star, we can approximate it as P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. But since M is the mass of the star, which is similar to the Sun, but wait, here the star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius, but I think the mass depends on whether it's 1.5 solar masses or something else. Wait, no, the problem says the star's radius is
