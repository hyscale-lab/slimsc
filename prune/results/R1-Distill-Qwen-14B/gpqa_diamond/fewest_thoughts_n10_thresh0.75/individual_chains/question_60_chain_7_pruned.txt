Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember something about special relativity from my classes. Let me see.

So, the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their own perspective. The options are given, and I think it's about whether they'll die before getting there or how old they'll be when they arrive.

Wait, the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut." So that's the proper time, right? Because in relativity, proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference—in this case, the astronaut's spaceship.

But wait, time dilation is when time moves slower for the moving object from the perspective of a stationary observer. So from Earth's frame, the spaceship is moving at a high speed, so Earth would see the spaceship's time as dilated, meaning the astronaut ages slower. But the astronaut's own clock would measure less time because of their high speed.

Hmm, but the question is asking about the astronaut's own experienced time. So we need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

Let me recall the formula for time dilation. The time experienced by the traveler (proper time, τ) is related to the time in the Earth frame (t) by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is τ = t / gamma, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, another approach is to calculate the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud and then find out how much time passes for the astronaut. Because from their perspective, they're stationary, and Earth is moving towards them at that high speed.

Wait, but how far is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? Oh, right, it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. But I don't know the exact distance given in the problem. Wait, the problem doesn't give the distance, so maybe I'm supposed to use the given speed and calculate based on distance? Or maybe it's
