Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane. The formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... ), but wait, I'm not sure. Oh right, for a cubic crystal, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but this crystal isn't cubic since the angles are 30 degrees, not 90. So I must consider the rhombohedral structure.

Rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So the unit cell is like a cube but with all angles equal to some value, here 30 degrees each. So the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is a bit different.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distances in crystals is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - 2hk cosθ/(ab) - 2hl cosφ/(ac) - 2kl cosψ/(bc) )) ), but that's for any triclinic crystal. But in rhombohedral, a=b=c and angles α=β=γ, so the formula might simplify.

Alternatively, there's another formula I think is used for rhombohedral systems. Maybe using the reciprocal of the lattice vectors. Or perhaps the formula is based on the Miller indices and the structure factor, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance d can be found using the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)cos(60°) ) / (some expression), but wait, I'm not quite getting it right. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance for the (hkl) plane is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² +
