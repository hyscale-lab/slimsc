Okay, so I have this question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about what the key factor is when converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, especially when using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional methods. The options are A to D. 

I remember that in solving PDEs numerically, finite difference methods are widely used. When dealing with higher dimensions, like 2D or 3D heat equations, the system of equations becomes large. Solving this directly can be computationally intensive, so people look for more efficient methods, especially ones that can be parallelized.

Matrix exponential functions come into play when solving systems where the solution involves terms like e^(At), where A is a matrix. This is common in methods like the method of lines, where you discretize the spatial derivatives and end up with a system of ODEs in time. The solution to these ODEs can be written in terms of matrix exponentials.

But how does this relate to parallel algorithms? Oh right, if you're using a method that can split the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved simultaneously, that's where parallelism comes in. One approach is the parallel alternating direction implicit (ADI) method. ADI is a technique where you split the variables and update them in alternating directions, which can be done in a way that allows for parallel computation.

Wait, the question mentions higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. So the method here probably involves some kind of splitting, which allows the algorithm to be run in parallel. 

Now, matrix exponentials and their approximations—fractional approximation? I'm a bit confused there. Fractional approximations might refer to using a Padé approximation or something similar. Padé approximants are rational function approximations that can provide better accuracy than Taylor series, especially for functions like e^x. So, approximating the matrix exponential with a fractional method could mean using a Padé approximant or another rational approximation.

The key factor in converting a sequential algorithm to parallel—perhaps it's about how the approximation allows the matrix operations to be decomposed. For a sequential algorithm, you might compute each step one after another, but for parallel, you need the operations to be independent or separable. 

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or produce incorrect solutions. Important, but I don't think it's the key factor for parallelism.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate things, but I'm not sure how they directly tie into parallelism.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Wait, fractional approximation here—maybe referring to the denominator and numerator polynomials in a Padé approximant. If the approximant has complex roots, that could affect the stability or the way the matrix is decomposed. But how does that help parallelism?

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions decomposition is a method where you break down a rational function into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of simpler terms, each term might correspond to a part of the matrix that can be handled independently in parallel. That sounds relevant because each part could be exponentiated separately and then combined, allowing for parallel computation.

So, linear partial fraction decomposition would allow you to split the matrix into parts that can be processed in parallel. So the key factor would be the ability to perform such a decomposition, making option D correct.

Another angle: when solving using methods like ADI, you split the problem along different dimensions. For each split, you might end up with a tridiagonal system that can be solved efficiently. If the approximation can be broken down into linear parts, each part can be handled in parallel, hence enabling the parallel algorithm.

So, the correct answer should be D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation.
