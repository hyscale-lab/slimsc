Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with
