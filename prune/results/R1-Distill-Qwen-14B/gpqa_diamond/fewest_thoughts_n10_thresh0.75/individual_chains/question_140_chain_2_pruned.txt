Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is around 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Oh, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So, I need to figure out what X is, and then calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, let's break down the information given.

1. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. When I think of violent reactions, maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid. For example, sodium reacting with water. But wait, sodium is a metal, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogen? Or perhaps something else.

2. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule is probably something like H₂O or CO₂ or maybe O₂, but wait, the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think: each molecule, so each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's consider possible elements or compounds.

Wait, if W is a gas, maybe it's something like CO₂? But wait, in CO₂, each molecule has 1 carbon (6 protons, 6 neutrons typically) and 2 oxygens (each with 8 protons, 8 neutrons usually). So each CO₂ molecule would have 6+8*2 = 22 protons, and 6 + 16 = 22 neutrons. Oh wait, that would mean 22 protons and 22 neutrons per molecule. So that fits the condition of same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Alternatively, O₂ has 16 protons each, so 32 protons in O₂, and 16 neutrons each (so 32 neutrons). So O₂ would fit too. Or maybe CH4? No, because CH4 has 6+4=10 protons and 6 + 4*(9) = 6+36=42 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, but let me think again. When a metal reacts with an acid, like sodium and water, it produces H₂ gas. But H₂ has each molecule with 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each H2 molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't match the same number. Unless it's a different gas.

Alternatively, maybe gas W is something like NH3, but that's a liquid under standard conditions. Or maybe it's CO₂ as I thought before.

Wait, another thought: if the gas is O₂, each molecule has 32 protons (16 from each O atom) and 32 neutrons (each O is 16, so 2 * 16=32). So that would satisfy the same number condition. Alternatively, maybe H2O? Each H2O has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 p, 0 n each
