Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 degrees), a double bond or ring (another 1), maybe another double bond or ring (another 1). Or maybe other combinations. 

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H-NMR (ppm): 
9.72 (t, 1H), 
6.98 (d, 2H), 
6.51 (d, 2H), 
6.27 (bs, 2H), 
3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me think about what each peak could represent. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. A triplet in the high 9 ppm range... that's likely an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but sometimes coupling with adjacent protons can split it. Wait, but this is a triplet. Maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde group, perhaps next to another group that has protons. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic ring with some substituents?

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each 2H. That often suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets for the two substituents in the para positions. So maybe there's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. The 6.98 could be the protons next to an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group or something, but wait, the molecular formula doesn't have a nitro group since N is only 1. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like -OCH2 or something else.

Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one N, one O. Let's think about the structure. Maybe a phenyl group attached to something else. The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Because OCH2 protons usually show up around 3.5-4 ppm as a singlet or doublet, depending on neighboring protons.

The 6.27 is a broad singlet of 2H. Broad signals are often from protons that are exchanging, like -OH groups, but 2H... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene's protons, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because the other peaks are doublets which fit better for a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the 6.27 is a vinyl group, like a CH2=CH- structure? Or perhaps a conjugated system.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule is something like a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's imagine a benzene ring with an substituent that includes an aldehyde group and another substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me think about the possible structure. If it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a side chain. Let's say the benzene is C6H4 (since each substitution reduces H by 1 each). So the side chain would be C2H5NO. Because 6 (from benzene) + 2 (side chain) = 8. Wait, but the side chain is C2H5NO? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the side chain is longer. Let me think. Another approach: the molecular formula with C8H9NO. The benzene is C6H5. Then the substituent is C2H4NO. Let's see: C6H5-CH2-CHO? That would be C8H7O, but that doesn't include N. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has an amine group. Wait, the molecular formula has one N. So perhaps an oxygen and a nitrogen in the structure. Maybe a nitro group? But that's O2N-. But the formula includes only O. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So one O and one N. So the substituent must have both O and N.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzamide structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a substituted benzaldehyde with an amino group attached elsewhere.

Wait,
