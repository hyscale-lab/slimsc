Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it's reacted through three steps with specific reagents. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm, let me recall what these signals might correspond to.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. High upfield shifts like that are usually aldehydic protons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, so maybe that's an aldehyde proton. But wait, the assignment says triplet, which suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehydes typically are deshielded and appear as singlets because there's no neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton or something else.

Wait, let me think again. An aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's only attached to one carbon which has no protons. So maybe this peak isn't an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton like an enol tautomer or something else. Or maybe a phenolic OH? But phenol OHs are usually broader and maybe around 5 ppm if exchange broadened, but sometimes can be downfield. Wait, but 9.72 is really high for a phenol. Maybe it's a formyl group, but then why is it a triplet?

Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. Wait, like an enone. The triplet could be the vinylic proton adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's think about that. For example, in a conjugated system like CH2=CH-C=O, the CH2 protons would be split by the adjacent double bonds. Wait, but in that case, maybe the protons on the double bond would be around 6-7 ppm. Hmm, the 9.72 is way higher than that.

Wait, perhaps it's a nitro group? No, nitro protons are usually in the 7-8 ppm range, but I don't think nitro groups have protons. Wait wait, the compound has a nitrogen in the formula. So maybe it's an amide or something else, but the NMR doesn't show a peak in the amide region. Alternatively, it's an aromatic amine or an aniline derivative.

Wait, let's look at the other signals. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So perhaps two para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, if each is a pair of H in a para-substituted benzene, each as a doublet. So maybe something like two phenyl groups attached to another structure.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps an exchange with a hydroxyl group or an enol form. Alternatively, maybe it's something like an enol with exchange broadening. Wait, but if it's a non-aromatic proton, maybe adjacent to an electronegative group or something. Or maybe it's a diol or something with adjacent OH groups.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range for protons adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an ester or an alkoxy group. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe it's a CH2-O group, where the two protons are next to an oxygen and each is next to another CH2 group.

Wait, putting it all together. Let's think about possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, one ring (1), one double bond (another), and maybe another ring or double bond, etc. Or maybe a benzene ring (3 for the ring and two double bonds) plus a carbonyl group.

Wait, the NMR has two sets of aromatic protons, so maybe a biphenyl structure. Let's think of a structure where there are two phenyl groups attached to another part of the molecule. For example, a para-substituted benzene attached to a central chain.

The aldehyde peak is a triplet, which is confusing. Maybe it's a conjugated system where the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group. Wait, but aldehydes don't have neighboring protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated dienone system. Hmm. Or perhaps the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat.

NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization. So this is likely a reaction where an aromatic amine is converted to a diazonium salt. Then, when heated with water, it undergoes hydrolysis. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions depending on conditions. Alternatively, under aqueous KOH and heat, perhaps it's a elimination or some kind of condensation.

Wait, but the initial compound has an N in the formula. Let's see, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen.

So the structure must have an N somewhere. Since the reagents are diazotization, the initial compound probably has an aromatic amine group. So perhaps it's an aniline derivative.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 9.72, which I'm still not sure about. Let me think: if the compound has an aniline group (
