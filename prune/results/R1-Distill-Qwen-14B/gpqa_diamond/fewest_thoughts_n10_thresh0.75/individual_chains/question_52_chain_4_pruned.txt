Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. So, the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So, we're to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, so the ratio is decreasing when spots are present. That means when the star is cooler (because of the spots), the ratio is lower. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = let's see ... maybe exponential?

Wait, I think this involves the Boltzmann equation because it's about the distribution of atoms in different energy levels. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the two levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio R = n2/n1. So R is proportional to exp( - ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, but wait. The transition wavelength is given as 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range,
