Alright, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound is made up of five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. They've produced several mutants and sequenced the target gene. The question is which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound.

Looking at the provided sequences, the intact gene and each mutant have slight variations in the first exon area. I need to determine which mutation is likely to disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

First, I should remember that the exons are the coding regions of the gene. So any mutation in the exons could potentially change the protein product. For a mutation to eliminate the compound, it probably disrupts the gene's function, maybe by creating a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or by altering the protein structure so it doesn't function (a missense mutation in a critical region).

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing to the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCT... In mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCT... Let me see the difference.

Let me write the original and mutant sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT GGC …
Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are.

Wait, perhaps I should count the positions. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see where the mutations are by looking for differences.

Looking at the beginning:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCT...

So, the original starts with ATGTTTCTC, and the mutant has ATGTTCTAC. Let's compare:

Original: positions 1-10: ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: positions 1-10: ATG TTC TAC GCT...

So, comparing nucleotides:

Position 4: Original is T, mutant is T (same). Wait, maybe I should check each nucleotide.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write out the first few nucleotides:

Intact Gene: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…-3'
Mutant 1: 5'-ATGTTCTAC
