Alright, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the scenario is that there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate the compound, so they're using EMS mutagenesis. They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found some changes in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation will probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I'm thinking that the compound is probably a product of this gene, so if the gene is mutated, the compound's synthesis might be affected.

Looking at the options, the intact gene is given, and each mutant has a sequence change. I need to compare each mutant's sequence to the intact one to see what kind of mutation occurred and where.

Let me write down the sequences for clarity.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Hmm, comparing to the intact, let's look at the first part. The intact starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT... So, in Mutant 1, the first part is ATGTTCTACGCT...

Wait, let's look at the first few nucleotides. Intact: ATGTTTCTC, Mutant1: ATGTTCTAC. So, perhaps a substitution here. Let me see the exact changes.

Wait, perhaps I should line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG ...

Wait, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compare each position.

Wait, looking at the two sequences:

Intact: 5' ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

Mutant1: 5' ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3'

So, let me go through each part.

The first part, looking at the first few nucleotides.

Intact: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

Wait, so let me compare each position:

Looking at the first 12 nucleotides:

Intact: positions 1-12: ATGTTTCTC

Mutant1: positions 1-12: ATGTTCTAC

Wait, that's not matching. Let's see:

Wait, maybe I should count the letters. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of where the mutations are.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach: each mutation
