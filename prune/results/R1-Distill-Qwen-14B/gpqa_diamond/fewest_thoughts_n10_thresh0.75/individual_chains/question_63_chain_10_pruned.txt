Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Let me see what I remember.

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So that means it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy levels. Wait, the question says it's in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the fundamental state for a diatomic molecule would be the ground state, so vibrationally it's in the first state, and rotationally it's the lowest as well. But the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think that means the next higher state, but the minimal energy increase. So that could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, but which one requires less energy?

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. The energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. B is the rotational constant. For the rigid rotor, B is (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, the problem gives the bond length R as 2 angstroms. So I can calculate I as μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Wait, but wait, the problem also gives the angular frequency ω for vibration as 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (n + ½) ħ ω, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

So the molecule is currently in its fundamental state, which is the lowest state. So both J and n are at their lowest values. Wait, J can be 0, which is the lowest rotational state. And n is 0 for the vibrational state. So the molecule is in the state (J=0, n=0).

Now, it absorbs a photon and moves to the next state with the lowest energy. I think the next lowest state would be either J=1 (rotation) or n=1 (vibration), whichever requires less energy. So I need to calculate the energy difference for both transitions and see which is smaller.

Wait, but the problem says it's a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, which combines both. So perhaps the photon must supply enough energy to move to a higher state, but the minimal possible. So the minimal energy change would come from the lowest possible transition.

So let me compute the energies for the possible transitions.

First, compute the rotational energy transition. The rotation starts at J=0. The next state is J=1. The energy difference ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B*(1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)) = B*(2 - 0) = 2B.

What's B? B is (ħ²)/(2I), and I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Calculating μ: The reduced mass is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert this into kilograms. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that. 1.818 *1.6605 is about 3.015. So μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. Since 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, R is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3
