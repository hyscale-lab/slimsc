Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, but wait, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, I think the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond vibrations as well. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state and moving to the next lowest energy state. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I'm a bit confused about whether this transition is purely vibrational or rotational or a combination.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, so maybe the molecule can change both rotational and vibrational states when it absorbs a photon. But the problem is about the momentum of the photon, so I need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next state, then relate that to the photon's energy and momentum.

The given data: masses of X and Y are 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. Bond length R is 2 angstroms. Angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

First, I think the fundamental state in this model is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). But wait, if the molecule
