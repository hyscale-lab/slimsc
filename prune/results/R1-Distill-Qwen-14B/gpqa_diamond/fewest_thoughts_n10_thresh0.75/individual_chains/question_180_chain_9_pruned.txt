Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Let me try to understand what's going on. Hmm, the problem says there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each has a charge of 2e. Oh, and their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed right at P. The question is asking about the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is the right answer.

Wait, so the system's potential energy depends on the configuration of the charges, right? Since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2 meters away. But I'm trying to find the minimum energy. Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy is related to the work done to bring charges from infinity to their positions. But wait, since all charges are already in place except the one at P, maybe I need to calculate the potential energy due to each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait a second. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the other 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P. So, each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge (which is at P). So, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges would contribute to the total potential energy of the system.

But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Oh, right! Because each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but how far are they from each other? Wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So I think they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters. But wait, the problem doesn't specify their exact arrangement. Hmm, but the potential energy between any two charges depends on the distance between them.

Wait, but the 12 charges are identical and constrained at 2m from P. So their mutual distances could vary, but in order to find the minimum energy, perhaps the charges should be arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But I'm a bit confused because for a system of charges, the potential energy
