Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I need to determine the major outcome from the given options. Hmm, I remember that enols can undergo various reactions, especially when they're treated with halogens like bromine.

Wait, what's an enol again? Oh right, enols are compounds that have both an alcohol group and a double bond adjacent to it. They're often formed by keto-enol tautomerism. But in this case, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the structure must be a cyclopentane ring with a double bond at position 1, and two methyl groups on the same carbon at position 4, right?

So the structure is cyclopentene (five-membered ring with a double bond) substituted with two methyl groups on the same carbon, which is adjacent to the double bond. Wait, no. Wait, cyclopent-1-enolâ€”so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl group is on carbon 1 as well? Wait, no, wait. Enol structure is an alkene adjacent to an alcohol. So for cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl is on carbon 1. But wait, no, the numbering could be different. Let me think again
