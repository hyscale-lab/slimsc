Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics are operators that give the energy of the system. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian correspond to the possible energy levels the system can have.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Let me think about what each part means. σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are three 2x2 matrices (σx, σy, σz), each with specific forms. The dot product with n, which is a unit vector, would be like a combination of these matrices scaled by the components of n.

Wait, so σ · n would be σx * nx + σy * ny + σz * nz, right? Because the dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their components. Since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the characteristic equation, which involves the trace and determinant. Alternatively, for a matrix that's a sum of Pauli matrices multiplied by some coefficients, maybe there's a shortcut.

I think the Pauli matrices have the property that each σ_i squared is the identity matrix. So σx² = σy² = σz² = I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. Hmm, but what about the square of the sum σ · n?

Wait, let's compute (σ · n) squared. (σ · n)^2 = (σx nx + σy ny + σz nz)^2. When you square this, you'll have cross terms like σxσy, σxσz, etc. But each product of different Pauli matrices, like σi σj, is equal to i ε_ijk σk, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. But when you square σ · n, the cross terms might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the expectation value or properties of the matrix.

Another approach: Any 2x2 Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized, and its eigenvalues are real. Since H is a scalar multiple (ε) of a sum of Pauli matrices, which are Hermitian, H itself is Hermitian. So it should have real eigenvalues.

Wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, I think
