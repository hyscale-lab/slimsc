Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the problem says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait. So, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key thing is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it's memoryless. Oh! So if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability for the next 150 minutes should be treated as starting fresh, right?

But wait, the given probability is 32% for 100 minutes. I think I need to find the decay constant first. Let me recall the formula: the probability P of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So, 32% is 0.32. So,

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Let me solve for λ. Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566.

So, λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the next part. We've already waited 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes should be calculated as if we just started. So, total time here is 150 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait, the 50 minutes have already passed. So the remaining time after that is 150. No, wait, no— no, the 50 minutes have already passed, and the next 150 is the period we're looking at. So the total time since the start is 200 minutes, but that's not how the decay works. Because the decay probability is for the next 150 minutes, regardless
