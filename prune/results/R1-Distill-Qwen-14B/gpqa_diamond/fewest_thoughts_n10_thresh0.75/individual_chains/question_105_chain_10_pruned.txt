Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun with radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is spotty, when it rotates, the brightness variation looks like it could be an exoplanet. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted star.

The options are A to D, all fractions. So I need to calculate the relative radius of the planet compared to the star (Rpl/Rstar).

Hmm, I remember that the brightness dip when a planet transits a star is calculated based on the area blocked. The formula is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the radius squared. But wait, this is about the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by spots, not a planet transit.

Wait, the problem says that if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude. So I think I need to compute the amplitude caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

First, let's think about the star without spots. If it were unspotted, the brightness variation would be due to something else, but in this case, we're comparing the spotted star's variation to a planet's transit. So, the key is to find the equivalent depth caused by the spots and equate it to the planet's effect.

The star has a radius Rstar, same as the Sun. The spots cover a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered? But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. Does that mean 20% of the total surface area is covered, or 20% of the hemisphere?

Wait, the filling factor is usually the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So if the entire surface were covered, the filling factor would be 1. But in this case, only one hemisphere is covered, and within that hemisphere, 20% of its area is covered by spots. So the total area covered is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1, which is 10% of the total surface area.

Wait no, wait. Let's think again. The star's surface is a sphere, so the area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area covered is 0.4πR². So the filling factor for the entire star would be (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) ) = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered in spots.

But the problem says
