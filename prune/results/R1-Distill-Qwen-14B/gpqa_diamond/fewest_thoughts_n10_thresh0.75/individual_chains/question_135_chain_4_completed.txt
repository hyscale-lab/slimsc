Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure what this Lagrangian represents. Oh right, that's the interaction term between the boson X and some fermions. So X is interacting with fermions ψ_f.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions it can decay into, considering their masses. Because for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than the boson's mass. So each fermion's mass must be less than half of 6 GeV. Oh wait, because each fermion would have a mass m, so 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV.

What are the masses of the known fermions? Let me recall:

- Up quark (u): like 2 MeV, so way below 3 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, around 4-5 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV, so also much less.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV. Hmm, 1.5 is less than 3, so that's okay.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 3 GeV. So two b quarks would sum to 9 GeV, which is way over 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. The fermions are ψ_f, which are the same as the quarks? So each fermion has mass m. So for decay X → f fbar, the mass condition is 2m < M_X. So M_X is 6 GeV, so each m must be less than 3 GeV.

So looking at the quarks:

u, d, s, c: their masses are all below 3 GeV. So their pairs are allowed. But b quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar because 4.5 *2 =9>6.

What about the leptons? The charged leptons are e, mu, tau, and their masses:

e: about 0.5 MeV, negligible.
mu: ~105 MeV.
tau: ~1.78 GeV.

So for tau: 1.78 GeV. 2 * 1.78 is about 3.56 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

Wait, wait. Wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV. 1.78 *2 is 3.56, which is less than 6. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Other leptons: e and mu. Their masses are way below 3 GeV, so they can also decay into e+ e- and mu+ mu-.

What about the top quark? Oh wait, top is super heavy, around 173 GeV. So way beyond 3 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks.

So for the fermions allowed, we have:

u, d, s, c for quarks. And e, mu, tau for leptons.

Wait, but the options given are:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, I thought b is too heavy. So option A includes b, which can't be allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So B includes c, which is allowed since 1.5 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So that's okay. But wait, does that mean X can decay into c cbar?

Yes, because 2*1.5=3 <6.

But wait, the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, that might imply which fermions are involved. Because the interaction is with ψ_f, which are perhaps the charged fermions. Wait, but the term is with X(y), so X is a scalar (maybe) interacting with the fermions.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is Yukawa-like. The term is ψ_f^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems a bit off for a Yukawa coupling. Maybe I'm getting confused. The exact form might not matter for the decay possibilities, because the question is about the kinematics, not the interaction strength.

So going back, I think the possible decay products are all the fermions whose mass is less than 3 GeV. So quarks u, d, s, c; and leptons e, mu, tau.

So looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But wait, what about the top quark? But top is way too heavy.

Option C includes t tbar, which is impossible. So C is out.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct allowed decays are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options, option B includes them all except for the b quark.

Wait, no, option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-; mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

Wait, but wait, what about the bottom quark's mass? If X can't decay into b, but the options have some including it.

So the correct option is B or D. Wait, option D includes b, which is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9>6 GeV. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option B.

Wait, but wait: Let me double-check the quark masses. Let me list them:

Up quark (u): ≈ 2 MeV.

Down quark (d): ≈ 4-5 MeV.

Strange quark (s): ≈ 100 MeV.

Charm quark (c): ≈ 1.5 GeV.

Bottom quark (b): ≈ 4.5 GeV.

Top quark (t): ≈ 173 GeV.

So all quarks except for b and t are below 3 GeV. So X can decay into:

u, d, s, c, and their anti-particles.

So in the options, which include these?

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option A includes b, which isn't allowed.

So the correct allowed decays are c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but wait, the given Lagrangian is in terms of ψ_f. Does ψ_f include all possible fermions, or only specific ones? The Lagrangian might influence which fermions are coupled.

Hmm, the term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). So ψ_f must be the fermion fields. So the interaction is between X and all the fermions ψ_f. So any fermion that can couple to X is allowed.

But the mass is 6 GeV, which allows for X to decay into any pair of fermions where each is less than 3 GeV.

So the only thing is, looking at the options, B is the only one that includes all the allowed fermions except for the b quark.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the boson's mass, i.e., \( 2m_f < M_X \). Here, \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded, as \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the allowed fermions are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \( \mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y)(\upsilon + X(y))\psi_f(y) \), indicates that \( X \) interacts with all fermions \( \psi_f \), so the kinematic constraints are the only factor limiting the decay modes.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\!e^- \), all of which satisfy \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay modes of \( X \).

Answer: B
