Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times our Sun, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. They've used the Equivalent Width (EW) method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) to determine elemental abundances.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

The question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, ratio = n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

Hmm. I think I need to compute [Si/H] for each star, then find the ratio using those values.

First, let's think about Star_1. 

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So, the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. So, n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,☉ / n_H,☉.

But wait, the Sun's n_Fe/nH is 1e-4.5. So, Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → same as Sun. So, n_Fe,1 = n_Fe,☉ * (n_H,1 / n_H,☉ )

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe,☉ /n_H,☉ )

So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe,1/n_H,1) = log(n_Fe,☉/n_H,☉) → so n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,☉ / n_H,☉. So, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,☉ / n_H,☉) *n_H,1.

But for the ratio, maybe it's better to think in terms of [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X,☉/n_H,☉ )

But I'm trying to find [Si/H] for each star.

Given that [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si,☉/n_Fe,☉ ) = 0.3.

Wait, no. The definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X,☉/n_Y,☉ )

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 ) = log(n_Si,☉ / n_Fe,☉ ) + 0.3

Similarly, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe,1 /n_H,1) - log(n_Fe,☉/n_H,
