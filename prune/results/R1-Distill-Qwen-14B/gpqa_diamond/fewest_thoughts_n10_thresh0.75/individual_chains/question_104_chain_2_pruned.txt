Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves due to the planet's gravity, causing a shift in the spectral lines.

The question says two stars with the same mass as the Sun and each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shift in their spectral lines is given. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so the key here is the relation between the Doppler shift and the orbital period. I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, among other things.

The RV method measures the velocity of the star's reflex motion. The formula I recall is something like V = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(½) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

But wait, since the planet masses are similar to Neptune's and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much smaller than M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term is 1.

So V ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But since both stars are identical (same mass) and the planets have similar masses, M_p is the same for both planets. So the velocity V is proportional to 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, but the shift in the spectral line is directly proportional to the velocity. So if V1 is the velocity for Planet #1 and V2 for Planet #2, then V1 = k / P1^(1/3), and V2 = k / P2^(1/3), where k is a constant (because M_p and M_star are same for both).

So, V1 / V2 = (P
