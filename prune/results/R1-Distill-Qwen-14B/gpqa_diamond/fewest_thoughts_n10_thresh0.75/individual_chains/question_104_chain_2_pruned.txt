Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines corresponds to the star's velocity towards or away from us. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data here are the shifts in their spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I need to find the ratio of their orbital periods. So, P2/P1 equals what?

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. The larger the velocity, the larger the shift. So K is proportional to the shift. The formula for K involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. 

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 sin i) / (P)^(1/3) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can approximate that as (M_*)^(1/3). So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_*) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 AU)) ) Wait, no, wait. Maybe the formula is K = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relation between K, the semi-amplitude, and the orbital period. I think the formula is K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / P)^(1/3). Because higher K means higher velocity, which would cause a larger
