Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait. Oh, actually, the state vector is a column matrix, so it's [-1; 2; 1]. Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that. So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 1+4+1=6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That might complicate things, but maybe in the problem they're okay with it, or perhaps the probabilities will adjust accordingly.

The question is about measuring P and then Q. We need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, the operators P and Q are given. So P is a 3x3 matrix, and Q is another 3x3 matrix. Let me write down the matrices.

First, matrix P:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

And matrix Q is diagonal:
First row: 1, 0, 0.
Second row: 0, 0, 0.
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

So, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is calculated based on the eigenvectors.

First, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when you measure P, the result must be one of its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, but wait. The problem is sequential measurements: first measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1. So, the first measurement of P gives 0, which is one of its eigenvalues. Then the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.
