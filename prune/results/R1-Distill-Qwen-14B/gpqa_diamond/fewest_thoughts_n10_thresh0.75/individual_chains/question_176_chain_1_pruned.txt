Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, no, that's probably a vector with three components: -1, 2, 1. So it's a 3-dimensional vector. Got it.

Then there are two observables, P and Q, represented by their respective matrices. The operator P has a matrix where the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The operator Q has a matrix with first row (1, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). 

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q, in that order (measure P first, then Q).

Wait, no, wait: the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P... what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So the order is P first, then Q. So it's the probability of measuring P=0 first, then after that, measuring Q=-1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, we measure P, which has eigenvalues, and depending on which eigenvalue is measured, the state collapses. Then, the state after P is measured is an eigenstate of P, so when we measure Q next, it's done on that new state.

But wait, the problem is about the combined probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So first, we need to find the probabilities for each measurement, but since the second measurement is dependent on the first, we have to consider the state after the first measurement.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. So the overall process is: initial state |Ïˆ>, measure P, get 0, so the state becomes the corresponding eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0.
