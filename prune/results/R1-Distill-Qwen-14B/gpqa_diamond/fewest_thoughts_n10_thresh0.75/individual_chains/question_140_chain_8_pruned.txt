Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack all the information given.

The question starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and releases B when heated. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, that's just above the freezing point of water, so maybe B is something that freezes just a bit below that? Or maybe it's another substance that's related to water.

Next, the product of X reacting with a certain keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Substances that react with keto acids... Wait, maybe X is a base? Because acids and bases react. Also, the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is something like a metal, and when it reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), it produces a salt and water. For example, NaOH reacting with acetic acid would give sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate has O from the acid and the base.

The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. One common reagent is NaOH, which is used in many reactions, like saponification or in nucleophilic substitutions. Another possibility might be something like KOH or maybe even something else, but sodium hydroxide is a strong base and a common reagent.

But wait, the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is an element that has a common isotope and a heavier one. For example, chlorine has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is something like NaCl, but wait, NaCl is a salt, not a base. Hmm, maybe X is something else. Wait, if X is a base, maybe it's an alkali metal hydroxide. Let's think: sodium hydroxide is NaOH. Sodium has isotopes, but the heavier ones are rare. Alternatively, maybe X is an alkali metal, but that's unlikely because alkali metals react violently with water, not necessarily with acids. Or perhaps X is something like potassium?

Wait, but the reaction is with liquid Y. What's liquid Y? It could be water, perhaps. If X is a metal, like sodium, reacting with water would produce hydrogen gas, but the problem says gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the gas's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas is H2; each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So that's not equal. Helium has a noble gas, but He is monoatomic. Next, maybe CO2? No, because that's a molecule with two oxygen atoms. Or, perhaps something like NH3? No, that's a gas but doesn't fit the neutron and proton count.

Wait, looking for a molecule where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think: H2O has H (1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 or 9 neutrons). So each H doesn't match O. Maybe CO? That's a diatomic molecule, but each
