Okay, so I have this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for things like exoplanet research and stellar spectroscopy. The key here is to find out which of the listed stars have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel after a 1-hour exposure.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I need to calculate or estimate the S/N for each star. I remember that S/N in astronomy depends on factors like the star's brightness, the telescope's collecting area, exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. Let me jot down what I know.

ESPRESSO's specifications: I think it has a high spectral resolution, but what about its sensitivity? The S/N depends on the number of photons collected. The formula I vaguely recall is S/N proportional to (flux * exposure time * telescope area) divided by (noise factors like readout noise and background, but maybe that's too detailed for this).

Each star's brightness can be determined by their apparent magnitude. Absolute magnitude is given for some stars, so I'll need to convert those to apparent magnitude using the distance. Oh wait, the formula for that is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. Right, because the formula is m - M = 5 log10(d) - 5, so m = M +5(log10(d) -1).

Let me list the stars:

a) Canopus: I know it's a bright star. Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation Carina. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7. So that's very bright.

b) Polaris: The North Star. I think it's around magnitude 2, but maybe a bit dimmer than Canopus. I think it's around 1.8 to 2.0, but I'm not exactly sure. Either way, it's brighter than the Sun, which is about 5, so Polaris is easily visible.

c) Star with V=15 mag, 10 pc away. Since absolute magnitude (M) is 15, let's compute its apparent magnitude. m = 15 +5 log10(10) -5 = 15 +5(1) -5 = 15. So m=15. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, the formula is m = M +5*(log10(d) -1). So for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1, so m =15 +5*(1-1)=15. So apparent magnitude is 15. That's really faint.

d) Same M=15, but at 200 pc. Let's compute m. m=15 +5*(log10(200) -1). Log10(200) is log10(2*10^2) = 2.3010 (since log(2)=0.
