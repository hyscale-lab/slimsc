Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with a certain index of refraction, n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think it's related to how light's speed is perceived when the medium (like glass) is moving. I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed in the medium when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh right, this might involve the concept of relative velocity. So the glass is moving at velocity v. The light's speed in the medium is c/n, but from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how does that change?

Wait, no, the glass is moving, so the lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving. So I need to find the speed of the light beam as observed from the lab.

In special relativity, velocities add up using the velocity addition formula. But wait, this is a scenario involving a medium moving through the lab. But wait, isn't the index of refraction related to the medium's properties, which are at rest in their own frame
