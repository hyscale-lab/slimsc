Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Hmm, I remember titration involves neutralizing a solution with a base, and acetic acid is a weak acid, so it's going to react with NaOH, a strong base.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I should calculate the new concentration after dilution because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M times 0.02 liters. That's 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, or 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles divided by new volume. 0.001 / 0.04 equals 0.025 M. Got that down for the diluted solution.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Okay, so I need to find two pH values.

Let me think about the 25% titration first. 25% of what? Oh, I think it means 25% of the titration needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to figure out the volume of NaOH needed for the equivalence point first.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH will equal the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. Since NaOH's concentration is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / Molarity, which is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, that's 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, that's 25% titration.

Now, for the 25% point, which is before the equivalence point. So the solution is a buffer solution because some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate ion.

I should calculate the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion at this point. Let's see, when you add NaOH to acetic acid, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O

So moles of CH3COOH originally after dilution: 0.
