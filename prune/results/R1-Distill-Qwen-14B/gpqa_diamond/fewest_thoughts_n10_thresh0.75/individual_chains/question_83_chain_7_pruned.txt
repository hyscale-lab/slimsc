Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base. So, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, first things first. What's the initial concentration after dilution? Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. Then adding 20 cm³ water makes the total volume 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's compute that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So I need to find two pH points: at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let's tackle the equivalence point first. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate moles of acetic acid initially. Volume is 40 cm³ (after dilution), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V (in liters). Oh wait, 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O, the moles of NaOH needed would also be 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc → 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). So the solution is a buffer of acetate ions in water. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic. So the pH should be above 7.

To find the pH at equivalence, I can calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then use the Kb expression. First, find the total volume at equivalence. Initial solution was 40 cm³, and adding 10 cm³ NaOH gives 50 cm³ total. Moles of acetate are 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb for acetate is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² ≈
