Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to find the major products for each, then match them with the options given. The options are a bit complex, but I'll take it one at a time.

First, looking at Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ probably refers to some acidic work-up after the reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, right? So the structure has a spiro ring—nonane with a vinyl group and an enol. Let me imagine the structure: it's a spiro compound where one ring is a 5-membered (from the non-5-en part) and the other is a 3-membered? Or wait, spiro[3.5]non-... So the nonane is the main chain, and the spiro connects a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring?

Wait, no. Spiro compounds are numbered such that the spiro atom is the point where two rings meet. So spiro[3.5]non- would mean that the nonane has a bridge connecting atoms 1 and something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the spiro is between a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring. Let me think: the main chain is 9 carbons (nonane), and the spiro connects at position 1, so the rings are in positions 1-3 and 1-5? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe that's not critical right now.

The reaction is with KH in THF, which is a strong base, and then H+ is added. I think that in such conditions, the enol (the alcohol with an adjacent double bond) might undergo some kind of elimination or perhaps a conjugate addition, or maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Wait, another thought—maybe it's a
