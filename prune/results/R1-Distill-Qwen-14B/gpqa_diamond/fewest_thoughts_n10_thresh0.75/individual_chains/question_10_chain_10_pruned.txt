Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. The question is asking which of the four options has the highest density. Let me try to break this down.

The options are a, b, c, d. Each describes a planet with certain properties. I need to compare their densities.

Option a is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Wait, no, Earth's average density is actually around 5.5 g/cm³, so if it's Earth mass and radius, its density would be the same as Earth's. So option a has a density of 5.5.

Option b is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but density is given as 5.5, so that's the same as Earth. But wait, no, the option says the planet has a density of approximately 5.5. So the density is 5.5 regardless of mass, so option b's density is 5.5 as well.

Wait, but the question is about density, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think. Each option is a planet, and I need to calculate their densities.

Option a: same as Earth, so density is 5.5.

Option b: mass is 2 Earth masses, density is 5.5. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the planet in option b has a density of 5.5. So the density is 5.5, which is same as Earth. So then, what's different? Because the question is about density, perhaps option b's density is fixed. So if it's 5.5, same as a.

Wait, maybe I'm misreading the options. Let me read again.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. So their density is 5.5. So that's same as Earth.

Wait, but if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but density is 5.5, what's the radius? Because density is mass/volume. So if mass is 2, then volume would be mass/density. Earth's volume is (4/3)πR³. So if the planet's density is same as Earth, but mass is double, then its radius would be bigger. Because mass is 2, density same
