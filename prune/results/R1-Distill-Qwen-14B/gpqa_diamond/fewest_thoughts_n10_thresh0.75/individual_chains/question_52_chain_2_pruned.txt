Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the question involves a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. When the star isn't spotted, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They mentioned that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (levels 1 and 2) decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

Wait, and the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Angstroms. Oh, and the photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That probably means I can use the Boltzmann equation for the energy levels.

Let me recall the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)). Since the transition is at 1448 Å, maybe I can find the energy difference from the wavelength.

First, I should calculate the energy difference between the two levels. The energy E of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) 

Calculating that: let's see, numerator is ~1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 1448e-10 m is the same as multiplying by 1e10/1448.

So 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, but I think it's easier to work in terms of eV. Oh wait, right, because when you're dealing with atomic energy levels, it's often in electron volts. So maybe I should convert that energy to eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Hmm, wait, that seems a bit high. Wait, wait, let me recalculate the energy more carefully.

Wait, let me compute hc/(lambda) in eV·Å because that might be a common value. I remember that hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å. So, wavelength λ is 1448 Å. So E (in eV) is approximately 12400 / 1448 ≈ let's calculate that.

1448 goes into 12400 how many times? 1448 * 8 = 11584, and 1448*8.5 is 12316. Hmm, wait 1448 * 8.55 is let's see:

1448 * 8 = 11584

1448 * 0.5 = 724 → 11584+724=12308

1448 * 0.05 = 72.4 → 12308 +72.4=12380.4 → 8.55 gives 12380.4, which is just under 12400. So 8.55 would give 12380.4, so for 12400, it's about 8.55 + (19.6 / 1448). 19.6/1448 ≈ 0.0135. So E
