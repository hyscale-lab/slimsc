Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

Astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. When the star's surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They observed the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So the ratio is N1/N2, where N1 and N2 are the number of atoms in two energy levels. And this ratio goes down when spots are present. So without spots, the ratio is higher. I need to find the factor, which is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, but why would the ratio change when the star has spots? Oh, because the spots are cooler regions. So when spots are present, the overall photosphere's average temperature changes. But how does that affect the excitation of atoms in different energy levels?

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the populations of energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations between two levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

So the ratio of n1/n2 would be the inverse of that. So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me get that right. The Boltzmann factor is (n_j)/(n_i) = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k*T) )

So for level 1 and level 2, if level 2 is higher in energy, then E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio (n2/n1) smaller. So n2 would decrease relative to n1 when T drops.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So the average temperature of the photosphere is lower. Since the spots are cooler, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K, but 40% is covered, but wait, I'm not sure if the Teff is the average or if the model is considering the spots as regions with lower T.

Wait, the star's Teff when not covered is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Because the effective temperature is the average based on the total emitted flux. So the presence of spots, which are cooler, would cause the overall flux to be lower, hence lower Teff.

But for the purpose of this
