Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should recall what Grubbs catalyst does. I remember that Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, it's all about breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. So, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. But wait, actually, pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-something? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it correctly. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So numbering from the double bond, which is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait no, wait. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The third carbon is CH2CH(CH3) in the chain. Wait, no. Let me count again. The structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. If it's 3-methyl, then the third carbon (the one attached to the double bond) has a methyl group.

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? But that would be four carbons plus the methyl? Wait, no. Let me number the carbons properly. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the chain is C1 (CH2), C2 (CH), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH
