Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments.

Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is a chiral molecule. Let me draw its structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3, right? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would be on the third carbon of a five-carbon chain. Let me think.

Wait, pentene is five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's five carbons. Let me write it correctly: the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Wait I'm getting confused.

Wait, the general formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂. Wait, but that's four carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH
