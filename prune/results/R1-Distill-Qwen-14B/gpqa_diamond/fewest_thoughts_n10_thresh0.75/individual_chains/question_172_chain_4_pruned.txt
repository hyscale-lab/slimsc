Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, excitation here refers to the energy levels the electrons are in, I think. So the higher the excitation, the more energy the atoms have.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's a specific value. But the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars, T1 and T2.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I remember that the distribution of atoms in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is something like: (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -Î”E / (k*T) )

Here, n_upper and n_lower are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels, and g's are the statistical weights. Oh wait, but in this problem, they mention the excitation level, so perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state or another state?

The problem says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.
