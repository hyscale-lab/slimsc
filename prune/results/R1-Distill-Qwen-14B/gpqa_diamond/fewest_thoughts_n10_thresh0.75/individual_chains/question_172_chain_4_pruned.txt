Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Okay, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the temperature. In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation is determined by the Boltzmann equation.

Right, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's say the excited state is E_i and the ground state is E_j. The ratio of the excited to unexcited atoms in each star would be governed by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as n1 and for star_2 as n2. So n1 = 2 * n2. But wait, since the question states that the excitation is twice as much, perhaps the ratio of excitation is (n_i)/(n_j) for each star. Let me clarify: for star_1, the excitation level (n_i1 / n_j1) is twice that of star_2. So (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2).

Assuming the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since it's the same transition in iron), they cancel out. So the equation becomes (exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) )^{-1} = 2 * (exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)) )^{-1}.

Wait, let me write that correctly. The Boltzmann factor is (n_i / n_j) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So for
