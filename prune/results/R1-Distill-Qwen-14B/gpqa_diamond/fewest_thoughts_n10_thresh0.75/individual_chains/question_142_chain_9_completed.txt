Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think this through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, isn't that a diagonal matrix? Because |0⟩⟨0| has 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere, same with |1⟩⟨1|. So when I add them, the diagonal elements are 1 each, but since it's multiplied by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Right, so the density matrix is diagonal with both diagonal entries 1/2. That tells me the state is a completely mixed state. Because if it were a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |0⟩⟨0|, which has 1 in one diagonal and 0 elsewhere. But here, both are 1/2, so it's a 50-50 mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm trying to remember how density matrices correspond to vectors. Oh wait, I think this has to do with the Bloch sphere. Right, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in the Bloch sphere, which is a geometric way to visualize quantum states.

The general form for a single qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. The vector r is the Bloch vector. So when you write ρ in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices, the coefficients give the components of r.

Let's write out the given ρ. It's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = (1/2)I. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| equals the identity matrix I for a single qubit system. So ρ = (I + 0·σ)/2? Wait, because I is the identity matrix, so (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2 = our ρ.

Wait, our ρ is (I)/2, which would imply that the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. Because when I expand (I + r·σ)/2, the diagonal terms are (1 + r_z)/2, and the off-diagonal terms are (r_x/2) and (r_y/2i), but in our case, the off-diagonal terms are zero because the density matrix is diagonal.

So the off-diagonal terms in (I + r·σ)/2 are (r_x/2) for the (0,1) and (1,0) positions, and (r_y/(2i)) for the (0,1) and (1,0) but those are imaginary parts, but since our density matrix has real entries, those must be zero. So r_x and r_y must be zero.

The diagonal elements (top left and bottom right) are (1 + r_z)/2 each. In our case, both are 1/2, so (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. Solving for r_z: 1 + r_z =1 → r_z =0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would be the origin in the qubit space. So the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because it's a maximally mixed state. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → Not zero, so no.

B) (0,0,1) → Hmm, r_z is 1? No, we got r_z=0.

C) (0,0,0) → Yes, this matches.

D) (1,1,1) → All components 1, no.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \(1/2\). Since it is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities for the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), it represents a completely mixed state. 

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). Additionally, the diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are \(1/2\), which corresponds to \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector \(r\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix is at the origin in qubit space.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This is incorrect because the Bloch vector components are not 1.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** This is incorrect because \(r_z = 0\), not 1.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** This is correct, as the Bloch vector components are all zero.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This is incorrect because none of the components are 1.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, corresponding to the completely mixed state.

Answer: C
