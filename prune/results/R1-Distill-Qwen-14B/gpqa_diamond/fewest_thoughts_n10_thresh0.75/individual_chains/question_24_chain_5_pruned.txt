Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving mixtures X, Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. Let me break it down.

So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. I know that substances that decolorize bromine water are typically those with unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes. But since it's a mixture of two liquids, perhaps they're both alkenes or maybe one is an alkene and the other is something else that can also react with bromine.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. The process is called disproportionation, which implies that one of the reactants is both oxidized and reduced. So probably, one of the components in X is getting split into two different products in Y, each with different oxidation states.

Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Furthermore, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen.

Hmm. Let's think about Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, if Z is a hydrocarbon (C and H only), let's find its molecular formula.

Let’s calculate. The percentage of hydrogen is about 14.28%, so carbon would be 85.72% roughly. Let me assume a molecule with formula CnHm.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 =14.28. Let's compute:

14.28 = (m/(12n + m)) * 100
=> m/(12n + m) = 0.1428
Multiply both sides by denominator:
m = 0.1428*(12n + m)
m = 1.714n + 0.1428m
m - 0.1428m = 1.714n
0.8572m = 1.714n
Divide both sides by 0.8572 (approximately 1/12):
m ≈ (1.714 / 0.8572) * n
1.714/0.8572 is about 2, so m≈2n.

Possible formula: CnH2n. That's an alkene or alkyne. Wait, but Z doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds, as per the problem statement. Oh, wait, no: the problem says that mixture X has no conjugated multiple bonds. So Z is a product of hydrogenation, which probably adds H2 across double bonds.

Wait, Z is a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation of X and Y. So if X has alkenes, hydrogenation would produce alkanes. But Z is a constituent of Y, which is formed after the reaction of X with Pt and heat, which is a disproportionation.

Wait, let me think again. X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. So X has unsaturated molecules. When treated with Pt and heat (probably catalytic hydrogenation but maybe other reactions), they form Y. Disproportionation usually involves a species being both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps one component of X is an alkyne, which upon hydrogenation (with Pt) becomes an alkane, and the other component is something else that also reacts.

Wait, but after hydrogenation of X and Y, we get Z, which is a hydrocarbon, and Z is in Y. Let me think about Z. Let's compute its formula.
