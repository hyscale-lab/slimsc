Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? Oh, and in the problem statement, E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level can be expressed as E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. So for identical particles like electrons, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric when you swap any two particles. But in this case, since the particles are in a one-dimensional well, each particle's state is defined by its quantum number n and its spin.

So each particle can occupy a state characterized by a principal quantum number n and a spin state. Since they are spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: spin-up and spin-down.

Now, the well is one-dimensional, so the spatial part of the wavefunction must be symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, in
