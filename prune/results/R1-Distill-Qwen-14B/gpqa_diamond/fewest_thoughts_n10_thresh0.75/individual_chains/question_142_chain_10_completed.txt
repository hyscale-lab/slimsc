Okay, so I need to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. So it's a completely mixed state, meaning it's the maximally uncertain state.

I think the density matrix of a pure state like |0⟩⟨0| would be a pure state, but here it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ each with equal probability, right? So the state is a statistical mixture, not a coherent superposition. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that exactly means. Oh wait, I think qubit space can be visualized using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states are points on the surface and mixed states are inside the sphere.

So a maximally mixed state would be at the center of the Bloch sphere because it's the most mixed state possible. The center corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is (I + 0)/2, but wait, I think the maximally mixed state is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Which is exactly what ρ is. So ρ is the center point.

Wait, but the options are given as r=(some coordinates). How does the Bloch sphere translate to coordinates? Oh, right, the Bloch vector represents the state. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r gives the coordinates on the Bloch sphere.

So for the maximally mixed state, ρ = I/2, because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| equals I (the identity matrix). So ρ = I/2. Substituting into the general form, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides, 0 = r·σ. So r must be zero. Because if r is zero, then r·σ is zero, and ρ is I/2.

So the Bloch vector r is at (0,0,0), which is the origin. Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which is the center. So the correct position is at the origin.

Wait, any chance I mixed up the coordinates? Let me think again. The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z). For the state ρ, the components are (each component in the Pauli matrices). So when r is zero, all components are zero. So the point is the center, which matches option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation of qubit states, pure states lie on the surface, while mixed states are inside the sphere. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the point (0,0,0).

To confirm this, recall that the general form of a density matrix in terms of the Pauli matrices is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \vec{r} \) is the Bloch vector. For the given density matrix, \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \vec{r} = (0,0,0) \). This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0,0,0) \), which matches option C.

Answer: C
