Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ·n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ·n is the dot product between the Pauli matrices and a unit vector n. 

Wait, Pauli matrices... Each σ_i is a 2x2 matrix. Oh right, and the dot product would be σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

So H is a 2x2 matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Specifically, the eigenvalues are (trace ± sqrt(trace^2 - 4 determinant))/2.

But wait, another approach: the Pauli matrices are traceless and each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. Oh wait, no. Wait, each σ_i has eigenvalues +1 and -1 because σ_i squared is the identity matrix. 

Wait, let me think again. The Hamiltonian H is ε times a unit vector dotted into the Pauli matrices. So H is proportional to a Pauli matrix in some direction. 

Alternatively, since H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), and since σ·n is a Hermitian operator (because σ_i are Hermitian and n is real), the eigenvalues should be real.

What's the trace of H? The trace is ε (n_x Tr(σ_x) + ... ), but σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have trace zero, right? Because their diagonal elements are 1 and -1, so trace is zero. So the trace of H is zero. 

The determinant of H: I think the determinant of a 2x2 matrix like a σ·n would be (ε^2)(n·σ)^2. Wait, but (n·σ)^2 is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) times identity matrix? Oh wait, because σ_i squared is I. So (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding that, you get each σ_i squared times n_i^2, which is I*(n_i^2), and the cross terms involving σ_i σ_j. But wait, for i ≠ j, σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k, which is an imaginary term. But when you square the sum, those cross terms come in as 2 times the sum over i<j of σ_i σ_j. But when you compute (σ·n)^2, the cross terms would involve σ_i σ_j terms, which anti-commute. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to note that (σ·n)^2 = (n·σ)(n·σ) = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. 

But wait, σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when you sum over i and j, you get n_i n_j (δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k). Wait, but summing over i and j, n_i n_j δ_ij is sum n_i^2 = |n|^2 =1 since n is a unit vector. So the first term is I. The second term is i ε_ijk n_i n_j σ_k. But I think that term might vanish because n is a unit vector, but wait I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps (σ·n)^2 = I, because the Pauli matrices satisfy (σ·n)^2 = I for any unit vector n. Let me check that. Suppose n is along z-axis, so σ·n = σ_z. Then (σ_z)^2 = I. Yes. If n is in some arbitrary direction, (σ·n)^2 is I. Because for any unit vector, the square would be I.

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute (σ·n)^2. It's sum_{i,j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. Now, σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k. So, the sum becomes sum n_i n_j δ_ij I + sum n_i n_j (i ε_ijk σ_k). The first term is sum n_i^2 I = I, since n is a unit vector. The second term is i times ε_ijk n_i n_j σ_k. Summing over i and j. Hmm, but for each k, the term would be something like ε_ijk n_i n_j. But for each k, the sum over i and j of ε_ijk n_i n_j. I think that sum is zero. Because ε_ijk is antisymmetric under exchange of i and j, and n_i n_j is symmetric. So when you sum over i and j, they might cancel each other out. For example, take k=1, then sum i,j: ε_1ij n_i n_j. But ε_1ij is antisymmetric in i and j, and n_i n_j is symmetric, so their product is antisymmetric. The sum over i,j of an antisymmetric matrix is zero. So the second term is zero. Therefore, (σ·n)^2 = I. 

So back to H. H is ε (σ·n). So H squared is ε² (σ·n)^2 = ε² I. So the eigenvalues of H squared are ε² and ε². Wait, that can't be. Or, wait, no, because H is a 2x2 matrix, so H² = ε² I. So the eigenvalues of H² are (ε²) each with multiplicity 1. 

But what about the eigenvalues of H itself? Let me think. If H squared is ε² I, then H must be a multiple of the Pauli matrices. Let me think of H as a matrix. Let me write H as H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) = ε σ·n. 

The eigenvalues λ of H must satisfy H |ψ> = λ |ψ>. So H squared |ψ> = λ² |ψ> = (ε σ·n)^2 |ψ> = ε² I |ψ> = ε² |ψ>. So λ² = ε². So λ can be ε or -ε. Thus, the eigenvalues of H are +ε and -ε. 

So looking back at the options, option B is "+ε, -ε." Option C is with hbar/2, which I don't think applies here. Because in the expression, ε is given as an energy constant, so the eigenvalues are ±ε. 

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So if H is ε times a unit vector dotted into the Pauli matrices, then H's eigenvalues
