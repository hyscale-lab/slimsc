Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves interactions between charges, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach this.

Alright, so the setup is that there's a conducting sphere with radius R and it's grounded. Grounded means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow away. Wait, no, wait: if it's grounded, the potential of the sphere is zero because it's at Earth's potential. But when a charge is placed near it, things might change.

The charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere. So the distance from the charge to the surface of the sphere would be d - R, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

I think the key here is to find the potential energy of the charge q in the electric field created by the conducting sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, how does that affect the induced charges?

Wait, when you have a conducting sphere and you place a charge nearby, the conductor will experience electrostatic induction. The induced charges redistribute themselves such that the interior of the conductor remains at zero potential (since it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges on the sphere can flow into the ground. So the sphere itself might not have any net charge because any induced charges would be neutralized by the ground connection.

Wait, no, wait
