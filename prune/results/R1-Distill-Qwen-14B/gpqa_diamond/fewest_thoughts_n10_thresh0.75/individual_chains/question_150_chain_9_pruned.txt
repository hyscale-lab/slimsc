Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Oh wait, that's important. Let me break it down. The molecular formula is C8H9NO: that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. So the degree of unsaturation might help. Let's calculate that. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring, a double bond, or triple bonds. Since the product will go through reactions, I need to figure out the structure first.

The NMR data is given: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me try to interpret this. 

Starting with the 9.72 ppm signal as a triplet, that's probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and show up as triplets if adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe it's an aldehyde attached to a CH2, like R-CHO-CH2-X?

Then looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each with two equivalent H. So maybe two benzene rings, each with a substituent. The 6.98 is a downfield shift, perhaps para-substituted phenyl groups with electron-withdrawing groups. The 6.51 is a doublet, maybe another pair of substituents.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad usually indicates exchange, maybe an -OH group, but it's 2H, so maybe two aromatic protons in a different environment, like adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, it could be a dienol or something.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something deshielded, maybe an oxygen. Like OCH2 or NHCH2, but since the molecular formula has an O and N, maybe it's an OCH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group, two phenyl groups attached, and an OCH2 group. Let me think: the 3.66 ppm could be part of a CH2-O, maybe attached to a benzene ring. The triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde next to a CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with substituents. Alternatively, it could be a substituted acetophenone, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the possible reactions.

The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually
