Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. There's some NMR data provided, and then a series of reactions with specific reagents. The task is to identify the final product from the given options.

First, I'll break down the problem into parts. I think I should start by analyzing the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. Once I have that, I can follow the reactions step by step to find out what the product is.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, N is 1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9)/2 = 9/2 =4.5? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the degree of unsaturation should be an integer. Maybe I did the formula wrong. Oh wait, the formula is 2C +2 - H - X + N divided by 2. Let me plug in the numbers again.

2*8=16, +2=18. H is 9, X is 0, N is 1. So, 18 -9 +1 = 10. 10/2=5. Okay, that's better. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and some double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. Triplets suggest coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This could be aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons, maybe ortho or meta to something
