Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given by |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>]/N, where α is the amplitude, φ is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization is given as N = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). 

The relative entropy measure is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state. I need to find the nG when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I should understand what the Schrödinger cat state looks like. It's a superposition of two coherent states, |α> and |-α>, scaled by cos(phi) and sin(phi) respectively. The normalization N ensures that the state is properly normalized.

Wait, the question is about non-Gaussianity. Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it non-Gaussian. So, the non-Gaussianity quantifies how non-Gaussian this state is.

The relative entropy method compares the entropy of the state to that of a Gaussian reference. If the state is Gaussian, their entropies should match, giving zero non-Gaussianity.

But how do I compute del_b? Let's write down the steps.

1. Compute the density matrix rho of |ψ>. Since |ψ> is a pure state, rho is |ψ><ψ|.

But maybe I don't need the exact form for this problem. Wait, looking at the options, maybe there's a trick.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, let's compute sin(2φ). Since 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let's compute that.

Alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. 2*alpha² is 0.5. exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but wait a minute. N is a normalization factor, so it must be real and positive. Let's compute 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2). With sin(2phi) = -1, and exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |ψ> is [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>]/0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |ψ> = [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, this looks like an equal superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, but with a negative sign on the second term. That's a symmetric kind of state but with a phase difference.

Wait, but rho is |ψ><ψ|, so it's a pure state. The density matrix of a pure state is a projection operator.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau. I think for the relative entropy method, the reference state is usually the closest Gaussian state to the given state. Alternatively, sometimes people take the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

Wait, the question says that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps the reference is the thermal state or some other Gaussian state. Alternatively, maybe it's the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the non-Gaussian state and that of the best matching Gaussian state. So, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in terms of relative entropy.

Alternatively, the problem might be using a specific Gaussian state as a reference. Maybe the reference is the vacuum state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. Let me compute N again for these values.

N^2 = 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²) = 1 + (-1)(exp(-0.5)).

Which is 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is |ψ> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but maybe I should consider what happens when the state is a superposition of two coherent states. For coherent states |α> and |-α>, their Wigner functions are Gaussian and located at (α,0) and (-α,0) in phase space. The superposition would create an interference pattern, making the Wigner function non-Gaussian.

The non-Gaussianity is the difference in entropies. So if the state is Gaussian, the entropy would be the same as the reference, so del_b would be zero.

Wait, but how can a superposition of coherent states be Gaussian? Only if it's not a true superposition, like a cat state, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but maybe when the state is a coherent state itself
