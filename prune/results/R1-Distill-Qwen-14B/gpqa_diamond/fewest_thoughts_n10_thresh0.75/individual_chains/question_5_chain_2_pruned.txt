Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied. So, P acting on the eigenvector gives (ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

They provided the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down the given information:

- P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait a second, these look familiar. Oh right! These are the spin matrices for a spin-½ particle, like a muon. The operator P here is the spin operator, I think. So, P is probably the spin angular momentum operator.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So it's a direction that can be represented with some polar coordinates. But wait, if it's in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal angle) would be 0 or 180 degrees because the direction is along x-z. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or π, because the y-component is zero. Alternatively, maybe the direction is given by some angle θ from the z-axis, since it's in x-z plane. So, the general direction would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in x-z, phi is 0, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ?), or wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or 180 degrees. So the direction vector n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when phi is 0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) when phi is π. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Wait, the operator P is along the direction n. So the total operator P is given by P = (P_x, P_y, P_z), and the component along n would be n · P, which is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator P_n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the problem is to find the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me think about how to construct P_n. Let me denote the components of n as (a, 0, b). Since it's a unit vector, a² + b² = 1. So a = sinθ, b = cosθ, assuming θ is the polar angle. Or wait, maybe a is cosθ and b is sinθ if θ is measured from the x-axis. No, wait, usually θ is measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. But since n is in x-z, φ is 0, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = (sinθ)(P_x) + (cosθ)(P_z).

Each of P_x, P_y, P_z are 2x2 matrices scaled by ħ/2.

So substituting the matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_n = (sinθ)*(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)*(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. The scalar (ħ/2) can be factored out.

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-
