Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's see what it says. So the question is about a spin 1/2 particle. I remember that spin is a form of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

The setup is that initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with this field. So I think that means the spin is along +Z. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Wait, so after the field changes, how does the magnetic moment behave in the z-direction? They say it starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and how the state evolves over time. The oscillations in expectation values often relate to transitions between energy eigenstates and the energy differences, which link to frequency via the energy-time uncertainty principle or something like that.

Originally, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B, which in this case is -gamma Sz B. Wait, no, actually, the magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, so the energy is H = -mu · B. So H_initial = -gamma Sz B_z. Since B is along +Z, B_z = B, so H_initial = -gamma B Sz.

If the particle is in a magnetic field along Z, the energy levels are E = -gamma B (m_s), where m_s is ±1/2 for spin-1/2. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (1/2) and E_- = -gamma B (-1/2) = +gamma B (1/2).

But then the magnetic field is turned off and another one is applied along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu · B, with B along Y. So H_final = -gamma Sz B_y? Wait, no. Wait, mu is along
