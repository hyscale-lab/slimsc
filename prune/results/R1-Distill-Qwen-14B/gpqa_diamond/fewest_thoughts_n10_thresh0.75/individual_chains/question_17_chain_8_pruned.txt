Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K here is probably the formation constant, right? Because EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) tells us how stable the complex is.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. So, I think I need to use the formation constant equation. The formation constant Kf is given by the formula:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, I can assume that initially, all the calcium is tied up in the complex. But wait, since EDTA is a chelator, the complex dissociates a little bit, releasing some Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very low, given the high Kf value (which suggests a very stable complex, so not much dissociation).

Let me think about the setup. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x.
