Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So the question is about a Ca-EDTA complex.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's stoichiometric here mean? Oh right, it means that the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1. So each formula unit has one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- or something like that.

The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. Oh, pH ideal probably means that the solution is buffered so that the pH doesn't affect the dissociation of EDTA, which can complicate things. Because EDTA's ability to form complexes depends on its deprotonation state. So assuming pH is perfect, I don't have to worry about that.

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. Wait, K is the formation constant. Formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (I think the charge would be 2- if Ca is +2 and EDTA is 4- in the complex).

Wait, the K here is K_ca-edta = 5e10. So Kf is 5e10. The formula I remember is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Since the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, that's the concentration of CaEDTA^2-.

So let's think about it. Let me write the equation:

Kf = [Complex] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA] )

Given Kf is 5e10, and [Complex] is 0.02 M.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, right? Because the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates.

Wait, but wait. The complex is CaY²- (Y is EDTA), and it dissociates as:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

So the initial concentrations: [CaY²-] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [Y^4-] = 0.

Change: [CaY²-] decreases by x, [Ca²+] increases by x, [Y^4-] increases by x.

So at equilibrium, [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small compared to 0.02 because Kf is large, which makes the dissociation small).

So, Kf = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY²-] = (x * x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02.

Set that equal to 5e10:

x² / 0.02 = 5e10 → x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait, wait, that can't be right because 3.16e4 is larger than 0.02, which would make [CaY²-] negative. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, right, because Kf is very large, the dissociation is minimal. So x should be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02. But wait, in that case, x² = Kf * 0.02 → x² =5e10 * 0.02 → 1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)= 3.16e4 M? That's impossible because 3.16e4 is way larger than 0.02.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up the equation.

Wait, Kf is 5e10. Let me re-calculate:

x² / 0.02 = 5e10 → x² = 5e10 * 0.02 → 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)= 3.16e4 M. That can't be possible because the initial concentration is 0.0
