Okay, I have this question about quantum mechanics applied to diatomic molecules. Hmm, the question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but here it's allowed to stretch a bit, incorporating vibrational energy levels as well.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state refers to the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (maybe J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, no, for a diatomic molecule, the ground state is typically the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0).

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. So that would be the next state, which could be an increase in either vibrational or rotational energy. But I'm not sure whether the question is about a pure rotation transition or a pure vibration transition. Wait, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, right, that's the next state in terms of energy, which would be the first excited state. So probably, it's the first energy level above the ground state.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels include both rotational and vibrational contributions. But for the transition, perhaps the photon would cause a change in either the vibrational or rotational state. Since the problem is asking about the photon's momentum, which relates to its energy (because p = E/c, but since we're in units where c isn't directly needed here, maybe I'll handle it through energy considerations).

Wait, let me recall the energy levels for a diatomic molecule. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = ( (v + 1/2) * h * w ), where w is the angular frequency.

In the rigid rotor-vibration model (or non-rigid?), the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. But when you're in the fundamental state, you're at the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (J=0).
