Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Hmm, let's read the question again.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Wait, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Oh right, and the stereochemistry of the alkene affects the epoxide's structure.

So Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene reacting with mCPBA. Since it's E, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. The epoxidation would form an epoxide where the oxygen is in a specific configuration. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening.

Wait, how does the ring opening work? In acidic conditions, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens via a carbocation mechanism. But wait, the epoxide's structure depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Let me think: For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans. So the epoxide would form a trans epoxide. When that epoxide is treated with acid, it would form a diol. Wait, but how does the ring opening proceed? Oh, right, the ring will open to give a trans-diol because in the acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon in a way that leads to the trans product. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. I might be getting this mixed up.

Wait, no, wait. For the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide: the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons electrophilic. The nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when it forms a carbocation. Hmm, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, like in octene, the carbons are both the same, so maybe it's not about substitution but about the structure.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, right? So the epoxide of (E)-oct-4-ene would be a trans epoxide. When it opens in acid, the water attacks both carbons from the same face? Or opposite faces? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize.

In a trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So when the acid protonates the oxygen, the two carbons become positively polarized. Water (as a nucleophile) can attack from either side. But in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like from E-octene, the ring opening would form a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans)?

Wait, no, wait. For E-alkene epoxidation, the epoxide is formed with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So (E)-oct-4-ene becomes an epoxide where the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. Then, under acidic conditions, the ring opens. The ring opening typically leads to trans-diol because of the way the nucleophile attacks. Wait, no—wait, in the acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side because the epoxide's oxygen is protonated and the ring opens with a backside attack.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the specific case. When you have an epoxide from E-octene, which is symmetric, the ring opening in acid would lead to a specific diastereomer. Hmm, but wait, for symmetric epoxides, the ring opening in acid would produce a single diol, but in this case, maybe it's the same for both E and Z alkenes.

Wait, hold on, maybe I should think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide (trans configuration). Then, aqueous acid → ring opening to form a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening would produce a single product. Because when the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening can't produce more than one product. So, both E and Z should give a single product each.

Wait, no, wait. In E, the epoxide is trans. So when it's opened under acid, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons but on opposite sides. Or, no—wait, let's imagine the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both sides. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. Wait, no, let's correct that. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write it correctly.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, octene is eight carbons. So, oct-4-
