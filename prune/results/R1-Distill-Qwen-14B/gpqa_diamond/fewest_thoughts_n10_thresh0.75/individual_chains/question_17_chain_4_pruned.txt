Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, so that's probably involved here.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, the complex is CaEDTA^2-, I think. The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. I'm trying to recall the formula for the formation of the complex. I think the reaction is something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. 

Wait, but in solution, EDTA exists in different forms depending on the pH. Oh, the question says the pH is ideal. I think that means we can assume that EDTA is in its deprotonated form, Y^4-, and all the EDTA is available for complexation. So, I don't have to worry about the alpha fraction here. That simplifies things.

So, the formation constant, K, is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, no, the formation constant is usually defined as Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, sometimes it's written as the inverse. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Formation constants are usually the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, if the reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, then Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] ). Yes, that's right.

The solution has a concentration of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca^2+ as x. But wait, how about the EDTA? Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, the EDTA concentration would be... Well, the initial EDTA concentration isn't given, but in a stoichiometric solution, each mole of CaEDTA corresponds to one mole of Ca^2+ and one of EDTA^4-. But wait, in solution, the EDTA is in excess? Or is it all
