Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a specific complex. The solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C with an ideal pH. The formation constant, K_ca-edta, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a metal ion like calcium forms a complex with a ligand like EDTA, the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of the stability of that complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

So, the problem says we have a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think about the formula for the Ca-EDTA complex. EDTA is usually in the form Y^4- when it's deprotonated, right? So the complex would be CaY^2-. The reaction for the formation would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but wait. The formation constant Kf is usually given as the equilibrium constant for the reaction. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But in this problem, I'm given KCa-EDTA, which I think refers to the formation constant Kf.

So, in the solution, the Ca-EDTA complex is present at 0.02 M. So initially, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. But because the Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. That means that the concentrations of the free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions in solution must be very low.

Wait, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+]. So I need to find [Ca^2+] when [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

Let me set up an ICE table. Initially, before dissociation, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But wait no, because the complex can dissociate. So when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, the complex is already formed. So perhaps the initial concentrations are different. Let me think again.

In the solution, the primary species is the complex, CaEDTA^2-. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But some of it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So, let me denote the change. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. Then, the change would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] decreases by x, so it becomes 0.02 - x.
[Ca^2+] increases by x, so
