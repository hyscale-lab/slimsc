Okay, so I have this question about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all starting with C6, varying in H and O counts.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching. A broad peak usually means hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is often a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe an conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with some substituents, or perhaps an amide. But since the options don't have nitrogen, probably not an amide. So maybe two carbonyl groups?

Wait, but if both 1700 and 1650 are present, that suggests two different types of carbonyls. Maybe one is a ketone and another is an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe one is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a lower wavenumber than a regular carbonyl. But wait, 1650 is lower than 1700. So maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a ketone with conjugation.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably.

Then the mass spec: a fragment peak at m/z 45. 45 is a common mass. Let me think: what molecular fragments have a mass of 45? It could be CH3CO+ (acetate ion, 45), or maybe something like (CH2)2O? Wait, CH3O would be 31, but maybe a larger group. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an ester group, like the loss of something.

So putting it all together. The molecular formula options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

I need to determine which one fits all the given data.

Let's think about each option.

FTIR: The broad peak suggests an O-H group. So the formula must have at least one O. All options except B and D have O? Wait no, B is C6H10O (so one O), D is C6H12O (one O), while A and C have two O's.

The two strong peaks in IR at 1700 and 1650 suggest two carbonyl groups. So the compound should have two carbonyls. So looking for formulas that have enough O to support that. A and C have two O's, which could mean two carbonyls (like ester, ketone, etc.), but B and D have only one O, which might not support two carbonyls. So probably, the correct formula is either A or C.

Looking at the NMR: presence of vinyl hydrogens. So the structure must have a double bond. So the compound is probably an ester with a double bond, or maybe a ketone with a double bond, but since there are two carbonyls, perhaps an ester.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula could help in determining the structure. Let's think about possible structures with O in the formula.

If the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C. The degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, C=6,
