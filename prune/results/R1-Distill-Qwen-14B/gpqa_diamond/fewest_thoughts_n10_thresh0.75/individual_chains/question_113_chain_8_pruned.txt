Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each of these is provided, and I have to choose the correct chemical formula among four options.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. They mentioned a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is lower than the typical O-H stretch for alcohols, which is usually around 3300-3500. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the O-H stretch in alcohols is a broad peak around 3300. Maybe a carbonyl group? No, the carbonyl is at 1700 and 1650. So the 3000 could be an O-H, maybe like in a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps an alcohol. But wait, the broad peak might also be from a conjugated O-H, or maybe an amine? No, because there's no mention of N in the options. So maybe an alcohol.

Then, the FTIR has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those are in the carbonyl region. 1700 is a typical region for a ketone or aldehyde, but wait, another peak at 1650. Hmm, that's lower, so maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group, like in a conjugated ketone or maybe an aromatic ring? So the compound could have two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another group that's causing a peak in that vicinity.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: several peaks, including some for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, perhaps an alkene group. So maybe an alkene and a carbonyl group are present.

The Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let's think, the molecular ion could break into smaller fragments. For example, the tropylium ion is m/z 91, but that's not relevant here. Wait, 45 might be from a CH3CO+ ion. Because the molecular weight of CH3CO+ is 45 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16= 24+3+16=43? Wait, that's 43, no. Wait, no, CH3CO+ would be (12*2)+(1*3)+(16) = 24+3+16=43? Wait, that can’t be right. Or maybe it's (12+1)*2 +16
