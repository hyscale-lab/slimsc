Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth at different times of the year. The formula for distance is something like distance = 1/parallax, but wait, what's the exact relation? Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So uniform distribution in the sky. I think that means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. But how does that translate when we look at parallax?

Parallax depends on distance. So the number of stars we see with a certain parallax depends on how many stars are at that distance. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a thin shell (at a certain distance) would increase with the surface area of that shell. Because as you go further out, the surface area of the sphere increases. So the number of stars at distance d (thick shell) would be proportional to the surface area, which is 4πd². So N ∝ d².

But wait, parallax is plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Substituting that in, N ∝ (1/plx)^2 → which is 1/plx². So the number of stars at a particular distance (hence parallax) is proportional to 1/(plx squared). But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So how does the density change with plx?

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I'm considering a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance would be from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx +dplx). But wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of shells in parallax space. Since parallax is a one-dimensional measure, but stars are distributed in three dimensions.

Another approach: The number of stars per unit volume in space is uniform. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. So in a small volume element dV, the number of stars is n dV.

Now, how does dV relate to parallax? Parallax plx = 1/d, so d=1/plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dd. So dV = 4πd² dd. Substituting d=1/plx, so dd = -d(plx) = - (1/(plx²)) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx → dd = -1/(plx²) dplx. So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx) )

Wait, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the number of stars, we just care about the magnitude. So dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, no, let me recheck.

Wait, dV = 4πd² dd. d is 1/plx, so d² is (1/plx)^2. Then, dd is - (1/plx²) dplx. Because plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Hmm, maybe I should express dV in terms of plx.

So, dV = 4π (d)^2 dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/(plx^2)) dplx ). Wait, that would be dV = 4π (1/plx²) * ( - 1/plx² dplx ). But wait, that seems to give dV = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx. But the negative sign just indicates the direction of integration, so when considering the number of stars, we can take the absolute value, so dV = 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

The number of stars in this volume element is n dV = n * 4π/(plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's for a thin shell in d. But wait, that's for a given distance, but in reality, when you have a range in plx, you're integrating over a range in d. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if you have a range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range depend on plx.

Let me think of it in terms of density. The number of stars per unit parallax interval would be the number of stars at each plx multiplied by the interval dplx. So the number is (number per plx) * dplx. But the number per plx is the number of stars at that specific plx, which depends on the number of stars in that shell.

Wait, in space, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dd is 4πd^2 * n * dd, where n is number density. So in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, the number is 4π (1/plx)^2 n * dd. But dd is related to dplx: since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

number = 4π n (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) dplx.

Again, ignoring the negative sign, it's 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is 4π n / plx^4. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

But wait, the options don't have a ~ 1/plx^4 option. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) ~ 1/plx^4
B) ~ 1/plx^2
C) ~ 1/plx^1
D) ~ 1/plx^3

Oh, option A is 1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the number of stars per unit distance is ~ 1/d^2, which is 1/(1/plx)^2 = plx^2. So that would be ~ plx^2. But that was for the number of stars per unit distance. But here, it's per unit plx.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me think about it differently.

The number of stars per unit volume is n. So in a thin shell between d and d+dd, the number is n * 4π d² dd.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the number is n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx) → which is n 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, another way: when you plot the number of stars against plx, the number decreases as you go to higher plx because the same volume element in plx space covers more volume in distance space, but wait, actually, higher plx means closer stars. Wait, no, higher plx is closer stars. So more stars would be at lower plx (further away), but the number per unit plx would decrease because each unit plx corresponds to a larger distance.

Wait, maybe an analogy with brightness. The number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on the surface area. So for each shell at distance d, the number is proportional to d². But when you plot this against plx (which is 1/d), the number would be proportional to (1/plx)^2, but how does this translate into per unit plx?

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a given range of parallax (say, plx to plx + dplx) is the integral of the number of stars per unit distance multiplied by the change in distance corresponding to that parallax range.

The number of stars per unit distance (d) is proportional to d^2. So number per unit distance is N_d = k * d², where k is a constant.

But d = 1/plx, so N_d = k * (1/plx)^2.

Now, how much does d change when plx changes by dplx?

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the number of stars in the range plx to plx + dplx is integral from plx to plx + dplx of N_d * |dd|.

Wait, no, it's the integral over plx from plx to plx + dplx of N_d * (d d in terms of plx).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars per unit plx as (dN)/(dplx) = (dN/d d) * (dd/dplx).

Because dN/d d is the number per unit distance, which is 4π d² n (number of stars per unit distance is 4π d² n).

Wait, no, number per unit distance is 4π d² n * dd, so the number per unit distance (d) is 4π d² n.

So dN/dd = 4π d² n.

But plx is 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → so dN/dplx = dN/dd * dd/dplx = 4π d^2 n * ( -1/plx^2 ).

But since we're taking the magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx^2) n * (1/plx^2) ) → 4π n (1/plx^4).

So dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4 → So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Which brings me back to option A.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by analyzing the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is given by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, and the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^2 \).

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).

Next, we consider the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \text{dplx} \)). The relationship between \( \text{d} \) and \( \text{dplx} \) is given by \( \text{dd} = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \text{dplx} \). Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars per unit distance, the number of stars per unit parallax range becomes proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**.
