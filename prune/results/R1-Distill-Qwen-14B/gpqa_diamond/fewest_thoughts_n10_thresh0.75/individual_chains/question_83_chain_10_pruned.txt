Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm続 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm続 of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. Let me break it down. First, the dilution. When you mix equal volumes of a solution, the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles per liter, and if you double the volume, the concentration halves. So the initial volume is 20 cm続, and we add another 20, making it 40 cm続 total.

So the initial concentration of acetic acid before adding NaOH is 0.05 M divided by 2. That would be 0.025 M. Because 20 mL + 20 mL = 40 mL, which is 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the concentration is 0.001 mol /
