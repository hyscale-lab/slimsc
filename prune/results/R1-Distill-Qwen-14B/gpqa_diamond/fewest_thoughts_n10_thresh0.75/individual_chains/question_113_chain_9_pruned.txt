Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I'll need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak—could that be a carboxylic acid? Or maybe a hydroxyl group from an alcohol or phenol? Hmm.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is where carbonyl groups (C=O) typically show up. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Sometimes, conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituent. Or maybe it's an amide? But I don't think that's the case here because the problem doesn't mention any NMR peaks that would suggest amine protons. 

Wait, another thought—maybe the 1650 peak is from a conjugated double bond, like an enone or something with a C=C next to a carbonyl. Or perhaps an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? But wait, aromatic C=C usually absorb around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit high for that. Or maybe it's an acidic proton somewhere else, but I'm not sure.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So that suggests there's an alkene (C=C) in the structure. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. That might tie into the IR data—maybe the 1650 cm^-1 is a conjugated C=C stretch. So if there's a carbonyl and a double bond nearby, the carbonyl peak might be lower because of
