Okay, so I've got this question about a science experiment involving molecular biology techniques, specifically dealing with vectors and transgenic mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment is to study their interaction's developmental fate. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, so in this case, the ligand and receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA stands for chicken beta-actin, I think, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of a second gene in a bicistronic construct without needing a separate promoter. So the ligand is translated first, then the receptor.

Looking at the vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. I'm remembering that loxP sites are used for Cre-mediated recombination. So when Cre is present, it would recombine and remove the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene (mCherry) to be expressed. But wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry, so perhaps the stop cassette is interrupting the ligand's expression unless Cre is present to remove it.

Wait no, maybe I got that wrong. The ligand ORF is upstream of mCherry, but with a stop cassette. So the ligand's coding sequence ends before the stop, which is between ligand and mCherry. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed, but since the ligand is under a strong promoter, it would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So perhaps the ligand protein would be attached to mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe the vector is set up such that the ligand is cloned before mCherry, but with a stop cassette in between. So mCherry isn't expressed unless the stop is removed. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, so when the vector is transfected, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would not unless Cre is present to excise the stop.

Wait, but the question says they used a bicistronic vector, so maybe the ligand and receptor are each under their own promoters? Or perhaps the construct is such that the ligand is expressed first, followed by the receptor via the IRES.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the two ORFs are in the same transcriptional unit. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, then the IRES, then the receptor. So the mRNA is one transcript, but the IRES allows the receptor to be translated after the ligand. So ligand is first, then receptor.

But then, between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP sites. And between receptor and eGFP, a stop cassette with lox2272 sites. Hmm, wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP that only recombines with Cre, but perhaps it's used for directional recombination. So when Cre is present, it would delete the stops.

Wait a second, maybe the setup is that without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP. So when Cre is introduced (like in the Cre-expressing mice), the stops are removed, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed as markers.

But wait, the question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre.

After the mice are born, they visualize under confocal. But they didn't see a green signal. The eGFP is part of the receptor construct, right? So the green signal should come from eGFP on the receptor.

Wait but why didn't they see it? Let's think about the expression.

The vector is a bicistronic construct, so the ligand and receptor are co-expressed. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, so it's expressed first. The receptor is after IRES, so in the same mRNA, and thus should be expressed in the same cells.

But when they made the mouse model, they probably used the Cre to delete the stop cassettes. Because the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice. So the mice would have their Cre active in cells where SOX10 is expressed, which is neural crest cells, perhaps.

Wait, but the construct itself, when transfected into cells, would have the stop cassettes. So in the primary astrocyte culture, when they transfected the plasmid, the ligand and receptor are under the construct. But in the mouse model, they've probably used the Cre to delete the stop cassettes, so that mCherry and eGFP are expressed.

So when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells, which are the cells expressing the ligand and receptor.

But in the experiment, after the offspring are born, they didn't see a green signal. So the eGFP on the receptor isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression of eGFP? If they are secreted and act on other cells, perhaps eGFP wouldn't be present in the same cell. But I'm not sure if this relates to the problem here.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why didn't the Western blot show expression? Because the question says that on Western blot, using total proteins, they saw a signal proportional to actin. So the proteins are being expressed. If the eGFP is part of the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein, then the receptor should be expressed and detected on the Western. But Western blot might not detect it if it's not properly processed, but since the signal is proportional to actin, perhaps the eGFP is expressed along with the receptor.

Wait, the question says that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them on Western blot after plasmid transfection. So during plasmid transfection (in vitro), the construct is expressed, and the Western shows signals. So the proteins are made. So the problem isn't expression in the cells, but perhaps in the mouse model.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. Then, when crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre would delete the stop cassettes in the SOX10-expressing cells, which are neural crest-derived cells. So the ligand and receptor would be expressed, along with mCherry and eGFP.

But in the Western blot after transfection, they saw the proteins, meaning the plasmid works. So in the mouse, the construct is correctly integrated, but in the offspring, they don't see eGFP.

Wait, but maybe the problem is with the frame of the receptor-eGFP. If the stop cassette isn't properly removed, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But according to the setup, the stop is between receptor and eGFP, so when Cre deletes the stop, the eGFP should be expressed in frame.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent proper expression. If the stop isn't removed correctly, perhaps the ORF is not in frame. But if the Cre is working, the stop is removed, and the eGFP should be in frame.

Wait, another possibility: the vector is designed so that when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the downstream ORF to be expressed. But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP is not expressed.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is present and active only in certain cells. So in the cells where Cre is active (like neural crest), the stop is removed, and the eGFP is expressed.

But the question is that after the mouse is born, they don't see any green signal. So in the offspring, in the cells that should express the receptor (neural crest-derived), the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection in primary astrocytes, which are not neural crest cells. So in the transfection, the ligand and receptor are expressed, and the Western shows the proteins. So the construct is working in vitro.

In the mouse, the construct is under the control of the CBA promoter and IRES, but the expression is dependent on Cre to remove the stops.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the initial vector has the stop cassettes, and when Cre is present, it deletes them.

Wait, perhaps in the mouse model, the Cre is not effectively recombining the stop cassettes. But the mouse was crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells.

Hmm. Another possibility: the vector uses loxP and lox2272 sites. LoxP is recognized by Cre, but lox2272 is a variant that doesn't recombine with wild-type Cre, I think. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, lox2272 is a Cre variant, but I might be confused. Alternatively, perhaps lox2272 is a different site that requires Cre for recombination as well.

Wait, if the vector uses two different lox sites, one for the ligand (loxP) and one for the receptor (lox2272), then using Cre would delete both stops. But perhaps the Cre used (from SOX10-Cre) isn't efficient in both lox sites. Or maybe in the vector, the ligand and receptor have their own lox sites, but the Cre can only recombine one of them.

Wait, the stop cassette between ligand and mCherry is loxP-stop-loxP. The stop between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272. Cre should recombine both, but perhaps the efficiency is an issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the mouse model doesn't have Cre, but the construct is in a loxP site. Wait, no, the SOX10-Cre mice are crossed to the homozygous construct mice.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the expression of the eGFP is being prevented because the stop cassette wasn't properly removed. If the stop is still there, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop cassette isn't removed, the receptor is expressed as ORF plus the stop, which would terminate before eGFP, making them out of frame. But wait, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor would be expressed, followed by a stop, then eGFP not expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so the receptor is followed by eGFP in frame.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the Cre is active, so the stop is removed, and the eGFP should be expressed in frame.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is not working properly. IRES elements require specific conditions for translation, but in the presence of Cre, the construct would allow the translation of both ligand and receptor.

Wait, another thought: the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So the receptor is a transmembrane protein, and eGFP is fused to its C-terminus. If the eGFP is not expressed, perhaps the fusion isn't correct, but in the Western, the presence of the receptor would show up. But in the question, the Western blot is checking for the overexpressed proteins, implying that the proteins are expressed.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is not being properly translated because the frame is wrong. Let me think about the DNA structure.

In the vector, the ligand ORF is first, followed by a stop cassette with loxP. Then mCherry. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by a stop cassette with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no, perhaps the vector is arranged as:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry

IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

So the construct is a single transcript, but the IRES allows the receptor to be translated after the ligand.

But with the stop cassettes, in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry (since the stop is between ligand and mCherry, so the ligand is read through and then mCherry is not expressed). The receptor would be expressed, but the stop after it would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

When Cre is present, it would delete the stop cassettes. So the ligand-mCherry would be expressed as a fusion, and the receptor-eGFP as a fusion.

But wait, no, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry. So with Cre, the stop is removed, so the mRNA would be ligand followed by mCherry. So the ligand and mCherry are in frame? So they are expressed as a fusion protein.

Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame, as the stop between them is removed.

So the problem is that in the offspring, the eGFP isn't being expressed. So why?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would happen if the stop wasn't properly removed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so the ORF is continuous.

Alternatively, maybe the vector is designed such that without Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but without the fluorescent proteins. But when Cre is present, the fluorescent proteins are expressed.

Wait, but the experiment's setup is different. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So the construct is in their genome. When they're crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine the lox sites in the neural crest cells, leading to expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But in the question, they are looking for eGFP in the offspring under the confocal. So the green signal is missing. So perhaps the Cre isn't working, or the recombination isn't happening.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, which means both alleles have the vector. SOX10-Cre is hemizygous, so the offspring would have Cre in the SOX10-expressing cells.

Alternatively, maybe the Cre isn't active, so the stops aren't removed. But why wouldn't Cre be active?

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being translated. But the Western blot would detect the receptor even if it's not functional.

Wait, another angle. The vector is bicistronic, so the ligand and receptor are on the same mRNA. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which I think allows it to be translated after the ligand.

But the presence of the stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) would prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP unless Cre is present to delete them.

So in the mouse model, the construct is present, but without Cre, the stops are in place. But when the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should delete the stops in the cells where SOX10 is expressed, which are neural crest-derived.

So in those cells, the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the offspring, they don't see any green signal. So maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed. But why?

Looking at the options:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so the ORF is continuous, meaning they should be in frame.

Wait, another possibility is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working. But the IRES is supposed to drive the translation of the receptor after the ligand. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functional, meaning that the receptor isn't being expressed. But then, the Western would show the ligand, but not the receptor. But the question says the Western shows signals proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be translated, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question states that the vector is a bicistronic vector with the ligand under CBA promoter and the receptor under IRES. So the IRES should allow the receptor's expression.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me reevaluate the options.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so I think it includes its own enhancers. So this might not be the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking properly, it wouldn't be at the cell surface. But the Western blot would detect it if it's made. The question says the signal is proportional to actin, implying the proteins are expressed, so maybe this is an issue. But the absence in the confocal suggests it's not on the surface.

But why would the eGFP not be on the surface? The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it should be on the surface. If it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe it's not properly folded or lacks a signal peptide. But the question doesn't mention any issues with other constructs.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being retained in the ER or Golgi, so it's not at the cell surface. But then, the Western blot would detect it because it's expressed, but the confocal wouldn't see it because it's not on the surface.

But the question says that in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin, so the proteins are expressed. So the eGFP is made but not on the surface, leading to no green signal in the confocal.

In that case, option B might be the reason. The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, so it doesn't reach the cell surface, and thus the confocal doesn't detect the green fluorescence.

Alternatively, option D, if the frame is incorrect, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no signal. But if Cre recombined correctly, the frame should be okay.

Wait, but the question states that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, meaning both copies of the gene have the vector. The Cre from the SOX10-Cre mice would recombine only in the neural crest cells, leading to expression of eGFP in those cells.

But in the Western blot, they used primary astrocyte cultures, which are not neural crest cells. So the stops wouldn't be recombined, and the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the question says that the Western blot shows signals. That suggests that the proteins are expressed, but maybe without the fluorescent tags because the stops aren't recombined in the astrocytes.

Wait, but the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, which might be the ligand and receptor. So the Western blot would detect the ligand and receptor, regardless of the fluorescent proteins.

Wait, perhaps the presence or absence of eGFP doesn't affect the Western blot detection of the receptor. The Western blot would just detect the receptor (without the GFP) and the ligand (without mCherry) regardless of the stop cassettes.

But in the mouse, the construct is in the genome. When the Cre is present, the stops are removed, so the eGFP and mCherry are expressed. So in the mouse's neural crest cells, the eGFP should be present.

But the confocal didn't show any green. So why?

Another possibility: the eGFP is not being translated because the ORF is not in frame. For example, if the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed, then the eGFP wouldn't be in frame with the receptor. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. But the Western blot would detect the receptor, which is expressed, but not the eGFP.

Wait, but the question doesn't mention anything about the Western blot in the mouse. The Western was done after transfection in primary astrocytes. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed in the mouse due to a frame shift.

Wait, but the frame is only an issue if the stop is removed. If the stop is not removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in the mouse model, the Cre is present, so the stop should be removed.

Another thought: the IRES might not be functional in the receptor's expression, leading to the receptor not being expressed. But then, the Western would show the ligand but not the receptor, but the question doesn't specify that.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop wasn't removed, eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so they should be in frame.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the stop cassettes in the wrong orientation. For example, the lox sites are in a way that when Cre deletes them, it disrupts the ORF. But that's more about the vector design, not the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes contain a stop codon that, when removed, doesn't restore the ORF properly. But that's more about the construct.

Wait, another angle: the vector is designed to have the ligand and mCherry in one cassette and the receptor and eGFP in another. The presence of the stop cassettes means that without Cre, mCherry and eGFP aren't expressed. When Cre is introduced, the stops are removed, allowing their expression.

In the mouse model, the construct is present, and when crossed to SOX10-Cre, the stops are removed in neural crest cells, leading to eGFP expression.

But the offspring didn't show any green signal under the confocal. So why?

Possibility: the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is off. If the stop cassette isn't correctly removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But with Cre, this shouldn't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses lox sites that are incompatible. For example, the lox2272 sites require a different Cre variant. But the SOX10-Cre is a wild-type Cre, so it can't recombine lox2272 sites. Oh, wait! Lox2272 requires Cre with a mutation, like the Cre/loxP system where lox2272 is a mutant site that can't be cut by wild-type Cre. So perhaps the vector uses loxP and lox2272 sites, and the Cre available (SOX10-Cre) can only cut loxP, not lox2272. That way, only the mCherry stop is removed, but the eGFP stop remains, preventing its expression. So the ligand-mCherry is expressed, but the receptor-eGFP isn't, because the lox2272 stop wasn't cut.

That would explain why the green signal (from eGFP) isn't present. So the issue is that the lox sites are different, and the Cre can't recombine both. So the stop between ligand and mCherry is removed, but the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking back at the vector setup:

Between ligand and mCherry is loxP-stop-loxP.

Between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272.

So the Cre used in the SOX10-Cre mice is wild-type, which can only cut loxP sites, not lox2272. Therefore, the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal in the confocal.

So the problem is that the Cre can't remove both stops because one is loxP and the other is lox2272, which requires a different Cre.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, but that's option D. Alternatively, perhaps it's because the stop wasn't removed, but the immediate answer is about the frame.

Wait, no. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the stop's presence would mean that the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't. But the question says the Western shows a signal proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are expressed.

Hmm, perhaps the construct's design is causing the issue. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor under IRES, but the stop cassettes are using different lox sites, so only the ligand's stop is removed. Thus, the ligand-mCherry is expressed, but the receptor-eGFP isn't.

But the question is about why the green signal isn't present. So it's because the eGFP isn't expressed, which is due to the stop not being removed.

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed, so the issue isn't the frame but the presence of the stop.

Wait, but the option says the proteins are not in frame. If the stop is removed, they should be in frame.

So perhaps the issue is that the stop isn't removed because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't present, leading to no green signal. But the options don't directly address this.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses IRES correctly, but the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 stop isn't cut by the Cre, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, the green signal is missing.

But the options don't directly address the lox sites. Let me check the options again.

Option A: paracrine relationship. That would mean ligand and receptor are on different cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells (neural crest). So perhaps not.

Option B: receptor in Golgi. Then, Western would detect it, but the confocal wouldn't. So possible.

Option C: enhancer missing. But the CBA promoter already has enhancer elements.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed. But with Cre, the stop should be removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector's design is such that the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP isn't properly flanked by lox sites, so Cre doesn't remove it. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question states that the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. Since the Cre used is wild-type, it can't cut lox2272, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

So the problem is that the Cre can't remove the stop. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would be that the stop isn't removed, but none of the options directly state that.

Looking at the options, the only one that relates is option D, which says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed, but the frame is correct. So the issue is the lack of Cre's ability to remove the stop. But the options don't mention that.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the vector design. The vector is bicistronic, so the ligand is first, then receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so it's always expressed. The receptor is under IRES, so it's co-expressed. But the stop cassettes affect the fluorescent proteins.

But another thought: when the vector is in the mouse, perhaps the ligand is expressed, but because the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor-eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason is that the stop isn't removed. But the options don't have that.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, assuming that the stop wasn't removed, leading to the eGFP not being in frame with the receptor. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses a single lox site, but the eGFP is in a different orientation, causing the frame to shift. But that's more about the construct design.

I think the most plausible answer is that the Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But since the options don't include that, I have to choose from the given options.

Looking again, the answer options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Unlikely because the construct is designed to express in the same cells.

B) receptor stuck in Golgi. Possible, but why would the Western show expression?

C) enhancer missing. Unlikely as CBA is strong.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But if the stop isn't removed, the issue is that the stop is present, not the frame. So perhaps the correct reasoning is that the stop isn't removed, so the frame isn't continuous. But the question says that the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is present, the receptor would be expressed as a separate ORF, and the eGFP wouldn't be. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the receptor would be. But in the confocal, we're looking for eGFP. So the reason for no eGFP is that the stop wasn't removed, but none of the options directly address that.

Wait, perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. If the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either. But the Western blot would detect the ligand but not the receptor. The question doesn't say that, though.

After all this, I think the most likely answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed, they should be in frame. So the issue is that the stop isn't removed, leading to them not being in frame. But I'm not entirely confident.

Another approach: the lox2272 requires a specific Cre variant. So the SOX10-Cre mice have wild-type Cre, which can't cut lox2272. Thus, the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't removed. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the answer is option D, as the stop isn't removed, leading to the eGFP not being in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses loxP and lox2272 for each stop, and only the loxP is cut by the Cre, so the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't. So only mCherry is expressed, but not eGFP.

In that case, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal. But the question is why.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because when the stop isn't removed, they're not in frame, so eGFP isn't expressed. But I'm not entirely sure, as I might be missing something about the vector's design.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) downstream of stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to remove the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal from eGFP is observed in the offspring under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This implies the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is designed for co-expression in the same cells (neural crest cells), and the absence of eGFP fluorescence is not explained by a paracrine relationship. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, and no green signal would be observed in the confocal. However, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, indicating that the receptor and eGFP are being expressed. This suggests the issue is not with trafficking but rather with expression of eGFP. Thus, this option is less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter with inherent enhancer elements. There is no indication that the enhancer is missing, making this option unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP must be removed by Cre to allow in-frame expression of eGFP. However, the vector uses lox2272 sites for the receptor-eGFP cassette, and the SOX10-Cre mice express wild-type Cre, which cannot cut lox2272 sites. As a result, the stop cassette remains intact, preventing eGFP expression. This explains the absence of the green signal, as the eGFP is not expressed due to the stop cassette not being removed.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame because the stop cassette between them (using lox2272 sites) cannot be removed by the wild-type Cre from the SOX10-Cre mice. This prevents eGFP expression, leading to no fluorescence in the confocal microscopy.

Answer: D
