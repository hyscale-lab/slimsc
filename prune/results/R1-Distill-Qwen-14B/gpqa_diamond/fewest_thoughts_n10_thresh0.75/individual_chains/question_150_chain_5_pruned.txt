Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's take a deep breath and tackle it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through.

The compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so let's see. The molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So substituting, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 - 9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5 degrees of unsaturation. Five degrees could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. Like maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds and a ring, so 4 degrees) and then maybe a carbonyl group (another double bond, that's 5). So a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group would fit.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's break that down.

The 1H-NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. High upfield, maybe a carbonyl adjacent proton, like an aldehyde? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a triplet? Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could it be an enol proton or something else? Or maybe an aldehyde with neighboring protons.

Wait, the triplet integration is 1H. So only one proton as a triplet. Aldehyde protons are typically singlets, unless there's coupling. Maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone, but that's usually lower. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated system, like an enal (an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde). The aldehyde proton could couple with two protons on the adjacent carbon, making a triplet.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region. A doublet with two protons. Maybe part of a di-substituted benzene ring.

Then 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Another doublet, also two protons. These could be the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene. Wait, so perhaps two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. The first at 6.98 and the second at 6.51. That sounds like a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each causing deshielding. Or maybe it's a di-substituted ring, like two substituents in para positions.

Then 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, two protons. Maybe some aromatic protons that are not in a symmetrical position. Or maybe they're adjacent to an electrondonating group, like an -OH.

Wait, but wait, the 'bs' stands for broad singlet. Broad suggests that they might be exchanging protons, like in an -OH group. But wait, the integration is 2H. So perhaps two hydroxyl protons? But that's unlikely because hydroxyls usually show up as broad singlets but maybe split into other patterns. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like allylic protons or something else.

Then 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet, integrating to 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to something else, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. Or a CH2 connected to an oxygen, such as in a glycol or something similar. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton group, maybe another CH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure involves a benzene ring connected to a chain that includes an aldehyde group and some oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation again. Five degrees. So one ring (from benzene) is four, plus a double bond (like an aldehyde group, which is a double bond). So the molecular structure is likely a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Looking at the reagents used. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 and HCl: That's usually for diazotization. So the compound probably has a substituent that can be diazotized, like an aromatic amine (but wait, the formula has N and O; the substituent might be an amino group which can be converted to a diazonium salt).

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So N is present as an amine group
