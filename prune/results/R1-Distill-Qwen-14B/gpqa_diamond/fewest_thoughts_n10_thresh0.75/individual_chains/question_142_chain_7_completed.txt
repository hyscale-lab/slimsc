Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the density matrix for a completely mixed state in a qubit. 

Wait, but how does this translate to the geometrical position? I think about the Bloch sphere. Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented on a Bloch sphere. The density matrix for a pure state would be a vector pointing from the origin to the surface of the sphere. But since this is a mixed state, the representation is different. 

I remember that the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3-dimensional vector. So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me compute the given ρ. The matrix |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

So plugging into the general formula: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I: 0 = r·σ. Hmm, so r·σ must be the zero matrix. 

What does r·σ mean? The dot product of the vector r with the Pauli matrices. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this to be zero, each component must be zero. Because if you have a sum of matrices multiplied by coefficients equaling zero, each coefficient must be zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but what does that point represent? Oh, right, the origin. So the density matrix is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state. There's no direction, so it's like the average of all possible states.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that's the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a 3-dimensional vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). For this to hold, all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero: \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This makes sense because the density matrix represents a completely mixed state, with no preferential direction.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
