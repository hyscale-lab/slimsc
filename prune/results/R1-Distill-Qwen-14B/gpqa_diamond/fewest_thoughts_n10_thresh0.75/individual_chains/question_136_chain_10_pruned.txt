Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out from a point.

Wait, the field is radial and falls off as 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, that would mean f(r) is along the r-hat direction, right? So f(r) = (1/r²) r-hat. Because only the radial component is non-zero, the other components (like theta and phi) are zero.

I need to find the divergence of this field. Oh right, the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Let me think. Divergence of a vector field A is (1/(r²)) [ d(r² A_r) / dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ r)) dA_phi/dphi ].

In this case, since the field only has A_r, the other terms are zero. So divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² A_r)/ dr. Here, A_r is 1/r². Let me plug that in.

So, A_r = 1/r². Then r² A_r would be r²*(1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Oh wait, so divergence of f(r) is (1/r²) * 0 = 0. That's interesting. So the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin?

But wait, what about the origin? The field is singular at r=0 because as r approaches zero, the field blows up. So the divergence being zero suggests that the field is solenoidal (no sources or sinks) except possibly at the origin.

Now the integral in question is the volume integral of divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So the integral of ∇·f dV over the volume. If ∇·f is zero everywhere except at a point, then the integral should be zero? Or maybe I'm missing something about Gauss's law here.

Wait, Gauss's law in differential form states that the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, but here, if the divergence is zero, then the integral
