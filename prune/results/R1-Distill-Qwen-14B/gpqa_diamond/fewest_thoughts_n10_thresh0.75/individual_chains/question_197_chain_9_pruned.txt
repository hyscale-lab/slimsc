Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I have to identify the final product. The options are A to D, each an organic compound.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X. There's IR and 1H NMR data.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm, I remember that IR peaks can tell us about functional groups.

The broad peak between 3400–2500 cm-1 is probably from an O-H stretch. Wait, but wait, the region is 3400 to 2500. That might be an OH or maybe an NH stretch, but the peak is broad. O-H stretching is usually around 3000-3500 cm-1, but a broad peak could also indicate an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the presence of a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1725 cm-1, and the O-H would be very broad, maybe around 2500-3300. But wait, in the IR data, the 3400-2500 is a broad peak, which could be an O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone, but the 3400 region might also suggest an alcohol. Hmm, but the 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Let me hold onto that thought.

Looking at the NMR now. The 1H NMR data is as follows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.
