Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the allowed decay channels for this boson X. Let's start by understanding the problem. The given Lagrangian is for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I need to parse that correctly. Oh right, it's probably the Yukawa interaction term. The general form of Yukawa coupling is something like L = -g ψ̄ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So in this case, it looks like the coupling involves the field X and the fermion fields ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So we need to determine what fermions it can decay into. The possible decay products would be pairs of fermions and their corresponding antiparticles. The key here is to find which fermion-antifermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X, which is 6 GeV.

Let me list out all the possible fermions and their masses. Wait, but which fermions are considered here? The problem statement says that the interaction is with fermions, so I should consider all the quarks and leptons.

Quarks come in different flavors: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But their masses are important here because the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV for each pair.

Leptons include electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. But neutrinos are massless (or have very tiny masses), so the tau, mu, and electron pairs would need to be considered.

Wait, but for the decay X → f f̄, the sum of the masses of f and f̄ must be less than or equal to the X mass. So for each fermion, 2 * m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me list the approximate masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark: around 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV)
- Down quark: similar to up, about 4 MeV (0.004 GeV)
- Strange quark: around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
