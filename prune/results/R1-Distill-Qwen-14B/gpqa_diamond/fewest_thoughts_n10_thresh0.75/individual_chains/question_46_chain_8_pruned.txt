Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me recall what Grubbs catalyst does. I think Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Oh right, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium-based, and it facilitates ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. It's especially good for breaking and remaking double bonds in a controlled way.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers, right? So the molecule has a stereocenter. Let me draw its structure. The pent-1-ene part means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pentene has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the third carbon from the left. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So if it's 3-methyl, then on the third carbon (the CH2 in pent-1-ene), there's a methyl branch. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be six carbons. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, pent- means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons in a row. Let me count: 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)-), 4 (CH2-), 5 (CH3). No, that's six carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the
