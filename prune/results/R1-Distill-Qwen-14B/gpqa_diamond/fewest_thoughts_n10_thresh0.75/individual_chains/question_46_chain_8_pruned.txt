Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Hmm, I should probably start by recalling what metathesis does.

Metathesis is a process where the catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, the double bond breaks and reforms in a way that swaps the substituents. Grubbs catalyst is typically used for ring-closing metathesis, but also for ring-opening and cross metathesis. In this case, since the starting material is an alkene, I think it's about the possible products when the double bond rearranges.

The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would make it CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, so 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, no, pent has five carbons. So 3-methyl pent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Oh no, wait, wait. Let me count.

Wait, pent is five carbons. So 3-methyl pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the five carbons are arranged as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So for 3-methyl pent-1-ene, the third carbon (the CH2 in CH2=CH-CH
