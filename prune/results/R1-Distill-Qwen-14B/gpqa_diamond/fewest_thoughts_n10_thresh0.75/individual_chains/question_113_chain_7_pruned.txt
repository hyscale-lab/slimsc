Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me see what I can remember from my classes.

So, the question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. I know that FTIR is great for identifying functional groups based on their characteristic absorption peaks. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks in that region are usually from either alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch tends to be even broader, maybe? Or maybe a very strong and broad peak. Also, another strong peak at 1700 cm^-1—that's a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. And there's another strong peak at 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is usually for a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be from conjugated carbonyl groups, like an ester or maybe an amide. Wait, but amides have different IR regions... Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a benzene ring with substituents. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at 1650, perhaps it's an ester? Because esters show two strong peaks around 1700 and 1650 due to the C=O and C-O stretching. Or maybe it's a ketone plus some conjugated double bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The two strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. That sounds like an ester, where the carbonyl (C=O) is around 1700, and the C-O stretch in the ester group is around 1650. Or maybe an aromatic ester or something with conjugation. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone with an adjacent double bond, but then the 1650 could be a C=C. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are H's attached to a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So, that suggests there's a double bond in the molecule.

The NMR part says there are several peaks including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound has a double bond—maybe an alkene. So if there's a carbonyl and a double bond, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond nearby. Or maybe a ketone with a double bond, but the IR 1700 is more likely a carbonyl in an ester or ketone. Also, considering the O-H peak in IR, maybe there's an alcohol group as well? Or maybe the O-H is part of a carbonyl, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H peak, and
