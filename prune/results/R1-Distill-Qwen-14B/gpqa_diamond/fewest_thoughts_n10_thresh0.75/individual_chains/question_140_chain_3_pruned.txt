Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So that's just above freezing, but not by much. Then, there's something about a product of a keto acid reacting with X containing 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

I remember that in reactions, violent reactions often involve things like acid-base reactions, possibly with metals. The gas W with equal protons and neutrons... Hmm, let's think about possible gases. Wait, water is H2O, but that's not a gas in this context. Oh, wait, maybe H2, but H2 has one proton and one neutron each, so total protons and neutrons in the molecule would be 2 each. No, wait, the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, each molecule. So for example, H2O has 2 H's (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So the molecule has 2+8=10 protons, and 0 +8=8 neutrons. Not same. So that's not it.

Another possibility: NH3? No, that's a liquid sometimes. Or maybe CO2, but that's a gas but let's see. CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O's (8 each). So for the molecule: 6 + 2*8=22 protons, 6 + 2*8=22 neutrons. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So gas W could be CO2. Or wait, maybe another option.

Wait, another thought: if the gas is something like CH4, but that has 4 H's and 1 C. Protons: 4 +6=10. Neutrons: 6 (C has
