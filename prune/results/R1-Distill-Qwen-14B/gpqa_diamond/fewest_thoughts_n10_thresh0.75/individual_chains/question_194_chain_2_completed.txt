Okay, so I have this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, each spin can be either +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Right, so the system can be in eight different configurations.

The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Wait, J is a coupling constant, I think. And beta is 1/(kT), which is the inverse temperature scaled by Boltzmann's constant. The partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E), right?

So first, I need to find all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and compute E for each, then sum exp(-beta E) over all these.

Let me list all 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now I need to compute E for each of these.

Let's compute E for each state:

Each term in the energy is S_i S_j.

So for each state, compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let's go one by one.

1. All +1:
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J

2. S3=-1:
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: 1-1-1= -1. E = -J*(-1) = J

3. S2=-1, others +1:
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J

4. S2=-1, S3=-1:
S1S2 = 1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3= (-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J

5. S1=-1, others +1:
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: -1-1+1 = -1. E= J

6. S1=-1, S3=-1:
S1S2= (-1)*1=-1
S1S3= (-1)*(-1)=1
S2S3= 1*(-1)=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1
S1S3= (-1)*1=-1
S2S3= (-1)*1=-1
Sum: 1-1-1 = -1. E= J

8. All -1:
S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1
Similarly, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.
E = -J*3 = -3J

Wait, so let's list the E values:

1. -3J
2. J
3. J
4. J
5. J
6. J
7. J
8. -3J

So how many states have E = -3J? Only two: first and last states. Each has energy -3J.

All the other six states have E = J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over each state's Boltzmann factor. So:

Z = sum_{each state} exp(-beta E)

So for states 1 and 8: exp(-beta * (-3J)) = exp(3J beta), each contributes this. So two times e^{3J beta}.

For the other six states: each contributes exp(-beta * J) = e^{-J beta}, and there are six of them. So 6 e^{-J beta}.

So Z = 2 e^{3J beta} + 6 e^{-J beta}.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B is Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ), which matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the energy terms.

Wait, E = -J (sum of S_i S_j). So when the sum is 3, E is -3J. So for states 1 and 8, E is -3J.

When the sum is -1, E is J.

Wait, that's right. So each of the six other states has E = J.

So when I calculate the Boltzmann factor for each state, for the two states with E=-3J, their contribution is e^{-beta*(-3J)}=e^{3J beta} each. So two of them: 2 e^{3J beta}.

For the six states with E=J, each contributes e^{-beta*J} and there are six, so 6 e^{-J beta}.

So Z = 2 e^{3J beta} + 6 e^{-J beta}.

Looking at the options, option B is "Z=2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)", so that's option B.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option A is 2 e^{-3J} +6 e^{J}, which would be if E was positive when the sum is 3. But in our case, E is negative. So A is not correct.

Options C and D have exponents of 2J and -2J, which doesn't fit. Because our states are either -3J or J, so the exponents are 3Jβ and -Jβ.

So yes, the correct answer is option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by noting that the total number of possible states is \( 2^3 = 8 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right),
\]

where \( J \) is the coupling constant. The partition function \( Z \) is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E),
\]

where \( \beta = 1 / (kT) \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all states and compute \( E \)
Each spin configuration corresponds to a unique state. There are 8 states in total, and their energies are computed as follows:

1. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

2. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

3. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

4. \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

5. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

6. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

7. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

8. \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \):  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).

### Step 2: Compute \( Z \)
The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} \exp(-\beta E).
\]

From the computed energies:
- Two states have \( E = -3J \), each contributing \( \exp(-\beta (-3J)) = \exp(3J\beta) \). Together, they contribute \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \).
- Six states have \( E = J \), each contributing \( \exp(-\beta J) \). Together, they contribute \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**Option B: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).**

Answer: B
