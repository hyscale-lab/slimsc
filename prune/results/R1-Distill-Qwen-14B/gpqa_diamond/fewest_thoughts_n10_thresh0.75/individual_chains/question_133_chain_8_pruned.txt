Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Their molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C. I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, what's orthophosphate again? Oh right, PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion. But in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH—like H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So I need to consider the dissolution and equilibria of these species.

The question also gives the Ka values for H3PO4. Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Oh right, these are the dissociation constants. So at each step, H3PO4 loses a proton.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

So, in the solution, I have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. These are conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept one to go back to H2PO4^-.

Since both H2PO
