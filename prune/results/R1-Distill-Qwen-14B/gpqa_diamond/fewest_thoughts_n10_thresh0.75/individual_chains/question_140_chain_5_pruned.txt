Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I think is around 4°C because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. So B must be a solid at that temperature, maybe something like ice or another crystalline solid.

Then there's another clue: the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. The product would probably be a salt or something, but I'm not exactly sure. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's noted that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Hmm. 

Let me try to break this down. 

First, the reaction between X and Y. Let me think about possible violent reactions between substances. One possibility is a reaction between a metal and an acid, like magnesium and hydrochloric acid, but that's not a violent reaction. Wait, maybe it's a reaction between a metal and water, but that's more for metals like potassium or sodium. Another thought: perhaps it's a reaction between a carbonate and an acid? Or maybe something involving a strong base.

Wait, the gas W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. So the molecule's composition would have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let me think about that. For example, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and an O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope). So the total protons would be 2 +8=10, and neutrons would be 2*(0 for H, wait no, H has 1 neutron in H2O? Wait, H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons (if it's H1). So O has 8 neutrons, H's have none. So total neutrons would be 8. But protons would be 2*1 +8 =10. So 10 and 8, not equal. So that's not it.

Another possibility is CO2. CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (8 each). So molecule: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, that's equal. So W could be CO2. But wait, is CO2 a gas produced in such reactions? Maybe when a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get CO2 gas. But the reaction with X and Y produces gas W. Alternatively, maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility: H2O. But as I thought earlier, the protons and neutrons don't match. Hmm.

Wait, what about CH4?
