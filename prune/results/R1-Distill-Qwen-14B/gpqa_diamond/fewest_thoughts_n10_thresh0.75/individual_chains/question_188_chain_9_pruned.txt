Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember from my solid state physics class that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no, wait! In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with a = b = c, and angles all 30 degrees. Hmm. 

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using something called the Bragg's law, but wait, no, Bragg's law is for diffraction. Oh right, the interplanar distance d is given by the formula involving the reciprocal lattice vectors or the Miller indices. Oh, the formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) ) ) ), but wait, wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) ), but wait, no, I'm getting the angles mixed up. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles are between the axes, so maybe I should double-check the exact formula.

Alternatively,
