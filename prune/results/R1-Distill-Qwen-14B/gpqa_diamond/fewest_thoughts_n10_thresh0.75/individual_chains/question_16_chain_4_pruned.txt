Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various compounds. I'm a bit rusty on stereochemistry, but I'll try to work through each compound step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. I remember that a compound is optically active if it has a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like an axial chirality or allene-type chirality. So I'll go one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Let me draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Chlorine is on C1, and a methyl is on C2. The substituents around the double bond are: on C1, Cl and maybe a hydrogen (since but-1-ene is CH2CH2... wait, but for but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait butene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but the double bond is between 1 and 2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl replacing a H on C1, and 2-methyl would be a CH3 on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3; thus, 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So the structure is ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but no, wait, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3
