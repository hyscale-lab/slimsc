Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they're looking at the target gene sequences. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene's sequence is provided, and four mutants are listed. I need to figure out which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby reducing or eliminating the compound.

Hmm, I remember that to disrupt a gene's function, you usually want to disrupt the coding sequence so that the protein isn't made correctly. That could be done by introducing a frameshift or a premature stop codon. Alternatively, a missense mutation might change a critical amino acid. But let's look at each mutant.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So the beginning is ATG, which is the start codon, followed by TTT, which is Phe. Then CTC, which is Leu, etc.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, let's see where the changes are. The first few codons: Intact is ATGTTTCTC... So the first three nucleotides after ATG are TTT. In Mutant 1, it's TTCTACG... Wait, let's break it down.

Wait, maybe I should look at each codon. Let's see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so the first few codons are changing. Let me write the codons properly.

Intact:
ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
... etc.

Mutant 1:
ATG (same)
TTC (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
... etc.

So the first codon after ATG in intact is TTT (Phe), and in Mutant 1, it's TTC (also Phe). So that's a silent mutation; no change in amino acid.

Then, the next codon in the intact is CTC (Leu). In Mutant 1, it's TAC.
