Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that exons are the parts of the gene that code for proteins, and introns are the non-coding parts that get spliced out. The question is about a gene with five exons and four introns.

The issue is that there's this anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, and the gene responsible for it has been identified. So the goal is to eliminate this compound, probably by disrupting the gene. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think causes point mutations, usually by adding methyl groups to DNA, leading to base changes.

Looking at the sequences given, the intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there are some codons, and it ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Each mutant has a change in the first exon area.

I need to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That likely means disrupting the gene's function. So, a mutation that causes a premature stop codon would probably do that. Alternatively, a frameshift could also disrupt the protein, but looking at the sequences, I don't see any insertions or deletions—just substitutions. So maybe a nonsense mutation (leading to a stop codon) or a missense (changing an amino acid, maybe making the protein nonfunctional) could be the key.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence:

Intact gene:
5’-ATG TTT CTG GCT GGA CTT CTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA TGC TGT CG… TGA-3’

Wait, I think I should break this into codons. Let me see:

ATG is methionine (start).
Then TTT is phenylalanine.
CTG is leucine.
GCT is alanine.
GGA is glycine.
CTT is leucine.
CTG is leucine.
TGG is tryptophan.
ATG is methionine.
AAC is asparagine.
ATA is isoleucine.
TTA is leucine.
TGC is cysteine.
TGT is cysteine.
CG… Hmm, not sure about the rest, but the key is stopping at TGA.

Now, the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTCTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCG C… TGA-3’

Wait, no. Let me look again. The intact gene and the mutants are shown as longer sequences. Let me compare each mutant's initial part.

Mutant 1: The sequence after ATG is TTT CTG GCT GGA CTT CTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA TGC TGT CG... ?

Wait, no, the way the problem is written, each mutant's sequence is given starting from ATG, with some changes. Let me parse the changes.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for where the mutations are. Each mutant starts with a change in the first exon, so perhaps in the first few codons.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The original first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant 1's sequence is ATG
