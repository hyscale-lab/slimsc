Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, right? Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, but I think they use a different approach for acceleration. Let me try to recall the details.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Oh, maybe it means that the proton is accelerated twice in some way? Or perhaps it's accelerated over two different cycles? I'm not sure yet.

The question is about the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The given voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV.

I remember that in a cyclotron, the particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key idea is that the frequency of the electric field must match the natural cyclotron frequency of the particle to efficiently accelerate it. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, does this change? Oh right, synchrocyclotrons use a varying magnetic field to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the frequency of the accelerating electric field as the particle's mass increases due to higher velocities.

But wait, the problem gives me an acceleration voltage that's a function of time with a cosine. The voltage is varying, but I think the frequency ν here is the same as the cyclotron frequency, which changes as the proton's speed increases. Or maybe not? I'm a bit confused.

Let me think about the process. The proton starts with negligible KE, so its initial velocity is almost zero. As it gets accelerated by the electric field, its velocity increases, which in a regular cyclotron would require the frequency of the electric field to adjust. But since synchrocyclotrons vary the magnetic field instead, the cyclotron frequency ν is kept in sync with the electric field frequency.

Wait, the cyclotron frequency is given by ν = (qB)/(2πm). But in a synchrocyclotron, B is time-dependent because it's being adjusted to keep ν constant as the particle's velocity increases. So the particle's kinetic energy increases
