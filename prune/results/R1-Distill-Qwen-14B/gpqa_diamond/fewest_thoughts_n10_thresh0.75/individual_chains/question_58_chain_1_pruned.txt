Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make the math manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities before they're canceled out or renormalized.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never needs regularization. So which of these theories is free from such issues even at high energies?

I think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it's a candidate for a theory that unifies all forces. Because it's a theory that includes gravity, maybe it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories? Or does it? Wait, I'm not too sure. I think superstring theory doesn't require renormalization because the theory is finite. So maybe it doesn't need regularization either. But I'm not 100% certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning quarks behave as almost free particles at high energies. But because of this, the theory is perturbatively manageable. Wait, but does it need regularization? I think QCD does require regularization, especially when dealing with things like the beta function and running coupling. Or maybe because it's a non-Abelian gauge theory, there are divergences that need to be handled. So regularization is probably needed here.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED does require renormalization because of the divergent loop diagrams. For example, electron mass and charge get corrected, leading to infinities. So regularization is a part of doing calculations in QED to handle these divergences before renormalizing. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. Classical ED doesn't deal with quantum divergences because it's not a quantum theory. So in classical ED, you don't have things like infinite charge densities or other infinities that quantum theories run into. So
