Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are basically infinities that pop up in calculations and don't make physical sense. Regularization helps to make these infinities manageable so that you can renormalize the theory, meaning you can get finite, meaningful results.

So, the question is about which theory doesn't need regularization when dealing with high energies. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, superstring theory is a type of string theory, right? String theories try to describe particles as tiny vibrating strings. I think they're quantum theories, so they probably deal with similar issues as other quantum field theories. But wait, wait! String theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. Oh, but I recall that string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as, say, quantum electrodynamics or chromodynamics. Or does it? Or maybe it's because string theory has a sort of "built-in" regularization due to the strings themselves. Hmm, not entirely sure. I need to think more.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD does require regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams (like in perturbation theory), you get divergences. These divergences are handled through a process called renormalization. So B is not the correct answer because it does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory that describes electromagnetism, electrons, and photons. I remember that QED does have divergent loop diagrams, especially in calculations like the electron self-energy. These divergences are handled with regularization methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc., followed by renormalization. So C also requires regularization, so it's not the correct answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, right? So classical electrodynamics is just Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force. In classical physics, especially at the level of
