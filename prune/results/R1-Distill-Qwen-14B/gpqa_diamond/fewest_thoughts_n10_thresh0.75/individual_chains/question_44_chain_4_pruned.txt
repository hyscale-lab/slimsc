Okay, so I've got this question about a new anti-diabetes drug and how it affects mitochondria in cells. The question is asking which experiment won't help determine the mitochondrial role of the drug. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand each option and what each experiment is testing. The key here is to figure out which one doesn't involve mitochondria in its process. 

The question's setup says that the drug's effect on mitochondria is being tested in HEK293 cells. So the experiments should be looking at mitochondrial function or presence.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit. Wait, differential centrifugation is a method to isolate organelles. Mitochondria are heavy, so they pellet at certain speeds. If you extract mitochondria and then do a glucose uptake assay, I think that's about how well the mitochondria are taking up glucose. But wait, isn't glucose uptake typically a glycolytic process in the cytoplasm, not mitochondrial? Unless the assay is specifically looking at how mitochondria utilize glucose. Hmm, maybe this is looking at mitochondrial function if the assay measures something like glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation indirectly. Or perhaps the mitochondria aren't the main site for glucose uptake. I'm not too sure here. Maybe I should think more.

Option B: Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after adding luciferin. I remember that luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays, like firefly luciferase. When you add luciferin, it emits light if luciferase is active. But in this case, the cells are transformed with recombinant luciferase. Wait, does that mean the cells are expressing a reporter gene? Or is it a separate assay? Oh wait, maybe they're using this for measuring ATP levels. Because luciferase reaction requires ATP to produce light. So if the drug affects mitochondrial function, which is a major site of ATP production, then the luciferase assay would change. So this experiment would indicate if the drug affects ATP levels, thus mitochondrial function. So this would help in determining mitochondrial role. So option B would be a helpful experiment, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Flow cytometry after labeling with 5,5',6,6
