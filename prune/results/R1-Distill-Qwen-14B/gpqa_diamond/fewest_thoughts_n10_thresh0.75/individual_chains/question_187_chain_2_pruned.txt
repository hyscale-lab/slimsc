Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable based on certain criteria. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

First, the question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of the listed stars meet this condition.

I remember that the detectability of a star depends on its brightness, which is measured by its magnitude. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. But wait, magnitude can be a bit tricky because it's on a logarithmic scale. Each step of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in brightness. So a star of magnitude 0 is 100 times brighter than one of magnitude 5.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. From what I recall, ESPRESSO's performance is influenced by the brightness of the star. The fainter the star, the longer the exposure time needed to reach a sufficient S/N. But since the exposure time here is fixed at 1 hour, we need to see if the stars are bright enough for that time.

I think the key here is the V magnitude. The problem gives each star's absolute V magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 parsecs. But their actual apparent magnitude depends on their distance from us. Because apparent magnitude is what determines how bright the star appears from Earth, which directly affects the S/N.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude. The formula for the difference in magnitude is m - M = 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and m is apparent magnitude.

Let's do each star one by one.

Option a) Canopus: I recall Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.72. Since it's way below zero, it's extremely bright. So for ESPRESSO, which needs a high S/N, this star should be easily detectable. But wait, I should check the exposure time. Since it's so bright, the S/N would be way over 10 in 1 hour. So a) is detectable.

Option b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star. I think it's a bit dimmer, maybe around 1.8 to 2.0 in apparent magnitude. Let me double-check that. Oh yes, I think it's about 1.97. So m around 2. So not as bright as Canopus. But still, with a 1-hour exposure, would the S/N be >=10? I'm not sure, but I think Polaris is bright enough. Let's keep this in mind and check later.

Options c, d, e, f: All these stars have absolute V magnitude of 15, but different distances. So I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes.

c) Distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is defined at 10
