Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to take it slow and see if I can figure it out.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some experiments with knockout mutants and double mutants. The data given is about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type, which is 100% resistant.

So the setup is that they knocked out three genes: G1, G2, and G3. Then they made double mutants by combining each pair. The results are:

- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0% (so no resistance, very susceptible)
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% (super susceptible)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, so each number is the percentage of resistance compared to the control (wild-type). So 0% means they're completely susceptible, right?

The question asks what conclusion can be drawn about the interactions among these genes. The options are A to D, each giving a different scenario.

First, I need to remember some basic concepts. Transcription factors are proteins that help turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. If a transcription factor is knocked out (like in g2), the genes it regulates won't be expressed. That could mean that G2 is acting upstream of other genes.

Then there's something about epistasis and pleiotropy. Epistasis is when the expression of one gene affects the expression of another gene. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, A's product might be necessary for B's product to function. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Also, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

Looking at the data:

g2 has 0% resistance. That's the most severe. The double mutants involving g2 also have 0% resistance. So when both G2 and another gene are knocked out, the resistance is still 0%. Hmm.

g1 has 75%—so it's somewhat compromised but not as bad as g2. g3 has 50%, which is worse than g1 but not as bad as g2.

Let's look at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10%. That's much worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So when both g1 and g3 are out, resistance plummets.

g2g3: 0%—same as g2 alone.

g1g2: 0%—same as g2 alone.

Wait, so when any of the double mutants include g2, the resistance is 0%. That suggests that g2 is a major player here. So perhaps g2 is upstream of the others.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then without G2, none of the downstream genes can be expressed. So maybe G2 is the master regulator. Let's think about that. If G2 is upstream, then knocking it out would disable all the genes it controls, leading to the most severe phenotype.

Looking at the options, all options except B and maybe A have G2 as the transcription factor. Option B says G2 is a TF, which I think is likely.

Wait, option A says G1 is a transcription factor, but our data suggests G2 is more critical because the g2 mutant is completely susceptible. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor.

So G2 is a transcription factor. Let's proceed with that.

Now, the other genes, G1 and G3—what's their relationship?

Looking at the single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance, g3
