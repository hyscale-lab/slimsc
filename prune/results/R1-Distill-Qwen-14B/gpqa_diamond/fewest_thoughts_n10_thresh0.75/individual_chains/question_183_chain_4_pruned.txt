Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents used are red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, what's that reaction about?

Wait, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of certain groups. Oh right, it's the reaction where an acid anhydride or something similar reacts. But wait, in this case, the compound is a cyclohexene ring with substituents. Let me think about the structure.

The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring (so a six-membered ring with one double bond) has a formyl group (CHO) at position 2, a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so at position 5, and the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or wait, wait, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me draw this mentally.

The main ring is cyclohexene, which has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). So positions 3 and 4 are double-bonded. Then,
