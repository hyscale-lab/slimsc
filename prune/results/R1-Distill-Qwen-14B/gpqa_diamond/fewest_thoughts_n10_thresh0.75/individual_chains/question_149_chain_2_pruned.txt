Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows something unusual. The NMR spectrum looks as expected except for two peaks that are from the same alpha-proton. So, same alpha proton gives two peaks. They have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. That suggests that it's not a splitting due to coupling because they're integrating to the same amount as a single proton would. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so it's not that. Hmm.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. The crude compound when analyzed shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So the mass is correct, but there are two peaks. So same mass but different something else.

What could cause two peaks in the same mass? They would have the same molecular weight, so maybe they are isomers or something else.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The MS would show the precursor's mass. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So this might not fit. Unless the precursor also has same mass, but that's unlikely. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have same molecular weight and same NMR shifts except in chiral environments. Wait, but if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR might show same shifts? Because in a racemic mixture, the peaks would average out. But in the NMR here, the two peaks have similar shifts. Wait, in an enantiomer, if the alpha protons are the same, their chemical shifts would be same, so a racemic mixture wouldn't split into two peaks in NMR because they are identical. Hmm, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, if the sample is chiral and has some diastereomers, but no, enantiomers wouldn't cause different shifts. Wait, no, enantiomers would have same shifts in an achiral environment but in a chiral environment, like when the sample is enriched in one enantiomer, perhaps? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Option C
