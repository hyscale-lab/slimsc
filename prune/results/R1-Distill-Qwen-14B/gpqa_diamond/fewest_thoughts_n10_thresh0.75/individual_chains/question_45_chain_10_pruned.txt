Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each particle's energy is given as E_n = (n² * pi² * ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And the problem defines E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² * E. That makes things simpler.

Wait, but wait. The particles here are identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, so they're fermions, and they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold at most one particle. So I need to figure out how the particles fill up the energy levels considering their spin.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum number n determines the energy. For each n, there's two possible spin states (up and down) because the spin is 1/2. So each energy level can hold two particles—one for each spin state.

The question is about the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Let's think about each.

Starting with the ground state. Ground state means the lowest possible energy configuration. Since each particle is spin-1/2, each energy level can take two particles. So, for four particles, how do they fill the levels?

The first level (n=1) can hold two particles. The second level (n=2) can hold two more. So all four particles would be in n=1 and n=2 levels, each filled with two particles. So the ground state energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. Each particle in n=1 has energy 1² E = E. Two of them, so 2E. Similarly, each in n=2 has 4E, two particles make 8E. So total ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, but looking at the options, option B has a ground state of 4E. Wait, that doesn't match. Did I get something wrong?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. The problem says four particles in the system, but perhaps each is placed in the well, but the well is for indistinguishable particles. Wait, no, the particles are identical, so their
