Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says it's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is one of those. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Since the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is CaY^2- maybe? Because EDTA is often Y^4- when it's deprotonated enough. But wait, the pH is ideal, so maybe all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca.

I think the formation constant K is given for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or something similar). The K here would be the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So given K is 5e10, and the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the [CaEDTA^2-].

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. We can assume that the complex doesn't dissociate much because K is large, so the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be low.

So let me set up the variables. Let [Ca²+] be x. Then [EDTA^4-] would be y. But wait, considering the stoichiometry of the reaction, for every mole of Ca²+ that reacts, it forms one mole of the complex. So if the complex is 0.02 M, then the sum of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would relate somehow.

Wait, no, I think a better approach is to consider that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But the complex is 1:1, so [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. So the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is given as 5e10, so the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have a K_dissociation = 1 / K = 2e-11.

So we can write the expression
