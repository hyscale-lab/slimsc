Okay, let's see. I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which I think might not affect it much since it's a standard condition. Oh, and the formation constant KCa-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I guess is the complex ion, maybe like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part. So the concentration given is 0.02 M of this complex.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Because when EDTA complexes with Ca²+, it's taking the Ca²+ out of the solution as part of the complex. So the free Ca²+ concentration would be very low, right? Because the formation constant is large, which means the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

The formula for the formation constant, K, for a complex like CaY²− would be K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, I think the formation constant is also sometimes written as Kf, the formation constant, which is equal to [ML]/
