Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think through them as I go.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm, so first, I should probably recall what the fundamental state means here. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to a higher energy state.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. That must mean that both rotational and vibrational energy levels are considered. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond is allowed to stretch slightly, unlike the rigid rotor model where the bond length is fixed. So the molecule has both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm thinking, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can undergo a transition either by changing the vibrational state, the rotational state, or both. But which transition leads to the next lowest state?

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2...). The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number (J=0,1,2...) and B is the rotational constant.

The total energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational contributions. So, the fundamental state is when both v and J are at their lowest. The lowest vibrational state is v=0, and the lowest rotational state is J=0. So the fundamental state is the combination of v=0 and J=0.

But wait, maybe the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state, regardless of rotation. Or perhaps the question is considering the molecule as being in the ground vibrational state but with some rotational energy. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the model is treating it as a rigid rotor, but the problem says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm. Wait, but the non-rigid rotor model might also include vibrational modes, so the molecule's bond length can change slightly, affecting the rotational energy.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The problem is about a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would likely be the next higher energy state, which would involve either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state.

But for the lowest energy transition, which requires the least energy? Because photons have energy E = hf, so the momentum p is related to energy via E = p²/(2m), but wait, photons don't have mass, so their momentum is p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, but maybe that's getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the allowed transitions. In vibrational transitions, the selection rule is
