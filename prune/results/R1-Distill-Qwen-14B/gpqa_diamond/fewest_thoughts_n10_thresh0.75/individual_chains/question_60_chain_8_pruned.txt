Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to work through it. The question is about time dilation in space travel, right? So, it's a scenario where an alien astronaut is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth in a super-fast spacecraft. The speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really fast. That's like almost the speed of light. So, I think this involves special relativity because we're dealing with speeds that are a significant fraction of c.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is about 150 solar years. The question is asking how long the trip would take from the astronaut's perspective. The options are about whether they die before reaching Earth or how many years they live through during the trip.

Wait, I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference—in this case, the astronaut's ship. So, I remember that in special relativity, the time experienced by the traveler is less than the time measured by someone at rest (like someone on Earth). The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Gamma tells us how much time dilation occurs.

But wait, the problem gives the speed as v = 0.99999987c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. So, let me calculate gamma for this speed. Let's compute v²/c² first. v is 0.99999987c, so v squared over c squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so squaring it will give something like 0.99999974. Hmm, but wait, let me be precise. Let's compute (0.99999987)^2. So 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974000009, but for our purposes, we can approximate it as 0.99999974.

So,
