Okay, so I have this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means it's in the lowest energy state possible. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule jumps to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The molecule is made of elements X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. That probably means it considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But when a photon is absorbed, which transition happens? Oh, right, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), and when a photon is absorbed, it could either increase the vibrational energy or the rotational energy. But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, so I think that refers to the next vibrational state, because vibrational energy changes involve higher energy jumps than rotational.

Wait, no, in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one is lower in energy? I remember that the vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational, so the first excited state is probably the first vibrational level, v=1, J=0. Or wait, no, actually the rotational transitions are usually in the microwave and the vibrational in the infrared. So when a photon is absorbed, it might cause a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes, but perhaps the main contribution comes from the vibrational part.

Wait, but the question is about the photon's momentum. The energy of a photon is E = h*w_photon, which is related to its momentum p via E = p^2/(2m_photon), but wait, photons have momentum p = E/c, since for photons E = pc. So, the momentum would be E divided by the speed of light.

Wait, no, the photon's energy is E = h*f, and since f = c/lambda, so E = h c /
