Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's energy state transition when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it needs to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, I should remember the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model. So the molecule's energy states involve both rotational and vibrational levels.

In the fundamental state, I think that's the lowest energy state. To go to the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule would have to undergo a transition where it either changes its vibrational state or rotational state, or both. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, the question specifies that the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the first excited state, which is the next higher energy level. But which transition is allowed? I remember selection rules: for diatomic molecules, the selection rules for vibrational and rotational transitions are usually Δv = ±1 for vibration, and ΔJ = ±1 for rotation.

But wait, in the fundamental state, the vibrational state is v=0, so the next vibrational state is v=1. For rotation, the fundamental state probably has J=0, so the next would
