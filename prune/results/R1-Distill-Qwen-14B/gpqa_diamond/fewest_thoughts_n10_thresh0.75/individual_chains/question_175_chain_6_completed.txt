Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A. We need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ =30 degrees and the possible form of f.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each has a fraction and a dependence on λ.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal with symmetry along z, it's probably similar to a dipole antenna but maybe more symmetric.

Wait, dipole radiation has a specific angular dependence. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far zone (which is where the radiation zone is) is given by a function proportional to (1/(r)) multiplied by sinθ in the θ direction, but perhaps more accurately, the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. But wait, no, that's for a linearly polarized dipole in the far field. The radiation pattern's maximum is along the equator (θ=90 degrees) for a dipole, but in this case, the maximum is along the symmetry axis? Or wait, no, for a dipole, the maximum is perpendicular to the dipole axis. So if the dipole is along the z-axis, the maximum radiation is in the xy-plane, θ=90 degrees.

Wait, but in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. Maybe it's a dipole-like radiation but with a different angular dependence. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to a quadrupole. Or wait, maybe it's a higher multipole. Hmm, but I think that for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is such that the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees.

But wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. So if the maximum occurs at θ=90, then for θ=30 degrees, what's the fraction?

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f depends on θ and λ. The solid angle element is dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ. But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at a specific θ. So perhaps f is proportional to some function of θ, and the maximum occurs at a particular θ.

Wait, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the intensity I ∝ (sin²θ)/(r²), but wait, actually, the intensity is independent of r because intensity is power per unit area, and power goes as 1/r², so I would be 1/(r²) multiplied by the solid angle factor.

Wait, more accurately, in the far field (radiation zone), the electric and magnetic fields decay as 1/r. The intensity (which is the Poynting vector) is proportional to E × H, so it would decay as 1/r². But when considering the power per unit solid angle (which is the same as the intensity, because power is intensity multiplied by solid angle), the angular dependence comes into play.

For a dipole, the radiated power per unit solid angle (the intensity) is given by a function that depends on θ. The formula I think is:

I(θ) = (p² ω⁴ sin²θ)/(12π c³ r²)

Wait, but I might be mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, the radiation pattern is I ∝ sin²θ. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1. So if the maximum power is at θ=90, then at θ=30 degrees, the intensity would be (sin 30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 1/4 of the maximum. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. The question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees". Wait, but that's not precisely correct because the power per unit solid angle is f(θ), which is the intensity. The total power would be the integral of f(θ) over all solid angles, but the maximum value of f is A. So when θ is 30 degrees, the value is f(30) = (some fraction) × A.

Wait, let me think again. The maximum power radiated is A. So A is the maximum value of f(θ). So f(θ) ≤ A.

So the fraction of A at θ=30 is f(30)/A.

So if f(θ) is proportional to sin²θ, then f(30) = sin²(30) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 times A. So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, another possibility is that the maximum is at θ=90, so f(90) = A. Then at θ=30, f(30)= (sin30)^2 * A = (0.25) A. So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, in the problem statement, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So if the maximum of f is A, then yes, when you evaluate at θ=30, it's 0.25 A.

But wait, perhaps the function f is not exactly sin²θ. Maybe it's a different angular dependence. For a dipole, it's sin²θ, but for other multipole moments, it's different. But the problem says it's a spheroid, which I think is a dipole-like distribution.

So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, the other part: what's the possible form of f?

The options are λ^(-4), λ^(-3), λ^(-4), λ^(-6). So looking for the dependence on λ.

In the radiation from a dipole, the power radiated depends on the frequency. The radiated power is proportional to (ω^4) times some constants, and since ω = 2πc/λ, then ω^4 is proportional to λ^(-4). So the function f would have a dependence of λ^(-4).

So putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and the function is λ^(-4). Looking at the options:

Options C is 1/4 and λ^(-4), so that would be the correct option.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: 1/4, λ^(-4). Yes.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^(-4). So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), and the maximum power radiated is \(A\). The goal is to determine the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the possible form of \(f\).

For an oscillating dipole-like charge distribution, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is angularly dependent. The intensity \(f(\theta)\) is proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\), meaning the maximum intensity occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), the fraction of the maximum power radiated is given by:

\[
\frac{f(30^\circ)}{A} = \sin^2(30^\circ) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

Next, the dependence of \(f\) on \(\lambda\) is considered. For a dipole radiator, the radiated power is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\). Since \(\omega^4 \propto \lambda^{-4}\), the function \(f\) has a dependence of \(\lambda^{-4}\).

Combining these results, the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the form of \(f\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\). This matches option **C**.

Answer: C
