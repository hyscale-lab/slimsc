Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But maybe that's not too important for solving the problem. The key points are that there are five planets with circular orbits, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has a period of 1 unit, Planet_2 is 2 units, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, and Planet_5 is 5 units.

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, which means their reflectivity is the same. So, I probably don't have to worry about that factor since it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I might have that wrong. Alternatively, the formula is T = T_effective * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but that's when considering the planet's energy balance.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since these are circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the same as the radius. The formula I'm more confident about is T ∝ (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since the star's luminosity and other factors are the same for all planets, the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the inverse square root of the square root of their orbital distances. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^0.5. So T is proportional to R/(a)^0.5. Wait, no, because it's R over a, and then square rooted. So T ∝ sqrt(R/(a))
