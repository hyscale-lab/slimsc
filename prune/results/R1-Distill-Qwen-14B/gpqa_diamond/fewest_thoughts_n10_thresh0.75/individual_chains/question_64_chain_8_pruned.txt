Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question involves heating a mixture of salts A and B. They say the mixture is equimolar, so same number of moles for A and B. The total mass of the salts is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they produce a mixture of gases. Then these gases are passed through several tubes.

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can absorb water, turning into Mg(ClO4)2·8H2O. So whatever gas goes into this tube, if it's a gas that can release water, like maybe HCl or something else, the Mg(ClO4)2 will trap the water, increasing the tube's weight. The weight increased by 3.60 grams. 

The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Ca(OH)2 is a base; it reacts with acidic gases. If the gas is something like CO2, HCl, etc., it would react. But the weight of the second tube didn't change. Hmm, that suggests that the gases passing through didn't react with the solution. Maybe because they were all neutral or maybe because if they reacted, the solution would gain mass. But since it didn't change, perhaps the gases were non-reactive, like noble gases or maybe N2, CO, etc. Wait, but the first tube's increase suggests that some gas was absorbed, while the second didn't react. 

The third tube is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper is usually involved in reactions with certain gases. For example, CO2 can be reduced to CO with copper, but that's under certain conditions. Or maybe SO3 could react. Wait, but the product formed is CuO. So what would cause CuO to form? Oh, maybe the gas was H2O vapor. Because when water vapor reacts with hot copper, it can produce CuO and H2. Let me think: 2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 4 H2. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that reaction. Alternatively, maybe the gas was something else, but the product is CuO, so maybe the gas was a reducing agent? Or perhaps the gas was steam. 

Wait, the third tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams. So maybe H2O is reacting with copper to form CuO. Because CuO's molar mass is about 80 g/mol. Let me see: The mass of CuO formed is 0.80 grams. Wait, no, no, the tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams. So that would be the mass of H2O consumed? Or the mass of CuO formed? Hmm, wait, the reaction would be:

2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 4 H2 

But in this setup, the copper is in the tube. So the H2O from the gas would react with the Cu to form CuO and H2. The H2 would escape, but the CuO would stay in the tube, increasing its mass. So what's the mass of CuO formed?

The increase in mass is 0.80 grams. Let's calculate the moles of CuO. Molar mass of CuO is 63.55 (Cu) + 16 (O) = 79.55 g/mol. So 0.80 g / 79.55 g/mol ≈ 0.01006 mol. So about 0.01 mol of CuO formed. 

Each mole of CuO comes from one mole
