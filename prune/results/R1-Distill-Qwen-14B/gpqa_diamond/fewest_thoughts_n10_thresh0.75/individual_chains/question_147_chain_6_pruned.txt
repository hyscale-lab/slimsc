Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with different velocities given as fractions of the speed of light c.

Hmm, right. So, the process involves a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Wait, but the question mentions that the antiproton is moving slowly. So, I guess in this scenario, the initial kinetic energy isn't too high compared to the rest mass energies involved.

First, I should think about conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, both energy and momentum should be conserved.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. So, maybe I can approximate that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy, so its velocity is much smaller than c. Hmm, but wait, that might not matter because the problem is about finding the velocity of the A particles.

Wait, perhaps I should model the initial and final states.

Let me think about the initial state. Before the annihilation, we have a proton and an antiproton. Let's denote the proton as p and the antiproton as p̄. Let me assume that the proton is at rest because the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Or wait, the problem says the "antiproton
