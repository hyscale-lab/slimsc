Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some basics about electric and magnetic fields due to moving charges.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're observing at a time t where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. Oh right, so the charge was at some position earlier, and the fields we're seeing now are due to that past position.

I remember that the potentials are related to the fields, and there's this concept of retarded time which comes into play for moving charges. Retarded time because the fields take time to propagate, so what we observe at time t is the effect of the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr.

So for the scalar potential V, I think it's similar to the static case but adjusted for the fact that the charge was moving. Wait, but in the static case, V is just q/(4πε₀ r). But since the charge is moving, does that affect the potential? Wait no, wait. Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just that. Or is it?

Wait, no, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is actually the same as the static case if you consider the charge's position at the retarded time. Because scalar potential is kind of like the electrostatic potential but evaluated at the retarded position. So V(r, t) would involve the charge's position at tr. Hmm, but the options don't seem to have that, except maybe option C and D have terms with d and v.

Wait, the options have different expressions. Let me look at them again.

Option A: V is q/(4πε₀ r), A is v squared over c squared times V. But that seems odd because I thought A depends on the velocity, but would it be v squared?

Option B: V is same as A, and A is v/(c²) V. So A is proportional to velocity. That seems more plausible because the vector potential is related to the magnetic field, which comes from the charge's motion.

Wait, but the potentials are
