Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant, but here it's relativistic, so things are different. Let me think.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. The system has mass m, maximum amplitude A, and obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. The speed of light is c.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which converts to kinetic energy (1/2)mv² at maximum speed. So that's option C, but wait, this is relativistic so that can't be the answer.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are significant compared to the speed of light. So I can't use the non-relativistic formula directly. I need to consider relativistic equations of motion.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is different. The force is F = -kx, but the relativistic mass would be gamma m, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the equation might involve gamma. Let me think about the force equation.

Newton's second law in relativity is F = d(mv)/dt. But v is a function of time, so it's more complicated. Alternatively
