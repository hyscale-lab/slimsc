Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation, but here we have to consider relativity.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(k A²/m). Wait, that's option C. But since this is relativistic, option C might not be the right answer. Relativity usually comes into play with speeds approaching the speed of light, c. So I need to adjust the equations for relativistic effects.

I remember that in relativistic mechanics, the energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, or more accurately, it's the total energy which includes relativistic effects.

The oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx² in the classical case. At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². In the non-relativistic case, all this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0), giving the maximum speed.

But relativity complicates things. The kinetic energy in relativity is given by (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy of the system must be conserved, considering relativistic energy.

Wait, but wait—does the potential energy also change in the relativistic case? Or is the potential still (1/2)kx²? I think the problem states it's obeying Hooke's law, so the potential is likely the same as the classical case. So potential energy is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy is then E = (1/2)kA² + mc² (since at x=A, the KE is zero, and PE is maximum). Wait, no. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², but when considering relativity, maybe the rest energy comes into play. Hmm, maybe I should think about the total energy as the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy?

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But when speeds get relativistic, the kinetic energy increases. So the total energy should be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy plus the potential energy.

Wait, no. The total mechanical energy in a harmonic oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc². Or wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

In the classical case, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², and at that point, the kinetic energy is zero. So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the energy can't just be split into KE and PE like that, perhaps? Or maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², and the kinetic is relativistic.

So when the oscillator is at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, the rest energy is mc², so maybe in relativity, the total energy is higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.

The system is a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The potential energy is given by V(x) = (1/2)
