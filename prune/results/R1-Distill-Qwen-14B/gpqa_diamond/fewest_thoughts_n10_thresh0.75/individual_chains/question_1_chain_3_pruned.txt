Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the maximum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the sum. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy has an uncertainty, so to resolve them, the separation between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Or perhaps it's the uncertainty in their combined system? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should compute the natural linewidth or the energy uncertainty for each. The natural linewidth (ΔE) is given by ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime. So for each state, ΔE is approximately ħ divided by their respective lifetimes.

Let me compute that. The Planck constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So, for E1 (τ1=1e-9 s), ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J. To convert this to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE1 = (1.05457e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1e-25 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-6, so 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 is approximately 6.58e-7 eV. So about 0.66 microeV.

Similarly, for E2 (τ2=1e-8 s), ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8) = (1.05e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.56e-8 eV, which is about 0.066 microeV.

So, the uncertainty in E1 is about 6.6e-7 eV, and E2 is about 6.6e-8 eV. Wait, that's a big difference. So the uncertainty for E1 is larger than that of E2.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, or perhaps each's uncertainty. Or perhaps it has to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Hmm.

Because if the energy difference is larger than each ΔE, then they can be resolved. Because if the separation is larger than the uncertainty in each, then you can tell them apart. So for example, if E2 - E1 is greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then you can distinguish.

Looking at the options, the energy difference needs to be larger
