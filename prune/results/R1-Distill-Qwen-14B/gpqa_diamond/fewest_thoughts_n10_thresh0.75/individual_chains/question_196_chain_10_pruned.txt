Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. So, the mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max. Oh right, and the speed of light is c, so relativity must come into play here.

Wait, in a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But this is relativistic, so things are different. I remember that in special relativity, momentum isn't just mass times velocity anymore; there's the gamma factor involved.

So, the force in the relativistic case would probably involve the relativistic momentum. Let me recall. Momentum p is gamma * m * v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that tie into the force from the oscillator?

Wait, Hooke's law gives a force F = -kx. In a harmonic oscillator, the restoring force is proportional to displacement. In the relativistic case, maybe the equation of motion changes. Hmm, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is F = m d²x/dt² = -k x. So, the equation is m d²x/dt² + k x = 0. But relativistically, maybe the mass becomes gamma m, but that complicates things. Alternatively,
