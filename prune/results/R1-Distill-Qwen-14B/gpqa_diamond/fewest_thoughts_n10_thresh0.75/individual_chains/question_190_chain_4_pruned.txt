Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me five nucleophiles, and I need to arrange them from most reactive to least reactive. The options are A to D, each giving a different order.

The nucleophiles listed are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Wait, so I need to compare their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on the solvent and the basicity of the nucleophile. In a protic solvent like water, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the more reactive it is. But wait, in a protic solvent, larger, less charged nucleophiles are better because they're less stabilized by solvation. Or is it the opposite?

Wait no, in a protic solvent, strong bases are usually poor nucleophiles because they get heavily solvated. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles in such solvents. Or is that only in a solvent where the nucleophile is more stabilized? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the strength of the base. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents, the stabilization due to solvation can hinder their nucleophilicity. So in aqueous solution (protic), less basic nucleophiles are better because they aren't as tightly held by the solvent.

Wait, so let me list the nucleophiles with their strengths. 

First, I need to figure out which are stronger bases. The stronger the base, the more it will be deprotonated in solution, but in aqueous solution, it's more about their nucleophilic strength despite solvation.

Let me list each compound:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a cyclohexoxide. O- with a methyl group. It's a strong base because it's an alkoxide.

2. Hydroxide: OH-. Also a strong base. Very strong, in fact. But in aqueous solution, it's highly solvated,
