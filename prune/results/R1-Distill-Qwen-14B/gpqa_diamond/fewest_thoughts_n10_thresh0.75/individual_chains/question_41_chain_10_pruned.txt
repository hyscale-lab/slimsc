Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me break it down.

The setup says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light is in the glass relative to the observer. Oh wait, and c is given as 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum.

I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, you have to consider both the properties of the medium and the motion of the medium itself. I think this might involve some relativity or maybe just relative velocity addition. But wait, the speed of light in a medium, like glass, is given by c/n. So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the light speed would be 1/n. But since the glass is moving, this might change.

Wait, but when you have a medium moving, how does that affect the speed of light measured in the lab frame? I'm a bit confused. Is this a case where we can consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity? Or is it simpler, using just Galilean addition because the speed is low?

Wait, speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but that's in a vacuum. But the problem is about light inside a medium, not a vacuum. So the glass is moving, but the
