Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. Hmm, I remember something about relative velocities here. I think this has to do with the addition of velocities, maybe using special relativity? Or is it just a simple classical approach?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is usually v = c/n, right? But in this case, because the medium (glass) is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light in the lab frame?

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, the observer in the lab would see a different speed. Oh, right, because velocities don't just add linearly when you're dealing with speeds close to c, but in this case, since the glass is moving at velocity v (which I assume is much less than c), maybe the classical addition applies? Or perhaps even the relativistic velocity addition formula is needed?

Wait, no. Because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame according to special relativity. Oh wait, but in this case, we're talking about light propagating through a medium. Does that change things?

Hmm. Let me recall. In a medium, the speed of light is c/n in the rest frame of the medium. But when the medium is moving, the observed speed of the light from the medium's frame to the lab's frame would depend on how the velocities transform.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So light's speed in the glass (from the glass's frame) is c/n. But how does that transform to the lab frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light' = c/n. But from the lab
