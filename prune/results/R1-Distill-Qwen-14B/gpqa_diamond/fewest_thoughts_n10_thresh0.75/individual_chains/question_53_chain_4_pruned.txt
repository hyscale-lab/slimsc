Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are four different formulas, all with varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen atoms. 

First, let's parse the information given. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, meaning there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a key functional group here. Esters typically show strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum. So, that's one substituent—a ester group. 

Looking at the ¹H NMR data: there are six signals in total. Let's break them down. 

1. Two signals for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in different positions, leading to different splitting patterns. If the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets, each as doublets. But wait, the NMR says two signals, each corresponding to aromatic-H. Hmm, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, you usually have two types of aromatic protons: the two ortho to substituents, which are equivalent, and the two meta, which are also equivalent, but wait no, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. Wait, no, wait—wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons. Para substitution would mean two substituents are across from each other. So, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: those adjacent to the substituents (ortho), and those opposite (para). Wait, no, wait. For a para-substituted benzene with two groups, each substituent is in the 1 and 3 positions? No, wait, para is 1 and 4 positions. Wait, maybe this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think again. For a di-substituted benzene, when the two substituents are in the para position, the ring has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Each substituent is across from the other. So, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the ones adjacent to substituents (ortho) and the ones opposite (para), but in this case, since there are two substituents, maybe the structure is such that the aromatic protons are split into two groups. For example, in para-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene), the aromatic protons are two doublets. Or perhaps that’s for ortho positions. Wait, no. Wait, in para-xylene, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons are all equivalent in pairs. So, perhaps in this case, there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the NMR.
