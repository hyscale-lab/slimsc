Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device when it's in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. I think it's used for something like tunnel diodes or maybe LEDs when they're off, so dark current is when there's no light emission, just the current due to the applied voltage.

The equation given is J equals (9/8) epsilon mu V squared over L cubed. So the variables are epsilon (dielectric constant), mu (mobility), V (voltage), and L (length of the device). Right, the equation is J = (9/8) ε μ (V²)/(L³).

Now the question is about which statement is true regarding the validity of this equation. The options are A to D.

I need to recall the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. From what I remember, the Mott-Gurney equation applies in the SCLC regime, which is when the space charge (the accumulation of charge near the contacts) is so significant that it limits the current. This usually happens in devices where the current is dominated by the electric field created by the charge itself, like in very thin devices or under high voltages.

Oh wait, the Mott-Gurney derivation assumes that the device is single-carrier, meaning only one type of carrier (electrons or holes) contributes to the current. So any option talking about two-carrier devices would be out. Looking at the options, D mentions a two-carrier device. So D is probably incorrect.

Another thing, the equation assumes that the contacts are Ohmic. Ohmic contacts don't have any barrier for the carriers, so there's no Schottky effect. So if an option mentions a Schottky contact, that would be wrong because that introduces a barrier. Looking at the options, C says Schottky contact, so C is out.

The equation also assumes that the device is trap-free. Traps would cause the carriers to be scattered or delayed, affecting the current. So any statement that allows traps would make the equation invalid. So options that don't mention trap-free are incorrect. Let's see the options.

Option A says trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, and negligible drift current. Wait, no, the Mott-Gurney equation is about space-charge-limited current, which is when the space charge is dominant. So I think the derivation includes drift current, but maybe in a particular way. Or perhaps the equation is for when the current is due to drift and the space charge is the main factor.

Wait, wait, in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge, and the carriers are accelerated by the electric field. So the current is due to drift. Hmm, but the equation might involve the mobility (which is part of drift current). So the Mott-Gurney equation is applicable when the current is dominated by drift and space charge effects, not diffusion.

Wait, another point: the derivation of Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is space-charge-limited, so it's valid when the electric field is strong enough that the space charge itself determines the electric field, leading to a quadratic dependence on voltage. So under these conditions, diffusion effects are negligible because the carriers are moving quickly due to the strong electric field, so they don't have time to diffuse much. So the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion.

So, the correct conditions should be: single-carrier, trap-free, Ohmic contacts (so no barrier), and negligible diffusion current.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current. That sounds right.

Option A: negligible drift current? Wait, no. The Mott-Gurney equation includes drift current because it's the dominant factor. So if an option says negligible drift current, that would be incorrect. So A is talking about negligible drift current, which is wrong because the equation accounts for drift.

Option C: Schottky contact, so wrong because of the barrier. So no.

Option D: two-carrier, so wrong.

So the correct statement is option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the charge carrier mobility, and \( L \) is the length of the device. The validity of this equation depends on specific conditions:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, where only one type of carrier (electrons or holes) contributes to the current. Two-carrier devices are not valid for this equation.

2. **Trap-free**: The equation assumes the device is trap-free, meaning there are no defects or impurities that scatter or trap carriers. Any traps would invalidate the equation.

3. **Ohmic contact**: The contacts must be Ohmic, meaning there is no carrier injection barrier. Schottky contacts, which introduce a barrier, are not valid for this equation.

4. **Negligible diffusion current**: In the SCLC regime, the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes negligible diffusion current.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Mentions negligible drift current, which is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that drift current is significant and dominates the behavior. This makes Option A invalid.
- **Option B**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This matches the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation and is correct.
- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier and invalidates the equation. This makes Option C incorrect.
- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, which is not valid for the Mott-Gurney equation. This makes Option D incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is Option B, as it accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

Answer: B
