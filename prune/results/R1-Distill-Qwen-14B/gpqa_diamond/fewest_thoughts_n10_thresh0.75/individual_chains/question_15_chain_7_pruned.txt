Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

So, the scenario is that researchers want to observe the transit of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they want to pick the one with the highest chance of transiting. Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

The key points given are:
- Both have the same mass.
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 takes, say, 100 days, Planet_1 takes about 33 days.
- Both have circular orbits.
- The host stars have different masses but the same radius. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius, which is a bit unexpected because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_2's star is evolved but not larger. Hmm.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital inclination relative to our line of sight. For a planet to transit, its orbit must be edge-on. The probability is higher if the star's size is smaller relative to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the formula for the transit probability. I think it's roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, especially for Earth-like planets, it's approximately R_star / a. So a planet with a larger semi-major axis (farther from the star) and a smaller star has a higher probability of transiting because the ratio R/a is higher.

Wait, no, let me think again. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the area that allows transit is a small cone around the edge-on orbit. The probability is like (R_star / a) squared, or maybe it's (R_star / a). Hmm, I need to get this right.

Wait, the transit probability is actually given by the formula (R*/a) * (1 + (R_p/a)), but since R_p is much smaller than R*, and a is the semi-major axis, the probability is roughly (R* / a). Because when a is smaller (planet is closer), R*/a is larger, so higher chance. Wait, that can't be right because if a planet is closer, its orbit is more likely to be edge-on? Or wait, no, the transit probability is the chance that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) because the star's size determines the area where the planet can cross our line of sight.

Wait, I might be mixing this up. Let me think of it in terms of geometry. The transit occurs only if the planet's orbit is within a certain cone relative to our line
