Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem is about a star whose surface temperature changes when dark spots cover part of it. The question is about how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

First, let's parse the given data. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but I'm not sure how spots affect the overall temperature. Dark spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the star emits less total flux, but how does that translate to the overall Teff?

Wait, the Teff is the effective temperature, which is based on the total luminosity. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σTeff^4. When spots are present, the total luminosity changes because part of the surface is darker. So the effective temperature would decrease. But the problem says that when 40% is covered, the Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, perhaps that's the observed effective temperature when considering all the surface, spots and all. So the overall photospheric temperature is now lower.

Now, the main part: in the photosphere, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) is observed. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We’re to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the Boltzmann equation should apply. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)) ), where g's are the statistical weights
