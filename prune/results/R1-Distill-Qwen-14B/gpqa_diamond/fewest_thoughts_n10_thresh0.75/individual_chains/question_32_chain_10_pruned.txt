Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. They also mention that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, lithium usually has 3 protons and varying neutrons depending on the isotope. So Li-6 would have 3 neutrons because it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons (since 3+3=6). So X is Li-6.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its velocity, but I'm a bit confused about whether to use relativistic equations since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c is pretty fast). So relativistic effects are definitely important here.

The first thing I need to find is the total energy of the nucleus. The formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Let me compute gamma first. Let me compute (v/c)² which is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.0784) is approximately 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Yeah, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is approximately 1/0.28 = 3.5714. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately. Let me try a calculator approach. 0.0784 is the denominator inside the square root. Let me compute it precisely. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is indeed exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me think again about the calculation: 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.96 squared
