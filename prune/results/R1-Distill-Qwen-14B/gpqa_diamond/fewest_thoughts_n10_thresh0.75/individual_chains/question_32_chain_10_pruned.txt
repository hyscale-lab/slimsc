Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is about finding the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Wait, Li with 3 neutrons is Li-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons, so adding 3 neutrons makes it mass number 6. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we need to use the relativistic energy equations. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. But wait, sometimes in these problems, they might be referring to the kinetic energy or the total energy. I need to be careful.

The problem asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So I think it's the kinetic energy they're asking for because the options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. Or is it the total energy? Wait, no, the total energy would be higher because it includes rest mass. Let me clarify.

The formula for total energy is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). Kinetic energy is E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) m c².

But the question is about the energy of the collider. I think particle colliders usually quote their energy in terms of the kinetic energy per particle, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation and see which option it matches.

First, I need to find gamma for v = 0.96c. Let's compute that. v is 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but let me recalculate that. Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes, so that's correct.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Well, the atomic mass unit, u, is about 1.66e-27 kg. Wait, but maybe I can use the mass in terms of u first.

The mass of a Li-6 nucleus: Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So total mass is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = let's compute that.

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828. 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995. Adding them together: 3.021828 +3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the nucleus isn't exactly the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due
