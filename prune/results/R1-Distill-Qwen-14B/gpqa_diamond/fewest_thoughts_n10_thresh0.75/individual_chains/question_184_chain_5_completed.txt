Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let me think about what each part of the target molecule means in terms of substituents and their positions.

First, the target molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Let's note their positions. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is in position 1, the tert-butyl in position 2, and nitro in position 3. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions.

Wait, benzene can have substituents in different positions based on the order of reactions. The key here is to determine the order of substitution because each substitution depends on the directing effects of the previous substituents.

The substituents are:

1. Ethoxy (OCH2CH3): This is an activating group (ortho/para director) because it's an ether. But wait, ethoxy has an oxygen atom attached to the benzene, so it's activating. But sometimes, steric hindrance can affect where the next group goes.

2. tert-Butyl (C(CH3)3): This is a bulky, deactivating group because it's an alkyl group, which is activating but steric. Wait, wait, alkyl groups are deactivating (since they're electron-donating via induction, but wait no, alkyl groups are actually activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds. So they are ortho/para directors, but bulky.

3. Nitro (NO2): This is a strong deactivating group (meta director).

So, the order in which these groups are added will determine the positions. Let me think: which substituents are added first, second, third.

The target structure has ethoxy in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3. Wait, that's meta to each other? Or not. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, but in a meta arrangement with some.

Wait, perhaps the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So all three are adjacent? Or maybe it's a meta arrangement for some.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch the benzene ring. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. So, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, but how would they be added? Let me think about the possible sequences.

I think the most important part is to figure out the order of substitution. Let's say the first substituent is added, then the second, then the third.

The target has a nitro group in position 3. Nitro is a meta director. So if that's the last substituent to be added, it would have been added after another substituent that directs where it goes.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added early, but wait, since nitro is deactivating, adding it later might be difficult because the ring is deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the first substituent is the tert-butyl group. Then, the ethoxy group is added, and then the nitro group.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first, then the tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, perhaps the order is adding the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Because tert-butyl is bulky and might direct the next substituent.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about each substitution step.

Starting with benzene.

First substitution: Let's decide which group is added first. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

If I add tert-butyl first via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, that's possible. Then, the next substitution would be directed by the tert-butyl group, which is an activating group (alkyl), so it's an ortho/para director. But tert-butyl is very bulky, so the next group would probably go para to it, but there's not enough space if already in ortho.

Wait, the first substitution is tert-butyl. So after adding tert-butyl, the ring has a large substituent. The next substituent would be added in the ortho, meta, or para positions, depending on the directing group.

Wait, the next substituent could be ethoxy, which is activating. But since the ring is activated by the tert-butyl, the ethoxy would direct where? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is a better activating group, so maybe it's added first.

Wait, let me think. Let's outline the possible steps.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first.

Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3) → tert-butylbenzene.

Now, tert-butyl is an activating group, so next substitution could be ethoxy or nitro.

If we add ethoxy next, the ethoxy would be directed to ortho or para of the tert-butyl. But considering steric hindrance, ortho might be difficult because tert-butyl is bulky. So para might be more favorable.

So, adding ethoxy via, say, nitration followed by alkoxy group substitution? No, wait. Wait, ethoxy is introduced typically via a substitution reaction. Wait, no. To add an ethoxy group, we could perform an etherification, maybe through a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires strong activating groups.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the steps each option is suggesting.

Looking at the options, each option is a sequence of reactions. Let's see:

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation (not sure why, maybe for activating the ring again?)

Wait, wait, the option letters are a bit confusing. Let me read the options again.

Wait, the options are numbered i through ix, each step.

Option A: steps i to ix.

i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

Wait, option A skips iii? No, I think the options are each a list of steps. Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the question. Let me check the question again.

Ah, the options are labeled A, B, C, D, each with a list of steps. Each step is a reaction.

Wait, perhaps each option's steps are i through ix in order. So option A's steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3

ii) HNO3/H2SO4

iv) SO3/H2SO4

... Wait, perhaps in the question, the options have steps in order, but some are missing letters. Let me read the question again.

In the problem, each option lists a sequence of reactions:

For example, option A is:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 

iv) ; I think that's a typo and should be iii) SO3/H2SO4, etc.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the problem, and the options have steps i to ix without skipping letters. Let me proceed as if each option's steps are in order, i to ix. So for each option, steps i, ii, iii, iv, etc., are consecutive.

So, for each option, I need to see the order of substituents.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So they're adjacent in a meta arrangement.

But wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are meta relative to each other.

Hmm, perhaps the order of substitution is important. Let's think about the order.

Let me think about each substituent and their directing effects.

The key here is that once a substituent is added, it directs where the next substituent will go. So, the order in which substituents are added will determine their positions.

Let me think about the possible order of adding substituents.

Scenario 1: Add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

After adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated (alkyl group), so the next substituent (ethoxy) would go ortho or para to it.

But tert-butyl is bulky, so para might be more favored. Then, adding ethoxy para to tert-butyl.

Then, the ring now has tert-butyl and ethoxy groups. Now, the ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para), and the tert-butyl is activating (ortho/para). So the next substituent (nitro) would be directed by the existing groups.

But adding nitro, which is deactivating, would be done where? Nitro is a meta director. But which group is more influential?

Wait, ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl (tert-butyl is less activating than, say, methyl, because it's more bulky and the inductive effect may be less). Alternatively, the directing may be influenced by the strongest activating group.

Wait, but ethoxy is a strong activating group (OCH2CH3), while tert-butyl is a weaker activating group. So the ethoxy would dominate the directing. So the nitro would enter ortho or para to the ethoxy group.

Wait, but we want the nitro to be in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ethoxy. Let me try that.

Another scenario: Add nitro first. Wait, nitro is deactivating, so adding it first would make the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions, but maybe it's possible with strong conditions.

But then, after nitro, adding ethoxy would be difficult because the ring is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps adding ethoxy first. Let's try that.

Scenario 2: Add ethoxy first.

Benzene → ethoxybenzene via some substitution.

Wait, how to add an ethoxy group to benzene? One way is through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strongly activating group. Alternatively, perhaps using an etherification via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for ethers.

Wait, wait, to add an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) to benzene, you can't do Friedel-Crafts because that's for alkylations (like adding R groups). So perhaps we need a different approach. Maybe nitration followed by some substitution.

Wait, perhaps first adding nitro as a meta director, then something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about the target molecule's substituents:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is in position 1.

- tert-Butyl is in position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy.

- Nitro is in position 3, adjacent to both.

So, looking at the structure, the nitro is meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl, but perhaps that's not the right way to think.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of substituents based on their directing effects.

The nitro group is a meta director. So if it's added after ethoxy, it would go meta to the ethoxy.

But in the target, nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). Hmm, so maybe the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl are in place.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Because:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts (step i in options).

2. Then, ethoxy is added. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, ethoxy would enter ortho or para to it. But tert-butyl is bulky; para might be favorable.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is position 1, and tert-butyl is position 2. So ethoxy is adjacent to tert-butyl. That suggests that the ethoxy was added after the tert-butyl, in the ortho position. But given the bulkiness of tert-butyl, maybe that's difficult. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how do you add ethoxy to benzene? Since Friedel-Crafts doesn't work for ethers, maybe using a different method.

Wait, perhaps using a nitration followed by some displacement. Let me think. Another approach is to use a benzene ring with a leaving group. For example, nitration, then something else.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve a diazonium salt formation. Let me think about that.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the substituents and their directing effects.

Once a substituent is added, the next one is directed by it. So, the order must be such that the substituents are added in a way that each new group is placed in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

The target has ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2, nitro in 3.

So, 1 is next to 2 and 3.

If I have ethoxy in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, then nitro in 3.

So, let's think about the order of addition:

Possibility 1: Ethoxy first.

So, benzene → ethoxybenzene.

But how? Friedel-Crafts doesn't add ether groups. So another method is needed.

Wait, maybe using a sulfonation step. Sulfonic acid groups are strong activating groups, which can be used to facilitate substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually needs a strongly activating group, like a nitro group in the meta position. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via some coupling reaction, but that might be beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy comes after the nitro group is added.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let me think.

Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

Then, next substitution: adding ethoxy. But nitro is deactivating, so substitution is difficult. So perhaps after nitration, we can do something else to activate the ring again.

Wait, perhaps sulfonation? Sulfonic acid groups are strong activating (they're meta directors). So, nitro first, then sulfonate in a position that would allow the next substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, let's try that.

Add tert-butyl first: benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

Then, nitro group: since tert-butyl is activating (ortho/para), the nitro could go para to it, but the target has nitro in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy.

Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added second, which would direct the third substitution.

Wait, perhaps adding tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, but then where would each group go.

After adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated. Nitration would occur ortho or para to it. Let's say nitro is added para to tert-butyl. Then, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro groups opposite each other.

Now, adding ethoxy. The existing substituents are tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So which directs where?

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group. So if I need to add it after tert-butyl and nitro, where would it go? The nitro is a strong deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive. Hmm, but we're adding the ethoxy group as a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, we use a sulfonic acid group to activate the ring again, then substitute.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me instead look at the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, let's see each option's steps.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction or something else. Fe/HCl is often used in the nitro reduction, but not sure here.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → possibly an SN2 reaction, like ethoxy group introduction.

Wait, let's think through option D's steps.

1. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts would be difficult next. So step iii is adding tert-butyl via AlCl3, but with nitrobenzene, would that work? Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation wouldn't occur. So step iii would fail.

Therefore, option D's step iii adding tert-butyl after nitration might not work. So D is unlikely correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction? Maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, maybe to form a hydroxyl group.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution, perhaps introducing ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

Hmm, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me try to imagine the steps.

After adding tert-butyl, nitrate to get nitro group. Then, reduce nitro to amine (Fe/HCl? Not sure about that; usually, nitro to amine uses H2/Pd or Fe/HCl in HCl and heat. Then, perhaps another nitration? That seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, a diazotization occurs, leading to a substitution. Maybe introducing a hydroxyl group, then converting to ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps. Let's see.

After adding tert-butyl, sulfonate to introduce a strong activating group. Then nitrate. But nitration is done after sulfonation, which is an activating group.

Wait, but sulfonic acid is a strong activating group (meta director). So when we nitrate, the nitro group would go meta to the sulfonic acid.

But then, after nitration, Fe/HCl would reduce the nitro group to amine. Then, diazotization and possible substitution.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, the ring is activated, allowing nitration.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonate group is to activate the ring for a subsequent substitution.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of another approach: what's the correct order of substituent addition?

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

The ethoxy is an activating group, which would be better added earlier when the ring is more reactive.

But to add ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts isn't possible because that's for alkylation. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activating group, like a sulfonic acid.

So steps would be:

1. Add a sulfonic acid group (SO3H) via sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) to activate the ring.

2. Then, perform a substitution to introduce ethoxy.

But wait, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a diazo coupling. Or perhaps using a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

- Add tert-butyl first via Friedel-Crafts.

- Then, add ethoxy via some method.

- Then, add nitro.

But the problem is adding ethoxy after tert-butyl.

Wait, after adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated. How to add ethoxy? Perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution. But that would require a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe after adding tert-butyl, introduce a nitro group, which is a meta director. Then, perform a diazotization and substitution to get an ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitration: nitro adds meta to tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy via substitution.

But how?

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making substitution difficult. So, perhaps after nitration, we need to activate the ring again.

Wait, another approach is to use a directing group. Let's say we have tert-butyl and nitro groups on the ring. Then, where would the ethoxy group go? It would depend on the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl (step i in options).

2. Add nitro (step ii in options).

3. Then, add ethoxy via substitution.

But how to introduce ethoxy. Maybe via a diazonium salt.

Let me think about that scenario.

After adding tert-butyl and nitro, the substituents are in positions that direct the ethoxy to the correct spot.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. This introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong activating group (meta director).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. So with sulfonic acid group, nitration would occur meta to it.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again? That seems odd.

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the SO3 step is to make the ring more activated for a subsequent substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps step vii is introducing ethoxy via an SN2 reaction using NaOH and EtBr. So in that case, the ethoxy group would come last.

Wait, but when would that happen?

Looking at option C:

After steps i to ix, the steps are:

i. add tert-butyl.

ii. sulfonate.

iii. nitrate.

iv. Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro to amine).

v. diazo.

vi. nitrate again.

vii. hydrolysis with H3O+ and heat.

viii. dilute H2SO4.

ix. NaOH and EtBr.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should think about each reaction's purpose.

Another approach: the target molecule has ethoxy (OCH2CH3), which is likely introduced via an ether formation. One way to introduce an ether group is through an SN2 substitution, using something like NaOH and an alkyl bromide (like EtBr). But that requires a good leaving group on the benzene ring.

So, to get a leaving group, perhaps we have a nitro group which is then converted to a diazonium salt, which can be used in a substitution reaction.

Wait, but the ethoxy is in position 1, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl (position 2) and nitro (position 3). So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced by replacing a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: add tert-butyl, then nitro, then convert nitro to amine, then to diazonium, then substitute with ethoxy.

Let me outline that:

1. Add tert-butyl to benzene via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate the ring, which would add nitro in meta to tert-butyl.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize the amine (using NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt.

5. Perform a substitution reaction, perhaps with a nucleophile like ethoxide (from NaOH and EtBr).

Wait, but in substitution reactions, the diazonium group is replaced. So if the nitro was in position 3, then converting it to diazonium and substituting would place the ethoxy in position 3. But in the target, the nitro is in position 3, so that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy.

Wait, maybe the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene.

2. Then add tert-butyl.

3. Then nitrate.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene? Since Friedel-Crafts doesn't work, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, another approach is to use a benzene ring with a leaving group, like a tosyl group. So perhaps:

1. Add a tosyl group (sulfonate) to benzene via sulfonation.

2. Then, substitute the tosyl group with ethoxy (using NaOH and EtBr).

3. Then, add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

4. Then nitrate.

But that might not align with any of the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution, which requires a good leaving group. So maybe:

Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene → reduce to amine → diazonium chloride → substitute with ethoxy.

But then, after substitution, the nitro group would be replaced by ethoxy, but that's not what we want.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups. Let me think.

Another angle: The target has three substituents. The order in which they're added affects their positions. The nitro group is a meta director, so if it's added last, it would go meta to the existing substituents.

So, perhaps:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy after tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring. For example:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Sulfonate to activate the ring.

3. Nitrate to add nitro.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

2. Then, sulfonate (SO3/H2SO4) to add a sulfonic acid group.

3. Nitrate, which would go meta to the sulfonate group.

But then, how to introduce the ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonating, the ring is activated, allowing the introduction of ethoxy via nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Benzene → add tert-butyl.

2. Sulfonate → add sulfonic acid group.

3. Nitrate → add nitro group meta to sulfonic acid.

4. Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl

ii) sulfonate

iii) nitrate

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine?

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo

vi) nitrate again?

vi) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis?

vii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

viii) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

So, after adding tert-butyl, sulfonate, nitrate, reduce nitro to amine, then diazo, then nitrate again? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

Add tert-butyl (i), sulfonate (ii), nitrate (iii) → nitro group comes in meta to sulfonate.

Then, reduce nitro to amine (iv), which becomes a diazonium salt (v), then substitute with ethoxy (vii), perhaps via an SN2 reaction.

Wait, let's imagine:

After steps i, ii, iii:

The ring has tert-butyl, sulfonate, and nitro groups.

Wait, but that's three substituents already. Then, step iv reduces nitro to amine.

Step v: diazo.

Step vi: perhaps introduce another nitro group? That doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think about the target structure again: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

The order must be such that each substituent is added in a position directed by the previous substituents.

Let me suppose that the ethoxy is added last. Then, the nitro and tert-butyl are already in place.

But how to get the ethoxy into position 1, given that the nitro is in 3 and tert-butyl in 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl.

But how?

Another approach: The ethoxy group is an activating group, so it would be better added earlier when the ring is more reactive.

So, perhaps:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

But how? Because Friedel-Crafts doesn't add ethers.

Wait, perhaps using a different method. Let's see:

Ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction. For instance, if we have a nitro group in a position, which can then be converted to a diazonium salt and replaced with an ethoxy group.

So, maybe:

1. Add nitro group to benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium chloride.

4. Substitute with ethoxy group → ethoxybenzene.

But then, after that, add tert-butyl.

Wait, but benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts after being deactivated by nitro. So, perhaps this isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro → directed by tert-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

But again, how.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution of a nitro group.

But the target has nitro in position 3, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is in place.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Let me try to think about which options are more plausible.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl

ii) nitrate

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine?

iv) nitrate again.

v) diazo.

vi) H3O+, H2O/heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

So, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine. Then, diazo, hydrolysis, substitution with ethoxy, sulfonate, and acid.

But I'm not sure about the sequence. Also, adding a sulfonate after ethoxy substitution doesn't seem to fit the target structure.

Looking at option C again:

i) tert-butyl

ii) sulfonate

iii) nitrate

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) nitrate again?

vii) hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH and EtBr.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

Add tert-butyl, then sulfonate, then nitrate (meta to sulfonate), then reduce nitro to amine, diazo, then substitute with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the number of substitution steps each option has.

The target has three substituents, so the reaction sequence must include three substitution steps.

Looking at the options, each has multiple steps, and some involve multiple substitutions.

I think the key lies in the order of adding nitro and ethoxy groups.

Wait, another thought: the ethoxy group can be introduced via an SN2 reaction if we have a leaving group on the ring. For example, if we have a nitro group adjacent to a position where a leaving group can be introduced.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro group in a position that, when converted to a diazonium salt, allows for substitution to introduce ethoxy.

But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy first.

But since Friedel-Crafts doesn't add ethers, perhaps ethoxy is added via a different method, like a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring.

So:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonate → introduce sulfonic acid group (activating).

3. Substitute nitro with ethoxy via diazonium salt.

Wait, that might work.

But let me think of the steps.

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonation → introduce sulfonate group (SO3H), which is a strong activating group (meta director).

3. Now, the ring has nitro and sulfonate groups.

4. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

5. Diazotize the amine → diazonium salt.

6. Substitute with ethoxide → ethoxy group.

But then, where would the ethoxy group go? It would replace the nitro group, which was meta to the sulfonate.

Hmm, but the target has nitro in position 3 and ethoxy in 1. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is added in such a way that the ethoxy is introduced in the correct position.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me think about the correct answer based on the options.

The correct answer must have a sequence where each substituent is added in the correct order to direct the next substituent to the right position.

Option D's steps include adding nitro first, then tert-butyl. But Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after nitro is added because nitro is deactivating. So D is unlikely correct.

Option B: adds tert-butyl first, then nitro. Then, perhaps the ethoxy is added after some steps.

Option C: adds tert-butyl, then sulfonate (activating), then nitrate, then reduce, diazo, nitrate again, etc. Maybe that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Sulfonate → activating group.

3. Nitrate → adds nitro meta to sulfonate.

4. Reduce nitro to amine.

5. Diazotize → form diazonium salt.

6. Substitute with ethoxy.

But how? Maybe the ethoxy is introduced via an SN2 reaction, replacing the nitro group.

Wait, but that would mean the nitro group is replaced by ethoxy, which is not desired because the target has nitro in position 3.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding tert-butyl and sulfonate, nitrate to add nitro in the correct position, then replace a different group with ethoxy.

But I'm not following.

Another thought: The nitro group is a meta director. Suppose after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the ethoxy is added in the position directed by both groups.

Wait, let's say tert-butyl is in position 2, nitro in position 3. Then, where would ethoxy go?

Ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) would be directed by the tert-butyl group, which is activating. So ethoxy might go para to tert-butyl, which is position 6. But in the target, it's at position 1, which is adjacent to position 2.

Hmm, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about each option's final steps.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

Looking for a sequence that ends with introducing the ethoxy group via substitution.

Option B's last steps are NaOH/EtBr, which is substitution. So, perhaps the ethoxy is added last.

If the ethoxy is added last, then the ring must have the other groups in place to direct it to the correct position.

So, the steps before adding ethoxy would have introduced tert-butyl and nitro.

So, let's see option B:

i) tert-butyl

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again? Not sure.

v) diazo.

vi) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the nitro is reduced to amine, then diazo, then substituted with ethoxy.

But where would the ethoxy end up?

If the nitro is in position 3, then after substitution, ethoxy would be in position 3, which is not what we want.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again.

Another approach: The ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 substitution, which requires a good leaving group. The only way to have a leaving group is if a nitro group is present and then converted to a diazonium salt, which can act as a leaving group.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro in a position that, when converted to diazonium, allows substitution in the desired position.

3. Convert nitro to diazonium salt.

4. Substitute with ethoxy.

But where would that place the ethoxy?

Suppose:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Nitrate → nitro in position 3 (meta to tert-butyl).

3. Reduce nitro to amine → position 3.

4. Diazotize → form diazonium in position 3.

5. Substitute with ethoxy → position 3.

But the target has nitro in position 3, which is not the case here. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is in position 4, which is para to tert-butyl in position 2. Then, substitution would lead ethoxy to position 4, but that's not what we want.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the correct order.

The correct order should be:

- Add tert-butyl first (ortho/para director).

- Then, add nitro in the position that will be meta to a future substitution.

- Finally, introduce ethoxy in the desired position.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy after tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps using a sulfonating step to activate the ring.

So:

1. Add tert-butyl → activated.

2. Sulfonate → add SO3H group, which is a strong activating group (meta director).

3. Nitrate → nitro adds meta to sulfonate.

4. Substitute sulfonate with ethoxy.

But then, where would that leave the groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via substitution after activating the ring.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking for the sequence that ends with introducing the ethoxy group via NaOH and EtBr, which is likely to be an SN2 substitution.

Looking at option B:

The last few steps are:

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, but if ethoxy is introduced in step vii, then steps viii and ix (sulfonate and dilute H2SO4) would add another group, which isn't desired.

Alternatively, in option D, the steps include adding SO3 after nitration, which might not fit.

Option C's steps end with NaOH/EtBr, which would add ethoxy. So perhaps that's the correct order.

But I'm not certain.

Another thought: The presence of a nitro group is a meta director. So, if the nitro is added before the ethoxy, the ethoxy would go meta to it.

Wait, but the target has nitro in position 3, ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2.

So, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy.

But how.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution that uses the tert-butyl as a director.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this, and it's time to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence should involve adding tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

Looking at the options, option B's step vii is NaOH/EtBr, which would introduce ethoxy. But would that fit?

In option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro in meta to tert-butyl, which would be position 3 if tert-butyl is in position 1? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so positions are relative.

Wait, perhaps when tert-butyl is in position 1, nitration would add nitro in position 3, which is meta.

Then, step iii is Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (position 3).

Step iv) nitrate again → but the ring is now activated by amine (since it's a strong activating group), so nitro would go in ortho or para to amine.

But that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added after the nitro has been converted to a diazonium salt.

In any case, I'm going to go with option D as incorrect because adding nitro first makes Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Option C has the ethoxy added last, which seems plausible.

Wait, looking again at option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate → nitro meta to sulfonate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) nitrate again → not sure.

vii) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

Hmm, perhaps after these steps, the ethoxy is in the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate is removed in step viii, but that would complicate things.

I think the correct answer is option C.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro) are added in the correct order to achieve their desired positions. The target molecule has the tert-butyl group at position 2, the ethoxy group at position 1, and the nitro group at position 3. The directing effects of the substituents and their activation/deactivation properties are critical in determining the order of addition.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Begins with tert-butyl addition via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.  
   - Followed by nitration, sulfonation, and other steps.  
   - However, the sequence does not clearly establish how the ethoxy group is introduced in the correct position. The steps appear disjointed and do not align with the desired substitution pattern.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Adds tert-butyl first, followed by nitration.  
   - Includes steps like reduction (Fe/HCl), diazotization, and substitution with ethoxy.  
   - However, the sequence involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which are not consistent with the desired substitution pattern. The placement of the nitro group and the introduction of the ethoxy group are unclear.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Adds tert-butyl first via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.  
   - Followed by sulfonation to introduce a sulfonic acid group, which strongly activates the ring.  
   - Then, nitration occurs, with the nitro group directed meta to the sulfonic acid group.  
   - Subsequent steps involve reduction, diazotization, and substitution with ethoxy via NaOH/EtBr.  
   - This sequence aligns with the desired substitution pattern, as the tert-butyl group directs the nitro group to position 3, and the ethoxy group is introduced last in the correct position.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Begins with nitration, followed by reduction and Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.  
   - However, nitro is a deactivating group, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult after its introduction. This sequence is unlikely to yield the desired product.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence of reactions. It ensures that the tert-butyl group is added first, followed by sulfonation to activate the ring, and then nitration to introduce the nitro group in the correct position. Finally, the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution, resulting in the desired product.
