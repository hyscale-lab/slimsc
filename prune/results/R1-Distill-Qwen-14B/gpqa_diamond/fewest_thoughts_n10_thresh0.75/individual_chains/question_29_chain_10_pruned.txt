Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the target gene sequences. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, presumably by disrupting the gene's function.

So, the intact gene has the sequence provided, and there are four mutants with slight changes. The right mutation would probably disrupt the gene enough so that the compound isn't synthesized anymore. That would likely be a mutation that causes a frameshift or a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Comparing, the first few bases are different. Let's see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Hmm, so the third triplet in the intact gene is TTT (which is Phe), but in Mutant 1, it's TAC, which is Tyr. Wait, the first change is after the third codon. Wait, the first three nucleotides are ATG, methionine. Then next is TTT in intact, TTC in mutant 1? No, wait, maybe I should look more carefully.

Wait, maybe I should line them up:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... 
Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, the first three nucleotides are ATG for Met in both. Next, the second codon: TTT (Phe) in the intact, but TTC in mutant 1? Wait, no, wait, let me look at the
