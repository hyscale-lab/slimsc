Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these titration questions. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The problem says we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, but I'll try to work it out.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, it forms acetate ions and water. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Alright, let's tackle each part one by one. 

Starting with the initial solution after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, no, wait: 20 +20 is 40 cm³, yes.

The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M, and volume is 20 cm³. So the moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when you dilute it to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we start titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the equivalence point first because that's the second part of the question. 

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.001 moles (from earlier). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be (moles)/Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added, but wait, wait. Wait, the diluted solution is 40 cm³, and we're adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized.

At the equivalence point, the solution will consist of the sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+) from the reaction. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will completely deprotonate the acetic acid. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. 

Sodium acetate in water will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions
