Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can get a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh wait, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? So the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and when we add the same volume (20 cm³) of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be 0.025 M. Let me confirm that: initial moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, the volume is 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction should be acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point occurs when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. So let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, so moles = Molarity × Volume. So Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but the question asks for the pH at 25% titration. Hmm, 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

So for both the 25% point and the equivalence point, I need to calculate the pH.

Let me handle each part one by one.

Starting with the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, which is 2.5 cm³, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of acetate will increase by the same amount.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles. So after adding NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed are 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial diluted volume plus the added NaOH. The initial was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³, so total is 42.5 cm³, or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, because this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, but wait, the pKa is given from Ka. The
