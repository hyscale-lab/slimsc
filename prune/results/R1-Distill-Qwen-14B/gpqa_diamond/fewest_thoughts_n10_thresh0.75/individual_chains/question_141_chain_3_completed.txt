Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait, maybe I misread. It's 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh wait, no, benzene-2-d would be something else. Oh wait, maybe it's benzene with a bromine on position 1 and a deuterium (d) on position 2? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? That makes sense. So the structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and a deuterium (which is like a hydrogen but heavier) at position 2.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions or eliminations. Wait, but in what context? Oh right, when dealing with aryl halides, especially under such conditions, it's likely a type of elimination or maybe a coupling reaction. Wait, wait, another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia is a common condition for the formation of aromatic rings via elimination or substitution, possibly a benzidine rearrangement or some kind of nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about what NaNH2 does. It's a strong base and a good source of NH2- ions. In aromatic substitution, maybe it abstracts a proton to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then undergo elimination.

Alternatively, another possibility: this could be a case where the bromide leaves, and the deuterium is involved. Wait, but deuterium is a hydrogen isotope. In some cases, like in elimination reactions, when a proton is abstracted, the adjacent leaving group can leave. So, if the Br is at position 1 and the deuterium is at position 2, maybe this is a case where the base removes the deuterium, but wait, deuterium is not a proton in the same way. Oh wait, no, deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so in the molecule, it's like a hydrogen for all intents and purposes, except for its mass.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. So, if we have Br in position 1 and a hydrogen (or deuterium) in position 2, the base (NH2-) could abstract the hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system. Oh, wait, but perhaps it's a case of forming a benzyn intermediate. Like a benzyne elimination.

Wait, benzyne elimination occurs when a dihalobenzene loses two halide ions to form a triple bond, but that's typically for 1,2-dihalobenzenes. So in our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Wait, but that's only one leaving group. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a typical nucleophile for substitution in aromatic rings unless under specific conditions. Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with only one leaving group, that might not be possible.

Wait, wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. But in this case, the ring has a Br, which is a meta-directing group, and a deuterium. But I'm not sure if the ring is activated enough.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium isn't playing a role in the reaction. Let me think about the positions. If the base abstracts a proton (deuterium) adjacent to the Br, then perhaps the Br leaves as Br-, forming a diradical or a triple bond. Wait, but benzene doesn't form triple bonds easily. Unless it's benzyne.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's recap: Benzyne is a highly strained triple bond in a benzene ring, formed by the elimination of two adjacent halides. So, for example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base would lose two Br atoms to form benzyne. But in this question, there's only one Br and a deuterium. So maybe that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is not a leaving group, but just a regular hydrogen. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 (the deuterium is at position 2), and the Br is at position 1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br-, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 1, and a positive charge adjacent? Or maybe it's a conjugate base.

Wait, but benzene isn't typically very stable with such charges. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a benzene diradical or something else. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: When dehydrohalogenation occurs in an aromatic ring, especially in the presence of a strong base, perhaps a benzene ring with adjacent leaving groups can form a triple bond. But I only have one leaving group here, the Br. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. So, the Br is replaced by an amide group (NH2-). But aromatic substitution with NH2- is tricky because aromatic rings are generally not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution unless they're activated. The presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups can activate the ring for nucleophilic attack.

In this case, the ring has a Br (an electron-withdrawing group) and a deuterium. So perhaps the Br can be substituted by NH2- from NaNH2.

But wait, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the leaving group must be in a position that's activated. For mono-halobenzenes, this is usually difficult because the ring isn't activated enough. But if there's another group that's activating, maybe it's possible.

Wait, in this case, the deuterium is in position 2, adjacent to the Br in position 1. So, perhaps the ring is activated in some way. Wait, but deuterium is just a hydrogen, so it's an activating group (like any alkyl group) but it's a meta director. So, having Br (a meta director) and a deuterium (which is an activating group, but also meta) might not activate the ring enough for nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton (deuterium) from position 2, making it a carbanion, which could then displace the Br in a neighboring position. Wait, but that sounds more like an elimination, perhaps forming a ring contraction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen (the deuterium) from position 2, and the Br leaves, the ring would form a double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in a diene. But wait, benzene is already a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds; introducing another double bond would require a rearrangement, maybe forming a triple bond.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If the base takes the deuterium from position 2, then the Br at position 1 leaves. This would form a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 1 and a positive charge at position 2? Or perhaps a triple bond forms between C1 and C2, creating a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but benzyne typically forms from 1,2-dihalobenzenes. So if I have only one Br and one deuterium, can benzyne form? Hmm. Maybe not, because benzyne requires the loss of two X atoms.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts the deuterium (H), which is at position 2, adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge. Then, the Br leaves, and the ring might undergo some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of elimination, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne). But in that case, you need two adjacent leaving groups, which I don't have here. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to some kind of substitution. For example, the Br is replaced by the amide group (NH2), giving 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But would that be the case?

Wait, but NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, so perhaps it's more likely to abstract a proton or a deuterium, leading to elimination rather than substitution. But in this case, elimination may not be straightforward because of only one leaving group.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking. Let me think about the possible products. The question is about how many possible organic products there are.

If the reaction leads to substitution, the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, but that's not clear. Or perhaps the deuterium is somehow involved in a rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the deuterium is at position 2 and the Br is at position 1. So, when the base abstracts the deuterium, it becomes a carbanion adjacent to the Br. Then, the Br leaves as Br- and the carbanion could combine with another part of the ring.

Wait, but how would that work? If the deuterium is abstracted, forming a negative charge at C2, and Br leaves, creating a positive charge at C1, then perhaps a ring contraction or expansion occurs. Alternatively, a triple bond forms between C1 and C2, creating benzyne, but that would require the loss of two X groups, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium, and the Br leaves, forming a diradical that could rearrange. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a simple substitution where the Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But is that the only product? Or are there other possibilities?

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium doesn't participate in the reaction. If the Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would have the NH2 group at position 1, and the deuterium remains at position 2. So only one product in that case.

But wait, considering the positions, if substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But is that the only possible product? Or are there other products based on where the substitution occurs?

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of benzene with a triple bond, but I'm unclear on how that would happen with only one Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is in a position that allows for a different substitution, but given that it's a deuterium, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is just a spectator in this reaction, and the only product is the substitution of the Br with NH2. So, only one product.

But wait, another possibility: If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, or another position, but I don't see that being adjacent to the Br. Wait, the starting compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the Br is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. The positions are adjacent.

Wait, if the base abstracts the deuterium (H) from position 2, and the Br leaves, perhaps the ring undergoes some rearrangement. For example, could the ring form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, creating benzyne? But benzyne formation typically requires the loss of two adjacent halides. So not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring would lose H and Br, but that would require another X elsewhere, which isn't present. So this might not be the case.

So perhaps the only possible reaction is substitution of Br by NH2, leading to a single product. So the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. Are there any other possible products?

Wait, another angle: Could the deuterium somehow be replaced in the reaction? But NaNH2 is a strong base, but not a strong nucleophile for deuterium exchange unless under specific conditions. I'm not sure if deuterium would be replaced in this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of benzene with a triple bond, but I'm not sure how that would happen with only one Br and one deuterium.

So, putting it all together, I think the only product is the substitution of Br with NH2, resulting in one product. Therefore, the answer is option B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base and a source of NH₂⁻ ions, commonly used in elimination or substitution reactions.

Key considerations for the reaction:

1. **Substitution Reaction**: NaNH₂ can act as a nucleophile, replacing the bromine atom with an amide group (NH₂). This would result in the formation of 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. The deuterium at position 2 is unlikely to interfere with this substitution since it behaves similarly to a hydrogen atom in most reactions.

2. **Elimination Reaction**: For elimination to occur, two adjacent leaving groups are typically required to form a triple bond (benzyne). However, the starting material has only one bromine atom and one deuterium atom, which are not positioned to facilitate benzyne formation. Thus, elimination is unlikely.

3. **Role of Deuterium**: The deuterium at position 2 is not involved in the reaction as a leaving group or in any significant rearrangement. It remains as a spectator, leaving the bromine at position 1 as the reactive site.

Given these considerations, the only plausible reaction is nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the bromine atom is replaced by the amide group (NH₂). This results in a single product: 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

Thus, the number of possible organic products is **1**.
