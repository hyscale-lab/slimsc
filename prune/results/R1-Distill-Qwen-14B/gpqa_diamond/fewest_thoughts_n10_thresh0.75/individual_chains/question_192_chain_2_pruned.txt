Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, okay, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

So, there's this spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and s is less than R because the cavity's radius is r and r is less than R. So the cavity is somewhere inside the conductor, not at the center.

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, what's the setup again? So, the conductor is uncharged initially, but then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor was uncharged, I remember that in such cases, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, but when you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces get induced charges.

Wait, but in this case, since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on the conductor must remain zero. So when we put +q inside the cavity, charges will redistribute. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor must cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. So the cavity's charge +q induces -q on the inner surface.

But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must then have +q, because the inner surface has -q. Because the total conductor charge is zero, inner (-q) and outer (+q) must sum to zero. So the outer surface has +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when we're looking for the electric field at P, we can treat the conductor as a shell with charge +q on the outside. Because the electric field outside a charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at P would be due to the +q charge
