Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. 

So, the setup: there's a spherical conductor of radius R, and inside it, there's a smaller cavity of radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. The conductor itself is initially uncharged, but then a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so L is the distance from the conductor's center to P, and L is greater than R. Also, l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and l is greater than R as well. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So how does the charge inside the cavity affect the conductor's charges?

Oh right, the conductor was neutral, but when you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges will respond. The inner surface of the cavity will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the inner surface would have -q. But since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge on the conductor is now +q (since the cavity's inner surface is -q, and the conductor's own charges must balance that to keep the conductor neutral? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. The charge +q is inside the cavity, so the inner surface of the cavity (which is the conductor's material) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge +q attracts opposite charges. So the inner surface has -q, and since the conductor as a whole is initially neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So -q (inner) + outer = 0 (since the conductor was neutral). So outer must be +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when we're looking at the electric field at P, we
