Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, right. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the expectation values. The formula, if I recall correctly, is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Alright, first things first, let me write down what I know. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as matrices. The state of the system is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). This state is an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. But for the uncertainty in P_z, I think I need to compute the expectation values involving P_z.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z? Or not necessarily? Hmm, no, because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which may have different eigenvectors. So the state vector is in the P_z basis, meaning that each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

But wait, the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is written in terms of |eigenstates of P_z|. So each component of the state vector is the amplitude for that eigenstate.

So the state is given as a column vector: [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Each component is the coefficient for the eigenstates of P_z. Let me denote the eigenstates as |+>, |0>, |->, corresponding to the eigenvalues +ħ, 0, -ħ, respectively. Because looking at P_z's matrix: first row is [ħ, 0, 0], so the first basis vector (eigenstate) is |+>, the second is [0,0,0], so maybe the middle state is |0>, and third is |-> with eigenvalue -ħ.

So the state is a combination of |+>, |0>, and |->. The coefficients are -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2.

Wait, but I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²> for this state. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, this should simplify calculations.

Because in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value of that operator is simply the weighted average of the eigenvalues, with the weights being the probabilities (|c|^2) of each eigenstate.

Wait, but in this state, the components are the amplitudes. So the probability of each eigenstate is |c_i|².

So let's compute the expectation value of P_z, <P_z>. Each eigenstate |i> of P_z contributes c_i^* * c_i * (e
