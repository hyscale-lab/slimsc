Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let me list out the reactions first.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are hints given, so I should definitely look at those.

Let's start by looking at the hints. Hint a) says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it produces 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually involved in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone (which would be compound A) with a ylide.

So if compound A is reacting with a ylide to form an alkene, that suggests that compound A is a ketone. Because the Wittig reaction typically uses aldehydes or ketones. Wait, but wait, the product is an alkene. So, the structure given in the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that mentally. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached.

So the starting material (compound A) is a ketone because the Wittig reaction adds an alkene. So when the ylide (which is a strong base and a nucleophile) attacks the carbonyl group, it forms an oxaphosphorane intermediate, which then loses phosphine oxide and forms the alkene.

So compound A must have a carbonyl group that's part of a cyclopentane ring. Let me think about the structure of compound A. If the product after Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, then the starting ketone must have been 4-methylcyclopentanone or something similar.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with a double bond. So if the product has a substituent that's part of an alkene, that substituent must have come from the ylide.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent at position 4 is a (propan-2-ylidene) group, which is (CH2)CH2C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting the substituent wrong. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, perhaps.

Wait, the cyclopentane ring has
