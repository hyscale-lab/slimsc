Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction scheme, and we need to identify compound E. The compounds go from A to E through a series of reactions. Plus, there are some hints given, so I'll need to use those to figure it out.

Let me break down each step:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (that's nitrous acid, right?) to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Hmm. Also, the hints are important. Let's look at them.

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Wait, phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. So this is a Wittig reaction. The product is an alkene because the ylide adds a double bond. The product structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

So, the product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me sketch this. The substituents are at positions 1 and 2 (two methyl groups), and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's a substituent like CH(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2- attached to a double bond. Let me think: propan-2-ylidene would be the group where the substituent is on the second carbon. So maybe it's (CH3)2C=CH- attached to cyclopentane?

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. On carbon 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent with a double bond. So it's something like:

Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. At position 4, there's a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached? Or maybe it's CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Hmm, not sure. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C=CH- as a substituent. So the structure would be cyclopentane where carbon 4 is connected to a CH2 group which is connected to a (CH3)2C=CH- group? Or is it directly attached? Maybe it's part of a double bond.

Alternatively, propan-2-ylidene is a substituent with a double bond. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=
