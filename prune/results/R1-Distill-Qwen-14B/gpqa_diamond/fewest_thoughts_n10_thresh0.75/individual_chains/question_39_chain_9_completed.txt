Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. Alright, so the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, and the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3 when measured. So, I need to find 'a' such that the probability of finding the particle outside this range is zero. 

Wait a second, I remember that in wave functions, the square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density. So to ensure that the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this interval must be zero. That probably means that the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. 

Wait, but if the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, then perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere. But looking at the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Oh wait, unless the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero beyond that region, but the given expression is only valid within that interval. 

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, which implies that the wave function must go to zero at x=1 and x=3. Let me think. Because if the wave function is non-zero elsewhere, then the probability wouldn't be zero beyond that. 

So, maybe at x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero. Let's plug in x=1 into the wave function. That gives (a / sqrt(2)) -0.5i. If the wave function must be zero at x=1, then both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. But wait, 0.5i is the imaginary part. So the imaginary part is -0.5i. So setting that equal to zero would require -0.5i = 0, which isn't possible. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait another thought: perhaps the wave function is zero outside the interval, but the given expression is valid inside. So, the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and inside it's given by that expression. But then, to make the wave function continuous, perhaps the expression must approach zero at the boundaries. Wait, but the given function at x=1 is a/sqrt(2) -0.5i. For it to be zero, both terms must be zero. But 0.5i isn't zero, so that can't be. So maybe I need to normalize the wave function within the interval.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. Because the problem states that when they measured, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only there. So the probability is non-zero only in that interval. 

So, to find 'a', I should normalize the wave function. The integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. 

So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The absolute square is [a^2/(1+x)] + 0.25 because (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by its complex conjugate (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Wait, because (x - iy)(x + iy) = x² + y². So here, x is a/sqrt(1+x), y is 0.5. So the absolute square would be (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. 

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1. 

Breaking this into two integrals:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each part. 

First integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. 

So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding them: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²: 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. 

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the setup? Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is a complex function. But in reality, for a stationary state, the wave function is usually real or has a specific form. But perhaps in this problem, the wave function is allowed to be complex. 

But when normalizing, the absolute square is correct as I did. So the calculation seems right. So the answer should be option B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we normalize the wave function. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two integrals:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \):  
   This evaluates to \( a^2 \ln(1+x) \) evaluated from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), giving \( a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \):  
   This evaluates to \( 0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), corresponding to option B.

Answer: B
