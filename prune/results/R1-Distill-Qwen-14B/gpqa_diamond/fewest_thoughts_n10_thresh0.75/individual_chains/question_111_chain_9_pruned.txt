Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, the question has two parts, A and B, and each is a reaction leading to a product. I need to determine which option (A, B, C, D) correctly identifies the major products for both reactions.

First, let's tackle reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, and it's reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this is probably an enolate formation reaction. 

Looking at the structure of the starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Wait, cyclohexanone has the carbonyl at position 1. So the numbering would have the carbonyl at C1. Then, the substituents would be at C2 (ethyl and methyl), C6 (methyl), and since it's 2,6-dimethyl, I think. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that at C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group. Hmm, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1, and substituents at 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the ring is substituted at positions 2 and 6.

When a ketone undergoes enolate formation, the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the alpha position. The alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl. In this compound, the carbonyl is at C1, so the alpha carbons would be at C2 and C3. But wait, in a cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 (alpha) and perhaps C6 is another alpha? Or maybe not
