Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of protons and neutrons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also used as a reagent.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. Okay, let's break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. So, perhaps it's a reaction between a metal and an acid? Because metals reacting with acids often produce hydrogen gas, but wait, hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, but the same number of protons and neutrons. That fits W. Wait, but wait, the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron in H2 (each H atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, but wait, wait, most hydrogen is protium, which is H-1, with no neutrons. Oh wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if the molecule is something like H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. What about another molecule? Let me think of other gases. Maybe something like CO2? No, that's a gas, but the molecule has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). So the total protons would be 6 + 16=22? No, wait, each O has 8 protons, so total protons in CO2 is 6 + 16 = 22, and total neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 16*2=32 (each O has 8 neutrons?), wait no, maybe not. So that doesn't match.

Wait another approach. Maybe the gas W is water vapor, H2O. Each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons each, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule would have 2*(1p + 0n) + 8p +8n = 10 protons and 8 neutrons. No, that's 10 vs 8, so no.

Wait, then what gas has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule? Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe CH4? No, that's a gas, but the
