Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So maybe B is something like ice, but wait, ice melts at 273 K. 277 K is a bit higher, maybe a different substance. Alternatively, maybe B is something like glucose or another solid with a melting point near there. Hmm, not sure yet.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is an element or a compound that has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like those with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something similar. Wait, the product after reacting with X has two O atoms. Oh! Maybe the keto acid has a carboxylic acid group, and X is something that deprotonates it or adds something. Or perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the acid, but the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, I'm not sure.

Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known to have a heavier isotope. I'm thinking of common reagents. Could it be something like KMnO4? No, not sure. Or maybe NaOH? No, but NaOH is a base. Wait, maybe it's something like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, the reaction of substance X with a keto acid produces a product with two oxygen atoms. Let me think about this. A keto acid is something like RCOCH3COOH, for example. Maybe when X reacts with it, it changes the structure. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X is an isotope-containing compound, like deuterated. For example, if X is D2O (deuterium oxide), but then when reacting with a keto acid, maybe it exchanges protons for deuterium, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So the molecular formula of W must satisfy that condition. Let me think about possible gases. Hmmm.

What about H2O? No, water's molecule is H2O. The number of protons is 2 (from H2) plus O's 8, so 10. Neutrons would be O's 8 (since oxygen has atomic number 8, so neutral O has 8 electrons, but its neutrons are 8 as well, making it 16O). Wait, but H2O has H (each with 0 neutrons) and O (8). So the total protons in H2O would be 2 (from H2) + 8 (from O) = 10. The total neutrons would be 0 (from H2) + 8 (from O) = 8. So protons (10) ≠ neutrons (8). So that's not it.

What about CH4? No, that's a hydrocarbon. Let me think of another gas. Maybe CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons) and O2 (each O has 8, so 16). Total protons: 6 + 16 = 22. Neutrons: Carbon has 6 (since 12C has 6 neutrons), and each O has 8, so 6 + 8*2 = 22. So protons are 6 + 16 = 22, neutrons are 6 + 16 = 22. Wait, that would make it equal. Oh, so CO2's molecule would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Because each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, and C has 6. So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 8*2 = 22. So that's a possibility. So gas W could be CO2.

But wait, the reaction of X with Y releases CO2. So what's a reaction that produces CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid. Or maybe something like the decomposition of a carbonate. For example, if Y is an acid, like H2SO4, and X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. But then X would be the carbonate, but the question says X has a heavier isotope. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is water and X is something that reacts violently with water, releasing CO2. Wait, what reacts violently with water to produce CO2? Maybe something like sodium bicarbonate, but I'm not sure if that's violent. Or maybe a carbonate with something else. Or perhaps a more reactive metal carbonate.

Wait, but if W is CO2, then the reaction produces this. Also, the precipitate G forms. So maybe X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, producing CO2, and the precipitate is a metal hydroxide or something else. But wait, if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, then the reaction would be: Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. So in that case, the precipitate might not form unless something else is involved.

Wait, another possibility: What if X is a metal, and Y is water. Maybe a metal that reacts with water violently, like potassium or sodium. But then, what gas would form? For example, sodium reacts with water to produce H2 gas. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1H, with 0 neutrons), so that doesn't fit the condition of protons equal to neutrons. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: If X is a carbide, like CaC2. Reacting with water would produce acetylene gas (C2H2), but wait, acetylene has 2 C (each 6 protons) and 2 H (each 1), so total protons would be 6*2 + 1*
