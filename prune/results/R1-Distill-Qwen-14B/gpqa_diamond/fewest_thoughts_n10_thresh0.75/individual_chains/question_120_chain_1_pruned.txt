Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A through D, each with different exponents. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax p (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance d (in parsecs), so d = 1/p.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that the number density of stars is constant in space. Wait, number density would be stars per cubic parsec maybe. So if the density is uniform, n = constant.

The number of stars in a certain volume would then be n multiplied by that volume. But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Parallax relates to distance, so I think I need to consider how the volume changes with distance when you have a thin shell at a certain distance.

Let me think in terms of spherical shells. Imagine shells at a distance d with a thickness dd. The volume of such a shell is 4πd² dd. Oh wait, because the volume between d and d+dd is the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd.

So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) times the volume: n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let's substitute that in. The volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/ (p + dp))^2? Wait, no, maybe I should express everything in terms of p.

Wait, d = 1/p. So dd, the change in d, is -1/p² dp because d = 1/p implies dd = -dp/p². Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need to worry about the negative sign here since I'm dealing with ranges.

So the volume in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp/(p²) ) ). Wait, that might be getting complicated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is proportional to the volume of the shell at distance d=1/p with thickness dd= -dp/p². So the volume is 4πd² dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp/p² ). But the negative sign indicates direction, which isn't important here because we're considering a small positive dp. So I can ignore the sign for now.

But wait, the number of stars should be n * volume, so N = n * 4π (1/p²) * ( - dp/p² ). But the negative is just because as p increases, d decreases. Since we're talking about a small dp, perhaps the exact sign isn't crucial, but the magnitude is.

So simplifying, N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. Because 1/p² from d squared, and another 1/p² from dd. So that's 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So N is stars per dp (unit of parallax). So N = n * 4π / p^4.

But wait, the question is about how the number per unit plx range varies with plx. So it's proportional to 1/p^4. So looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another approach: number per unit volume is n. But how does the number per unit parallax change?

Alternatively, the number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp is N = n * 4π d^2 dd. But since d =1/p, dd = -dp/(p^2). So substituting, N= n *4π (1/p)^2 * (- dp/(p^2)) )= n *4π (-1)/(p^4) dp.

Ignoring the negative, the number is proportional to 1/(p^4) dp. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, why is this so? Because as parallax decreases (distance increases), the volume per unit distance increases, so more stars would be found in larger parallax ranges? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So for a given range in p (say, dp), as p gets smaller (further away), the corresponding range in d is larger (because d is 1/p, so for a small change in p, the change in d is bigger when p is small).

But the number of stars per unit p depends on how many stars are
