Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux1/flux2.

Wait, first, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy. The pp-III branch must be a specific part of that chain. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton joins to form helium-3, and then two helium-3s combine into helium-4. But the pp-II and pp-III are less dominant. Oh wait, the pp-III branch involves reactions where a helium-3 captures a helium-4 to form carbon-12, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's a different step.

But the question is about neutrinos. The Sun emits neutrinos primarily through the proton-proton chain, and the main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the fusion process. The majority of neutrinos come from the pp chain, specifically the branch where two protons collide to form deuterium and then eventually form helium, emitting neutrinos along the way.

If the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Oh, the pp-III branch probably produces a specific range of neutrino energies. Wait, the neutrinos from the Sun are emitted during the fusion steps. The dominant neutrinos are from the decay of boron-8, which has a higher energy, around 15-18 MeV. But then, the lower-energy neutrinos come from other steps, like the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos around 1-2 MeV, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the dominant neutrinos from the main pp chain are the ones from the boron-8 decay, which has a peak around 15 MeV. But wait, wait, I think I need to get the neutrino energy distribution right.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. If that's the case, stopping it would reduce the flux of high-energy neutrinos but not the lower ones.

But the question is about two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Wait, keV? That's kilo-electron volts. Wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV. I thought most solar neutrinos are much higher energy than that. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the sources.

Wait, I remember that the solar neutrino spectrum has a peak around 1 MeV (or a bit higher) from the pep branch, and higher energy from the main pp chain. So the main neutrinos are from the boron-8 decay at around 15-18 MeV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is lower than the pep branch's peak. Hmm, so perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the pep branch, and 800-900 is maybe the lower end of the main pp chain's neutrinos.

Wait, but the main neutrinos are from the main pp chain (boron-8, higher energy), and the pep branch is a minor contributor with lower energy. So if the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain. Let me think: the pp chain has the main branch (pp-I), the pp-II, and pp-III. The main pp chain produces boron-8, which decays into two protons and a carbon-16, releasing a neutrino in the process. So if the pp-III branch stops, perhaps it's a secondary process that produces a different energy of neutrinos.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a specific part of the chain that produces a certain energy of neutrinos. Let me try to think. The main pp chain produces Beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become Boron-8. Boron-8 then emits a neutrino when it decays into Lithium-7 and two protons. The neutrino energy from this decay is about 15 MeV on average. So if the pp-III branch stops, would that affect the higher-energy neutrinos?

Wait, the question is about neutrinos in the 700 keV to 900 keV range. Which is way lower than 15 MeV. So maybe those neutrinos come from a different process.

Ah, the pep branch! The proton-electron-proton branch. In the pep branch, two protons and an electron interact to produce a helium-2 (which is a deuteron), and another proton. This process emits a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is lower, around 1-2 MeV. So, if the pp-III branch stops, does that affect the pep branch?

Wait, but the pep branch is a separate branch. If only the pp-III branch stops, the other reactions continue. So, if the main pp chain is still active, then the boron-8 neutrinos are still being produced. The pep branch is a minor contributor, but if the pp-III is stopped, would that affect the production of neutrinos in lower energy ranges?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for a specific part of the neutrino spectrum. If the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of higher-energy neutrinos would drop, but the lower-energy (pep branch) would remain the same.

Wait, but the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So those are both in the lower MeV range, 0.7-0.9 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. Wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, and 900 keV is 0.9 MeV. So both bands are around 1 MeV.

Wait, but the pep branch neutrinos are around 1-2 MeV, so 700 keV is at the lower end of that. So perhaps in the scenario where the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos (like 800-900 keV) would be affected more than the lower ones.

Wait, no. If the pp-III branch is stopped, perhaps it's responsible for producing neutrinos in the higher end of the 0.7-0.9 MeV range? Or maybe the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the overall neutrino flux in that energy range.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So before the stoppage, the pp-III was contributing to the neutrino flux. Now, it's stopped. So if the pp-III was producing neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV), then the flux in band 2 would decrease, while band 1 (700-800 keV) might be less affected, depending on where the neutrinos come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, so stopping it would cause a decrease in the higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure of the pp chain. The main pp chain (pp-I) produces boron-8. The pp-II branch involves the capture of a helium-3 by a helium-3 to form carbon-12, but I think the pp-III branch might involve something else, perhaps involving boron or other isotopes.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a part of the chain that produces neutrinos at these lower energies. For example, the initial steps of the pp chain, which might involve lower-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact details of the pp branches and their contributions to neutrino energies. Maybe I should think about the general behavior of the solar neutrino flux.

If the pp-III branch stops, which part of the neutrino spectrum is affected? Suppose that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in the higher energy part of the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So band 2 (800-900 keV) is in the higher part of that. If the pp-III is stopped, then the sources for this higher energy neutrinos are gone, so the flux in band 2 would drop, while band 1 (700-800 keV) might not be as affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't contribute much to the neutrino flux in that energy range, so the flux in band 2 could decrease more than band 1.

Wait, but I'm not too confident. Let me think about the overall neutrino flux. The main source is the boron-8 neutrinos at around 15 MeV. Then there's the pep branch at around 1-2 MeV. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is below that, which is lower than the pep branch. Is there another process?

Wait, maybe the neutrinos from the decay of Be-7? Because Be-7 is produced in the pp chain and captures a proton to become boron-8. Be-7 has a half-life of about 53 days, so it's not the main source of neutrinos. Wait, Be-7 itself doesn't emit neutrinos, but when it captures a proton to become boron-8, that process emits a neutrino. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range come from the main pp chain, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the neutrinos depends on the mass of the parent nucleus. For example, in the main pp chain, the neutrino energy is determined by the mass difference between boron-8 and lithium-7. The mass difference is about 10.8 MeV (since boron-8 is about 8.966 MeV/c², and lithium-7 is about 7.805 MeV/c²). So the neutrino energy would be about 0.9 MeV? No, wait, that can't be. Because boron-8 has a mass of about 8.966, lithium-7 is 7.805, so the difference is about 1.16 MeV. So the neutrino energy would be approximately 1.16 MeV. Oh wait, wait, but that's the standard neutrino energy for the main pp chain. So, the neutrinos emitted are about 1.16 MeV on average.

Wait, that would make sense. So the main pp chain produces neutrinos around 1 MeV. So the 700-800 keV band is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is below the main neutrino energy. Hmm, maybe the distribution of energies is such that the neutrinos are mainly around 1 MeV, with a tail extending lower. So 700 keV is lower than that, perhaps in the lower part of the distribution.

But if the pp-III branch stopped, would that affect the production of these neutrinos?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is part of the process that produces the main neutrinos, so stopping it would reduce the flux of the main neutrinos. But if the main neutrinos are around 1 MeV, then the 800-900 keV band (0.8-0.9 MeV) is just below that. So if the pp-III branch is a primary source of the 1 MeV neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the higher end of the neutrino flux.

Wait, but the neutrino flux from the Sun is such that the majority is around 1 MeV, but there's a distribution. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the higher-energy neutrinos (closer to 1 MeV) would decrease more than the lower ones.

But in our case, the bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9). So band 2 is higher energy than band 1. If the pp-III branch is stopped and it's responsible for producing the higher-energy neutrinos, then the flux in band 2 would be lower. So the ratio (band1 / band2) would be larger than 1, maybe 10 or something.

Wait, but what's the expected distribution? If the main neutrino energy is around 1 MeV, the flux drops off as you go to lower energies. So the number of neutrinos in 0.7-0.8 MeV is less than in 0.8-0.9 MeV. Wait, no, actually, if the peak is around 1 MeV, the flux would be higher as you approach that peak. So 0.7-0.8 would have lower flux than 0.8-0.9, which is closer to the peak.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, which might be responsible for a significant contribution in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range, then the flux in band 2 would drop, while band 1 remains. So the ratio would be band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) over band2 (0.8-0.9). If band2's flux drops more, then the ratio flux1/flux2 would be higher. For example, if band2's flux was previously similar to band1, and now it's lower, the ratio increases.

Wait, but without knowing the exact contribution, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos in the higher energy part of the spectrum. So if it stops, the higher energy neutrinos decrease, making the flux in band2 lower. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be higher.

Assuming that before the stoppage, the flux in band2 (800-900) was similar to band1 (700-800), but after pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to, say, 10% of its original, then the ratio would be about 10.

In that case, the ratio would be about 10, so option A.

But wait, if pp-III was a minor contributor, then the ratio might not change as much. Alternatively, if band2's flux was entirely from pp-III, then after stopping, band2's flux would drop to zero, making the ratio infinite. But that's not an option. So perhaps the pp-III only contributes a part of the band2 flux.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. So the neutrinos we detect now would be from the reactions that have been ongoing since then. The pp-III stopped, so any neutrinos that come from that process would stop as well. So the flux from pp-III's neutrinos would drop to zero, while other sources remain.

But I'm not sure how much of the flux in these bands comes from the pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp chain produces neutrinos at a certain energy, and the pp-III branch is a minor contributor that produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the higher-energy part of the neutrino spectrum (like the 800-900 keV band) would have a lower flux. So the flux in band 2 drops.

But without knowing the exact numbers, I have to make an educated guess.

Another angle: The neutrino flux from the Sun is dominated by the main pp chain, which produces neutrinos around 1 MeV. If the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, perhaps in the same energy range, so stopping it would reduce the flux in that range. So the 800-900 keV band is close to the peak, so without the pp-III, that band's flux would be lower than the 700-800 keV band.

Wait, but if the peak is around 1 MeV, the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9) is lower than the peak. So the main flux is higher in higher energies. If the pp-III was contributing a part of that, then the flux in band 2 would drop more, making the ratio flux1/flux2 higher.

Alternatively, maybe the main pp chain produces a broad spectrum, with a peak around 1 MeV. So the neutrino flux decreases as you go to lower energies, but the tail extends into 0.7-0.8 MeV. If the pp-III was producing neutrinos in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range, then stopping it would make that part of the spectrum drop more.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So the possible ratios are either 1, 10, 0.1, or 1/100.

If the flux in band 1 is higher than band 2 after the stoppage, then the ratio would be greater than 1. If band 1 is lower, the ratio would be less than 1.

If the pp-III branch was producing a lot of neutrinos in band 2, then after stopping, band 2 flux decreases, perhaps more than band 1. So if band1 was similar to band2 before, and band2 drops to 10% of its original, then band1/band2 would be 10. So option A.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: The pp-III branch is responsible for a higher-energy neutrino emission. So when it stops, the higher energy bands (like band2) would see a decrease in flux more than the lower bands (band1). So the ratio flux1/flux2 would be higher than 1.

If originally, the flux in band1 and band2 were similar, then after the pp-III stops, band2 flux drops, making the ratio flux1/flux2 about 10.

So the answer would be A) 10.


The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the flux of solar neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The goal is to determine the ratio of the flux in these bands, Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2), after the pp-III branch stops.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production in the Sun**:  
   The Sun's neutrino flux is primarily produced by the proton-proton (pp) chain. The main pp branch (pp-I) produces boron-8, which decays into lithium-7 and emits neutrinos with energies around 1 MeV. The pep branch produces lower-energy neutrinos (1-2 MeV), and the pp-III branch is a specific part of the pp chain that contributes neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:  
   The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in the higher-energy part of the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, particularly in band 2 (800-900 keV). If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 will decrease more significantly compared to band 1 (700-800 keV), as the latter may still receive contributions from other processes or remaining parts of the pp chain.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the Stoppage**:  
   Before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 and band 2 may have been similar. However, after the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 decreases more significantly, leading to an increase in the ratio Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2). Based on the expected reduction in band 2 flux, the ratio is estimated to be approximately 10.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the flux between the two bands, Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2), is approximately **10** after the pp-III branch stops.
