Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic physics can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, okay, so relativistic speeds mean I can't just use classical mechanics formulas. For relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds, I remember there's a formula from special relativity. Oh right, the velocity addition formula. Because when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't just subtract the velocities normally.

So the formula for relative velocity u' when one frame is moving at velocity v relative to another is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, but wait—wait, wait. Let me get that straight. If object A is moving at u in one frame, and the other frame is moving at velocity v relative to the first, what's the speed of A in the second frame? Right, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Oh wait, no, wait a second—is it (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) or the other way around? I think I might have it backwards. Because if the second frame is moving at velocity v relative to the first, then the formula for transforming u from the first frame to the second is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference of their speeds divided by that denominator.

Wait, but wait. Wait, both astronauts are moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of the first astronaut (say, the one with speed 0.6c), the second astronaut (0.5c) would have a relative speed of (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

Calculating the numerator:
