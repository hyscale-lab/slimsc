Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do v1 - v2. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula is: u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, is that when you're changing frames or when one is moving relative to the other? Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait no, wait. Wait, the relative speed would be how fast one is moving with respect to the other. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c -0.6c) = negative 0.1c? But that's not possible because you can't just subtract in relativity. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. So if frame S' is moving at velocity u relative to S, then the velocity v as observed in S is given by (v' + u)/(1 + (u v')/c²). But wait, in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So if I want to find the relative speed of B as seen from A, I have to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, so in the lab frame, A's speed is u_A = 0.6c and B's speed is u_B = 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B?

So using the formula, v = (u_B - u_A)/(1 - (u_B u_A)/c² )

Plugging in the numbers: (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² )

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.5 - 0.6 = -0.1 → -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857 c. So the relative speed is about 0.142857 c, but since speed is a magnitude, it's 0.142857 c. Wait, but the options have 0.14c and 0.1c. So that would be approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, right? So that rules out some options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel of 0.14c. Options A and B have different values. So with that, the relative speed part is about 0.14c. So possible answers are C and D.

Now, the total energy of the system. So each astronaut has relativistic energy, and the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. Oh wait, but in relativity, the total energy also includes rest mass energy. But the problem says 'the total energy of the system'—so probably the sum of their relativistic energies.

So the
