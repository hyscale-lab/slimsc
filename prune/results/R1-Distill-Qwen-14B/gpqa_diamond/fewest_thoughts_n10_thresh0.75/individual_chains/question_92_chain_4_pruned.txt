Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation... I remember that's the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Right. The formula for this usually involves bond energies and the atoms involved.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. It looks like it's a diene, maybe with some branching. Oh wait, it's a molecule with multiple double bonds or just one? Let me count the double bonds. I see two double bonds: each C=C. So it's something like a conjugated diene or maybe isolated.

Now, the data given are the enthalpy of atomization of carbon (1000 kJ/mol), bond energies for H-H (100), C-C (200), C=C (300), and C-H (400). Oh, wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of gaseous molecules into their atoms. So for carbon, each bond requires 1000 kJ/mol to break all bonds into C atoms.

So to find the enthalpy of formation, I think I need to calculate the total bond energies of all bonds in the molecule and then relate that to the formation from elements. The formula I
