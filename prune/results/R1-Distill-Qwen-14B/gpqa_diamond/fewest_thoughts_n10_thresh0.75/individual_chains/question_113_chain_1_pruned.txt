Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Hmm, I remember that various spectroscopic techniques can give clues about the structure, so let's go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So this suggests the compound has an alcohol group or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a very broad peak might be more indicative of an alcohol (like O-H from an -OH group), but a carboxylic acid's O-H is usually even broader and maybe a bit lower in wavenumber, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be an amine, but the options don't include nitrogen, so probably not.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or maybe esters. The 1650 is a bit lower, which might suggest something like conjugated carbonyls. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group or maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, that 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substituents. Oh, but wait, 1650 is also in the range of conjugated carbonyls or maybe an amide, but again, no N in the options. So probably, it's a ketone or ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group.

The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule has at least one double bond. That suggests maybe an alkene group is present, which could be part of a conjugated system with the carbonyl.

Now, looking at the Mass Spectrometry data: there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think: 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is ether (molecular weight 45). Or maybe CH2O (formaldehyde, but that's 30). Or perhaps it's a fragment from a larger group. Wait, another possibility is that it's the methyl group (CH3) and something else. Alternatively, the m/z=45 often corresponds to the (CH3)2O fragment, which is an ether group.

Additionally, considering the molecular formulas, let's think about degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since all options have no X or N, it's (2C + 2 - H)/2.

Let's calculate for each:
