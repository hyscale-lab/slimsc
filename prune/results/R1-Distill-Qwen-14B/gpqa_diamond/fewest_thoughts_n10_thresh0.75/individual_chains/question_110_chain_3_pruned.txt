Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the brightness of a star, as measured by its apparent magnitude, determines whether it can be observed by a particular instrument. The question gives some info about the magnitude limits of each spectrograph. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to figure out the apparent V magnitude for each star because both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different brightness thresholds. The links provided probably give more info about the telescopes, but the question simplifies things by saying to ignore pointing limits and altitude, so I just focus on magnitudes.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. So, apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16, so apparent mag ≤16. Wait, no, actually, wait—no, the problem says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, which I think means it can detect up to that. Or do I have it backwards? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with apparent magnitude up to 17. Because anything brighter (smaller mag number) is okay. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V ≤17. For HIRES, apparent V ≤16. So a star must be bright enough to be detected by both, meaning its apparent mag must be ≤16 because HIRES is more restrictive. So any star with apparent mag ≤16 can be seen by both. Wait, no. Because if a star is at 16, HIRES can see it (since it's brighter than 16?), but ESPRESSO can also see it because 16 is less than 17. So both can see stars up to 16. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the stars must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be seen by both, because that's the stricter limit.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed.
