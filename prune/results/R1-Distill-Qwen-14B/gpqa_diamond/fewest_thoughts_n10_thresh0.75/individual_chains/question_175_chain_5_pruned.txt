Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal and radiates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is oscillating and is spheroid-shaped, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The question is asking about two things: the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f, which is the function of lambda.

The options are A to D, each with a fraction and a power dependence on lambda.

I remember that when a dipole radiates, the radiation pattern is in the far field, and the power radiated depends on the angle. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (theta = 90 degrees), and decreases towards the poles (theta=0 or 180). The radiation pattern for a dipole is something like sin^2(theta), so maximum at theta=90.

Wait, but here the charge distribution is spheroidal. So perhaps it's a quadrupole or something else? Or maybe it's an oscillating dipole? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, the question says it's an oscillating charge distribution, which probably means it's acting as a dipole antenna, since dipoles are common oscillating charges.

So for a dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle at an angle theta is proportional to sin^2(theta) in the far field. Wait, but waitâ€”no, that's the direction of the radiation. Let me think again.

The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( ( (d^2) ) / (something) ) * sin^2(theta) * (some other terms). Or wait, the intensity or the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees, which would be perpendicular to the dipole's axis.

So if the maximum power A is at theta=90 degrees, then the power at theta=30 degrees would be lower.

Wait, the function f
