Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are between four compounds: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.

First, I need to understand what each of these compounds looks like. I remember that propenyl and butenyl are alkenyl groups. Acetate is an ester group, so all these compounds are esters with an alkene substituent.

So, propenyl would be a three-carbon group with a double bond, like CH₂CH=CH₂ but as an ester, maybe CH₂CH=CH-OAc or something similar. Wait, no, acetate esters have the structure R-O-COCH3. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH₂CH=CH-OAc, but wait, the propenyl group could be either cis or trans, depending on the substituents around the double bond.

Wait, wait. Let's think: propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂- but as an ester, perhaps it's CH₂CH=CH-OAc? Or is the double bond in a different position? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc, but acetate is OAc⁻, so the ester would be CH₂=CHCH₂-O-COCH3. But wait, propenyl is CH₂=CH₂CH2-, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So in propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc.

Similarly, butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon chain with a double bond. So for cis and trans butenyl, the double bond would be between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structures. Let me try drawing them mentally.

In any case, the key is to look at the NMR data given and see which structure matches.
