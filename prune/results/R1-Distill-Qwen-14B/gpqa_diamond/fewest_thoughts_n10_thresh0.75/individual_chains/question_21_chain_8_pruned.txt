Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about isomers and tautomerism, and optical isomerism. I should break it down step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, I need to understand what each term means. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures, usually through the movement of a hydrogen atom and the reorganization of double bonds. This often happens in compounds with conjugated systems, like in carbonyl groups. For example, in a diketone, if the molecule can shift a hydrogen from one oxygen to the other, it can form different tautomers. But if the structure prevents this, like having no adjacent protons or rigid structures, then tautomerism doesn't occur.

So, looking at the first part, the compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho depending on where the oxygens are. But in any case, it's a quinone structure. Quinones are known to undergo tautomerism because they have conjugated carbonyl groups. For example, para-benzoquinone can tautomerize into hydroquinone, which is a diol structure. So benzoquinone does show tautomerism. Therefore, if the question is about which doesn't show tautomerism, benzoquinone is not it. So the other compound, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, is the candidate.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring. Wait, but for tautomerism, you need adjacent carbonyl groups or a conjugated system. Let me think. Tautomerism in a diketone occurs when there's a conjugated di-ketone, like in 1,3-cyclohexanedione. Because the structure allows for the movement of a hydrogen from one oxygen to the other, creating a conjugated system. So for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the three ketone groups are at every other carbon. So it's 1,3,5 positions on a six-membered ring.

Wait, in a 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by a single bond. So, for example, the structure would be O=C-O-C-O-C-O, but in a cyclohexane ring. Wait, no, the actual structure is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each is separated by two carbons.

Hmm, does this allow for tautomerism? Because tautomerism requires that a hydrogen can move from one oxygen to another, which involves some conjugation or proximity. In the case of 1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a carbon that's
