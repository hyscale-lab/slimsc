Okay, so I've got this problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is measured to be θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants involved, but I think the area comes first.

So, first step, I need to find the radius of the event horizon to get the area. The event horizon radius R is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula, R = 2 G M / c^2. But wait, maybe I can find R from the angular size and the distance. Because angular size θ relates to the actual size R via θ ≈ R/d, assuming θ is in radians and small, so the approximation holds.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert that to radians first. Let me compute that. θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). So θ = 1e-17 degrees. Let me compute θ_rad:

θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Hmm, that's a very small angle, which makes sense for a distant galaxy.

So, using the small angle approximation, R ≈ d * θ_rad. Wait, actually, the formula is R = d * θ_rad. So R equals distance multiplied by theta in radians.

Wait, no, I think the formula is θ ≈ R/d, so rearranged, R ≈ d * θ. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The angular diameter θ (in radians) is equal to R/d. So R = θ_rad * d.

Yes, that's right. So I can calculate R as θ_rad multiplied by the distance d.

Wait, but d is given as 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert that into meters because the Schwarzschild radius is in meters. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m. Let me compute that.

d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters. Hmm, that's a big number.

So R = θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19 rad) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26. Let me calculate that: 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.38, and then 10^(-19 + 26) is 10^7. So R ≈ 5.38e7 meters. Or about 5.4e7 meters.

Wait, that seems a bit large. Wait, 5.4e7 meters is 54 million meters, which is 54,000 kilometers. Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius for a solar mass is about 3 km. So if R is 54,000 km, that would be a black hole with mass M = R/(2 G/c²) * c²/(G). Wait, maybe I should compute the mass first.

Wait, Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c^2. So rearranged, M = R_s c²/(2 G). Let me plug in the numbers.

R_s is about 5.4e7 meters. Let me compute M.

M = (5.4e7 m) * (c^2) / (2 G).

Wait, c is about 3e8 m/s. c squared is (9e16 m²/s²).

G is 6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So,

M = (5.4e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 * 6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 6.674e-11 ≈ 1.3348e-10 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So the numerator is 5.4e7 * 9e16 = 4.86e24 m³/s².

Divide numerator by denominator: (4.86e24) / (1.3348e-10) ) = approximately 3.637e34 kg.

Wait, that's 3.6e34 kg. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 5.4e7 * 9e16 = 5.4 * 9 = 48.6; 1e7 *1e16=1e23; so 48.6e23 = 4.86e24. Then 4.86e24 divided by 1.3348e-10 is 4.86e24 / 1.3348e-10 ≈ 3.637e34 kg.

Wait, the Sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So 3.6e34 kg is 3.6e4 times more massive, so about 3.6e4 solar masses. That's 36,000 solar masses, which seems plausible for a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy.

But wait, let me make sure I did the calculation correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me compute R_s again. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, θ is 1e-17 degrees. So θ_deg = 1e-17.

Convert to radians: θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then R = θ_rad * d. d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = let's compute 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e(26-19) = ~5.38 * 1e7 = 5.38e7 meters. So R = 5.38e7 m.

So, R_s = 5.38e7 m. Then M = R_s c²/(2 G).

Wait, let's compute that again:

M = (5.38e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 * 6.674e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 5.38e7 * 9e16 = (5.38 * 9) = 48.42; exponents 1e7 * 1e16 = 1e23. So 48.42e23 = 4.842e24.

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

So M = (4.842e24 m³/s²) ) / (1.3348e-10 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Wait, let me check the units. The numerator is [m * m²/s²] = m³/s². The denominator is [m³/(kg s²)]. So when we divide, units become (m³/s²) * (kg s²)/(m³) ) ) = kg. So that's correct.

So M = 4.842e24 / 1.3348e-10 = let's compute 4.842e24 / 1.3348e-10 = 4.842 / 1.3348 ≈ 3.626, and 1e24 / 1e-10 = 1e34. So M ≈3.626e34 kg.

So that's 3.6e34 kg, which is 3.6e4 solar masses (since Sun is 2e30 kg), so 3.6e4 * 2e30 = 7.2e34 kg? Wait, wait, no: no, because 3.6e34 kg divided by 2e30 kg per solar mass is 3.6e34 / 2e30 = 1.8e4 solar masses, which is 18,000 solar masses. Hmm, that's a bit on the lower side for a supermassive black hole, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of M. Let me recompute the numbers more accurately.

Compute 5.38e7 m * 9e16 m²/s² = 5.38e7 *9e16 = 4.842e24 m³/s².

Divide by (2 *6.674e-11) = 1.3348e-10.

So 4.842e24 / 1.3348e-10 = 4.842e24 / 1.3348e-10 = (4.842 /1.3348) ) * 1e34.

4.842 /1.3348 ≈ 3.628.

So M ≈3.628e34 kg.

Which is 3.628e34 / 2e30 = 1.814e4 solar masses.

So about 18,140 solar masses. That's a medium-sized supermassive black hole; typical ones are millions to billions of solar masses. But maybe it's correct for this problem.

Now, having found the mass, I can compute the entropy.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Alternatively, another way to write it is S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (A), but perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula in terms of mass.

Wait, another approach: S = ( (1/4) ) ( A c^3 )/( ħ G k_B )

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), which is the same as (A/(4 l_p^2)), where l_p is the Planck length, since l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ).

So perhaps it's easier to compute the area A.

The area A of the event horizon is 4 π R_s^2. Since R_s is 5.38e7 m.

So A =4 * π * (5.38e7 m)^2.

Compute that: (5.38e7)^2 = (5.38)^2 * 1e14 = 28.9444 * 1e14 = 2.89444e15 m².

Multiply by 4 π: 4 * π * 2.89444e15 ≈ 12.0 * 2.89444e15 = 34.733e15 m², which is 3.473e16 m².

Wait, let me compute that again more accurately.

A =4 * π * (5.38e7)^2.

5.38e7 squared is (5.38)^2=28.9444, so 28.9444e14 = 2.89444e15 m².

Multiply by 4: 4 * 2.89444e15 = 1.157776e16 m². Multiply by π (approx 3.1416), so 1.157776e16 * 3.1416 ≈ 3.637e16 m².

So A ≈ 3.637e16 m².

Now, plug into the entropy formula.

S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B)

I think I should use the constants:

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

k_B is the Boltzmann constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So let's plug in the numbers.

S = (3.637e16 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3) / (4 * 1.05457e-34 J s * 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 * 1.380649e-23 J/K )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

First, numerator:

3.637e16 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 m³/s³.

So 3.637e16 * 27e24 = 3.637 *27 = 98.199; 1e16 *1e24 =1e40.

So numerator is 98.199e40 m^5/s^3.

Denominator:

4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute step by step.

First, 4 * 1.05457e-34 ≈4.218e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 ≈ 2.814e-44.

Multiply by 1.380649e-23: 2.814e-44 *1.38e-23 = approx 3.885e-67.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Compute each multiplication step by step:

4 * 1.05457e-34 = 4 * 1.05457 =4.21828e-34.

Then 4.21828e-34 * 6.6743e-11 = let's multiply 4.21828 *6.6743 ≈ 28.15, and exponents -34 + (-11) = -45.

So 28.15e-45 = 2.815e-44.

Now, 2.815e-44 * 1.380649e-23 = 2.815 *1.380649 ≈ 3.885e-67.

So denominator is 3.885e-67.

Putting it all together: S = (98.199e40) / (3.885e-67) ) * (m^5/s^3) / (J s m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 J/K) ) Wait, no, units might get complicated, but perhaps since we're just dealing with orders of magnitude, I can focus on the numerical value.

Wait, wait, the denominator is 3.885e-67, and the numerator is 98.199e40.

So S ≈ 98.199e40 / 3.885e-67.

Compute 98.199 /3.885 ≈25.26.

And 1e40 /1e-67 =1e107.

So S ≈25.26e107 → 2.526e108 J/K.

Wait, but wait, let me recompute that division.

Wait, 98.199e40 is 9.8199e41.

Wait, no, 98.199e40 is 9.8199e1 *1e40 =9.8199e41.

Wait, no, 98.199e40 → 9.8199e1 *1e40 →9.8199e41.

Wait, 98.199e40 = 9.8199e41.

Divided by 3.885e-67: 9.8199e41 / 3.885e-67 = (9.8199 /3.885) *1e(41 +67) → approx 2.526 *1e108 → 2.526e108 J/K.

Wait, that's entropy S ≈2.5e108 J/K.

But wait, checking the options, the options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66.

Hmm, this doesn't match any of them. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Maybe I messed up a step in the exponents.

Wait, let me go back to the calculation of the area.

A =4 pi R^2, where R is 5.38e7 meters.

So R^2 = (5.38e7)^2 = (5.38)^2 =28.9444, and 1e14 (since (1e7)^2=1e14). So 28.9444e14 =2.89444e15 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416 ≈12.566. So 12.566 *2.89444e15 ≈3.638e16 m².

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the entropy formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, let me recompute the denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Wait, 4 * ħ * G * k_B = 4 * (1.05457e-34) * (6.6743e-11) * (1.380649e-23).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.21828e-34.

Then multiply by 6.6743e-11:

4.21828e-34 *6.6743e-11 = ?

Compute 4.21828 *6.6743 ≈28.15.

Exponents: 1e-34 *1e-11=1e-45. So 28.15e-45 =2.815e-44.

Now multiply by 1.380649e-23:

2.815e-44 *1.380649e-23 = (2.815 *1.380649) ≈3.884e-67.

So denominator is 3.884e-67.

Numerator is A * c^3 =3.638e16 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

(3e8)^3=27e24 =2.7e25 m³/s³.

Wait, no: 3e8^3 is (3)^3=27, and (1e8)^3=1e24. So 27e24 m³/s³ = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

Wait, no, 3e8 is 3*1e8, so (3e8)^3 is 27*(1e8)^3=27e24 =2.7e25.

So A*c^3 =3.638e16 m² * 2.7e25 m³/s³ =3.638 *2.7 =9.8226e16+25=9.8226e41 m^5/s^3.

So numerator is 9.8226e41 m^5/s^3.

Denominator is 3.884e-67.

So S = (9.8226e41) / (3.884e-67) ) * units, but perhaps I'm missing something because the units may not quite work out. But focusing on the magnitude:

9.8226e41 /3.884e-67 = (9.8226 /3.884) ) * 1e(41 +67) =approx 2.527 * 1e108 → 2.527e108 J/K.

But the options are nowhere near this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for entropy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area, or other steps.

Wait, another approach: the entropy of a black hole is also given by S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G). But perhaps I should consider the formula in terms of the Schwarzschild radius R_s=2 G M /c^2 and express S in terms of R_s.

Wait, R_s = 2 G M / c² → M = R_s c²/(2 G).

But S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G) = (k_B c^3 *4 pi R_s² )/(4 ħ G) ) → simplifies to (k_B c^3 pi R_s² )/( ħ G )

Wait, let me compute that.

So S = (pi R_s² c^3 k_B )/( ħ G )

Let me plug in the numbers.

R_s =5.38e7 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

G=6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So S = ( pi * (5.38e7)^2 * (3e8)^3 * 1.38e-23 ) / ( 1.05457e-34 *6.674e-11 )

Compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator:

pi * (5.38e7)^2 = pi * 28.944e14 = pi * 2.8944e15 ≈ 9.09e15.

Multiply by (3e8)^3 = 2.7e24: 9.09e15 *2.7e24 = 24.54e39 =2.454e40.

Multiply by 1.38e-23: 2.454e40 *1.38e-23 =3.402e17.

Denominator: 1.05457e-34 *6.674e-11 = 7.03e-45.

So S = (3.402e17) / (7.03e-45) ) → (3.402/7.03) ) * 1e62 → approx 0.484 *1e62 →4.84e61 J/K.

Wait, that's 4.84e61 J/K, which is about 1e62. So the order of magnitude is 1e62 J/K. So the answer would be option A) 1e62.

Wait, but earlier I got 2.5e108 J/K, which is way bigger than any of the options. So where did I go wrong?

Ah! I think I messed up the formula earlier. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) → is that right? Because the units have to come out in J/K.

Wait, let me check the units:

A is in m².

c^3 is m³/s³.

ħ has units J s = (kg m²/s²) s = kg m²/s.

G has units m³/(kg s²).

k_B is J/K, which is kg m²/(s² K).

So let's compute the units of the entropy formula:

(A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B )

= (m² * m³/s³) ) / ( [kg m²/s] [m³/(kg s²)] [kg m²/(s² K)] )

Simplify numerator: m^5/s^3.

Denominator:

[ kg m^2/s ] * [ m^3/(kg s^2) ] = (kg m^5)/(s^3 kg) ) = m^5/s^3.

Then times [kg m^2/(s² K)] → (m^5/s^3) * kg m^2/(s² K) ) → kg m^7/(s^5 K).

So overall, numerator is m^5/s^3.

Denominator is kg m^7/(s^5 K).

So the overall units are (m^5/s^3) * (s^5 K)/(kg m^7) ) = (K s^2) / (kg m^2).

But J is kg m²/s² → so K is J/(kg m²/s²) → K = J s²/(kg m²).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on units. Maybe I should just trust that the formula is correct and focus on the calculation.

Wait, in the second approach I did, I got S ≈4.8e61 J/K, which is 1e62. So option A is 1e62.

But earlier I had 2.5e108, which must have been a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in the first approach I forgot that the area is 4 pi R^2, while in the second approach I included it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the exponents in the first approach. Let me recheck.

In the first approach, after computing the numerator as 9.8e41 and denominator 3.88e-67, I have S=9.8e41 /3.88e-67 = (9.8 /3.88) *1e(41 +67) → approx 2.528e108.

But in the second approach, using the formula S = (pi R^2 c^3 k_B )/( ħ G ), I got 4.8e61, which is 1e62.

Wait, but the two approaches should give the same answer. So perhaps I messed up the first approach.

Wait, in the first approach, I used S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B). So A is 4 pi R^2. Let me plug A =4 pi R^2 into the first formula.

So S = (4 pi R^2 c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B) ) = (pi R^2 c^3) / ( ħ G k_B )

Which is same as the second approach. So that's correct.

But in the first calculation, I must have made a mistake in the numerator.

Wait, let me recompute using the second approach:

A =4 pi R^2 → 4 *3.1416 * (5.38e7)^2 → 3.638e16 m².

c^3 = (3e8)^3 =2.7e24 m³/s³.

So A c^3 =3.638e16 *2.7e24 =9.82e40.

4 ħ G k_B =4 *1.054e-34 *6.674e-11 *1.38e-23 → let me compute that:

4 *1.054e-34 =4.216e-34.

4.216e-34 *6.674e-11 = 2.814e-44.

2.814e-44 *1.38e-23 =3.885e-67.

So S =9.82e40 /3.885e-67 =2.528e107 J/K.

Wait, but that's 2.5e107, which is 1e107.

But in the second approach, I thought I got 4.8e61, which is 1e62.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the second approach.

Wait, in the second approach, when I computed the numerator as 3.402e17 and denominator 7.03e-45, the division gave me 4.84e61.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation. Let me recompute.

Numerator in second approach: pi * R^2 * c^3 *k_B.

pi * (5.38e7)^2 →3.638e16 m².

Multiply by c^3 (2.7e24 m³/s³): 3.638e16 *2.7e24 =9.822e40.

Multiply by k_B (1.38e-23 J/K):9.822e40 *1.38e-23 = (9.822 *1.38)=13.54e17 →1.354e18.

Denominator: ħ G → (1.054e-34 J s) * (6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) )=7.03e-45 J m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻¹.

So S = (1.354e18 J m² ) / (7.03e-45 J m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻¹ ) → Wait, perhaps my units are getting mixed up, but focusing on the numbers:

1.354e18 /7.03e-45 =1.928e62.

Wait, 1e18 /1e-45 is 1e63. So 1.354e18 /7.03e-45 = (1.354/7.03) ) *1e(18+45) → approx 0.1928 *1e63 →1.928e62 J/K.

Which is about 1.9e62 J/K. So the order of magnitude is 1e62, which is option A.

Which matches the first approach if I messed up the first calculation, perhaps. Wait, no, the first approach gave 2.5e107, which is way off. So I must have made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, in the first approach, I think I used the wrong formula. Let me clarify the correct formula.

The correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ).

Wait, but in some references, it's written as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G ), which matches what I did in the second approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot the k_B in the first approach. So in the first approach, I might have missed a factor. Let me re-express the first approach correctly.

Ah! I see. In the first approach, I wrote S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), which would include k_B in the denominator. But in the second approach, I included k_B in the numerator.

Wait, which is correct?

Wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) → no, I think I'm getting confused.

Let me look up the correct formula. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, no, actually, the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(k_B )) ) → perhaps I have to include k_B in the denominator.

Wait, no, let me double-check. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ), but according to the references, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B ) → no, perhaps it's (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) multiplied by k_B.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about dimensional analysis.

The entropy S has units of J/K.

A is m².

c^3 is m³/s³.

ħ is J s → kg m²/s.

G is m³/(kg s²).

k_B is J/K → kg m²/(s² K).

So,

[A c^3] = m² * m³/s³ = m^5/s^3.

Denominator: 4 ħ G k_B → [ kg m²/s ] * [ m³/(kg s²) ] * [ kg m²/(s² K) ] → let's compute this.

First, (kg m²/s) * (m³/(kg s²)) )= (kg m^5)/(s^3 kg s^2) ) → m^5/(s^5).

Multiply by (kg m²/(s² K)) → (m^5/(s^5)) * (kg m²/(s² K)) )= kg m^7/(s^7 K).

So the denominator has units kg m^7/(s^7 K).

The numerator is m^5/s^3.

So overall, the units are (m^5/s^3) / (kg m^7/(s^7 K)) ) = (K s^4 )/(kg m^2).

But J is kg m²/s², so K is J/(kg m²/s² ) = (kg m²/s² K^{-1} s² ) ) → kg m²/(s² K).

Hmm, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me perhaps instead refer to the correct formula as S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), which would give me units of J/K.

Because:

k_B → J/K.

c^3 → m³/s³.

A → m².

So numerator: (J/K) * (m³/s³) * m² → J m^5/(K s^3).

Denominator: 4 ħ G → (J s) * (m³/kg s^2 ) → J m^3/(kg s).

So overall, J m^5/(K s^3) ÷ ( J m^3/(kg s) ) → (kg s) m^5/( m^3 K s^3 ) ) → kg m²/(s^2 K).

Which is (kg m²/s^2 ) → which is J. So J/(K) → correct units for entropy.

So the correct formula is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ).

Ah, so in my first approach, I think I forgot to include k_B in the numerator, which led to the mistake.

So in the first approach, the correct calculation should have included k_B in the numerator, which I didn't do, leading to an incorrect result.

So the correct calculation is as in the second approach, which gives me S ≈2e62 J/K.

So the order of magnitude is 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier in the second approach, with the correct formula, I got S ≈1.9e62 J/K, which is about 2e62. So the order of magnitude is 1e62.

So the answer should be option A) 1e62 J/K.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant.

### Step 1: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (\(R_s\))
The Schwarzschild radius is given by:

\[
R_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}
\]

However, since the angular size of the event horizon (\(\theta\)) and the distance (\(d\)) are provided, we can approximate \(R_s\) using the small-angle formula:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{R_s}{d}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
R_s = \theta \cdot d
\]

The angular size is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\), which must be converted to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The distance to the galaxy is \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs}\). Converting parsecs to meters:

\[
d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now calculate \(R_s\):

\[
R_s = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.38 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the event horizon (\(A\))
The area of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2
\]

Substituting \(R_s = 5.38 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}\):

\[
A = 4 \pi (5.38 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot (2.894 \times 10^{15}) \approx 3.638 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy (\(S\))
Using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

Substitute the constants:
- \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\),
- \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\),
- \(G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}\),
- \(A = 3.638 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2\).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8)^3 \cdot (3.638 \times 10^{16})
\]

\[
(3.0 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{24}, \quad k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{24}) \cdot (3.638 \times 10^{16})
\]

\[
k_B c^3 A \approx 1.38 \cdot 2.7 \cdot 3.638 \times 10^{-23 + 24 + 16} \approx 12.0 \times 10^{17} = 1.2 \times 10^{18} \, \text{J m}^2.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.054 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11})
\]

\[
4 \hbar G \approx 4 \cdot 1.054 \cdot 6.674 \times 10^{-34 - 11} \approx 27.3 \times 10^{-45} = 2.73 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{J m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
\]

Now divide:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{18}}{2.73 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.4 \times 10^{61} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the order of magnitude
The entropy is approximately \(4.4 \times 10^{61} \, \text{J/K}\), which corresponds to an order of magnitude of \(10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\).

### Final Answer:
The order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole is:
