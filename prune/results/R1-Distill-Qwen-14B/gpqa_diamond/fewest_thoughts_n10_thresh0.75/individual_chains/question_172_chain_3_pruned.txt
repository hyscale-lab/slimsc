Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, okay. Let me try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of particles in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. Yeah, the formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ) where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy levels are E and E + delta E. Let's say the iron atoms are moving from a lower to higher energy level. So the ratio of the populations would be, say, the number in the higher level (n_upper) divided by the lower level (n_lower) equals exp( -delta_E/(k*T) ).

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe n_upper1/n_lower1 = 2. And for star_2, it's n_upper2/n_lower2 = 1, because star_1 is twice as excited. Or wait, perhaps it's that n_upper1 is twice n_upper2? Or maybe n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2*(n_upper2 / n_lower2)? Not sure, I
