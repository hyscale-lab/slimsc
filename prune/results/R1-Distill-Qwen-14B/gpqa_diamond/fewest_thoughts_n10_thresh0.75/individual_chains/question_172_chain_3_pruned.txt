Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with emission or excitation of atoms in stars, we often use something called the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that number looks familiar. 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is probably k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Wait, but wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So that implies that ΔE = k*T? Or maybe not, because if T is high, more thermal energy, but here the difference is set.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the two levels is known. So, the ratio of the populations (excited to ground state, perhaps) is given. In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio N1/N2 is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, for each star, we can model the excitation of their respective energy levels. So for each star, the number of atoms in the excited state (N_e) is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of N_e in star_1 to N_e in star_2 is 2. But wait, maybe it's the ratio of N_e/(N_ground) for each star. So, for each star, N_e/N_g = (g_e/g_g) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g_e and g_g are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels. But often,
