Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question, and honestly, I'm a bit confused at first glance. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question involves two decay processes. The first decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The second one is a variant where the decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V particles. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Hmm, the key point here is about the energy spectrum of the E particles. In the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum with an endpoint value Q. Now, the question is how this changes when the decay emits M instead of two V particles.

I remember that in nuclear decays, the type of emitted particles and their properties influence the energy spectrum of other decay products. For example, in beta decay, the electrons have a continuous spectrum because the process is governed by conservation laws like energy and momentum, but not just the rest mass energies.

Wait, in the first case, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So four particles are emitted: two E and two V. Since the E particles have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies aren't fixed but vary. But why is that the case? Oh right, because in multi-body decays, the different particles share the energy, and the possible energy distributions form a continuous range.

Now, when the decay changes to emitting one M instead of two V's, how does that affect E's spectrum?

Let me think about the conservation laws. Energy and momentum must be conserved. So, in the original decay, the four particles (two E, two V) carry off energy and momentum in various ways. But when we replace the two V's with a single M, which is massless, the situation changes.

Wait, M is massless and exotic. So, if M is massless, it's like a photon or a neutrino in that aspect. So M would have energy equal to its momentum times c (but since it's massless, E = pc). But how does that affect the decay?

In the original decay, the two V particles would have their own energies and momenta. If they're perhaps massive, like electrons or something else, their rest mass would play a role. But in the second case, M is massless, so it's like adding a photon to the decay products.

Wait, but the number of E particles is still two, right? So the decay products are 2B, 2E, and M. So the number of particles is different—originally four, now three.

In the first scenario with 2E and 2V, the E's have a continuous spectrum. Now, with 2E and 1M, what changes?

I think about the phase space and how the decay products can distribute energy. When you have more particles, the phase space is divided among more particles, leading to a different distribution.

But wait, the original question is about the E particles' spectrum. So perhaps the presence of the M affects how much energy each E can have.

In the original decay, the E particles
