Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable.

Wait, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a vector in a Hilbert space, so I guess this is a 3-dimensional vector. But wait, the components don't look normalized. I should probably normalize it first because probabilities depend on the squared magnitude of the components.

Wait, the observable is represented by matrix P. Let me look at P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. I think each row corresponds to a basis state, maybe the eigenstates of P?

Wait, but wait, the observable is P. So the matrix P is diagonal? Or is it not? Wait no, looking at the matrix elements, it's not diagonal. Let me see. The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So P is a matrix with 0 on the diagonal and non-zero elsewhere. That complicates things. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I don't need to find the eigenvalues here.

Wait, the question is about the probability of measuring 0. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, the possible outcomes when measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I should find the eigenvalues of P. Because the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is based on the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues of P. But wait, looking at P, it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = 
[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm. To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λI) and set it to zero.

So P - λI is:
[ -λ   1/√2   0
  1/√2 -λ   1/√2
   0   1/√2  -λ ]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious. Let me think about it.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
      - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ]
      + 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, because the third element in the first row is zero, the third term will be zero. So I only need to compute the first two terms.

Let me compute each part.

First term: -λ * [ (λ^2) - (1/2) ) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ ( -λ/√2 ) - 0 ] 

So putting it all together:

det = -λ (λ^2 -1/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2 )

Simplify each part:

First term: -λ^3 + (λ/2)

Second term: (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/(2)

So the determinant is:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ

Set this equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0
λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0

So the solutions are λ = 0, λ² = 1 → λ=1, -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of getting 0 when we measure the observable. So the eigenvalue 0 has a certain eigenspace, and the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto that eigenspace.

So, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 and then project the state onto that space.

But wait, if the eigenvalue is 0, the eigenvectors are the non-trivial solutions to (P - 0 I) v = 0, i.e., P v = 0.

Let me set up the system of equations for P v = 0.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 +0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 =0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the general solution is v = (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let me write this as v = v3*(-1, 0, 1) + any multiple. So the eigenvectors are multiples of (-1,0,1). So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (-1, 0, 1).

Wait, but wait, let me check that. Let me plug in this vector into P.

So vector v = (-1, 0, 1).

Pv = [0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 +0*(1) ] → 0 for first component.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1 → (-1 +1)/√2 = 0.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1) → 0.

So yes, P v = (0,0,0) → 0*v. So v is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, as I thought. Therefore, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the state in this eigenspace.

Wait, but the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this as a column vector ψ = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized, right? Because the sum of the squares of the amplitudes must be 1. Let me check that.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Therefore, the actual state is ψ_normalized = ψ / sqrt(6) = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

So the probability is the square of the inner product of ψ_normalized and the eigenvector u (which is (-1, 0, 1) up to a factor).

Wait, but the eigenvector u is (-1,0,1). Let me write it as a vector: u = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. To make it a unit vector, I need to normalize it. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is u_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

So the inner product between ψ_normalized and u_normalized is:

( (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) + ( (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 ) + ( (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ 1 + 1 ] / (sqrt(12) )

= 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → because sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3)

= 1/sqrt(3)

So the amplitude is 1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of this, which is (1/3).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the projection without normalizing the state, because the probability could be calculated as |<u | ψ>|^2 divided by the norm squared of ψ, but I think I've already normalized ψ, so that's correct.

So the probability is 1/3, which is option C.


To determine the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix operator \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The matrix \( P \) is given as:
\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After calculating the determinant, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenspace for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), solve \( P v = 0 \). The system of equations gives:
- From the first and third rows: \( v_2 = 0 \).
- From the second row: \( v_1 = -v_3 \).

Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( v = (-v_3, 0, v_3) \), and the eigenspace is spanned by \( u = (-1, 0, 1) \). To normalize \( u \), divide by its norm, \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2} \), giving:
\[
u_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Normalization
The given state is \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:
\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of Measuring 0
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the projection of \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \) onto the eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \). Compute the inner product:
\[
\langle u_{\text{normalized}} | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left[ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is the square of this value:
\[
\text{Probability} = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
