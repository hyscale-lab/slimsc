Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again and break it down. 

So, the experiment is about white lupine and resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed, which could affect the plant's resistance.

Now, when they tested the mutants for resistance, they got the following percentages compared to the wild-type (100% resistance):

- g1: 75% → so less resistant than wild-type, but not completely susceptible.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible, so the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3: 50% → half as resistant as wild-type.
- g1g3: 10% → very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. The question is about the interactions between these genes. The options give different conclusions about which is a transcription factor and their relationships.

I remember that in genetics, when the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it's called epistasis. So if a double mutant g1g2 has the same resistance as g2 (both 0%), that suggests that g2 is epistatic to g1. Because g2's mutation is masking the effect of g1's mutation. So the pathway might be that G2 acts upstream of G1. Because if G2 is not working, then whatever G1 does doesn't matter—because the signals can't get past G2.

Wait, but let me think more carefully. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent the downstream genes (like G1 or G3) from being expressed. So, in the mutant g2, the downstream genes' functions are not active. 

Looking at the data: the g2 single mutant is completely susceptible (0% resistance). The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are also 0%—same as g2. So whatever G1 or G3 does, when G2 is knocked out, it makes no difference. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, for the other mutants. The g1 mutant is 75% resistance. So the plant is less resistant than wild-type but not completely susceptible. The g3 mutant is 50% resistance—so even less than g1. 

The double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistance. Which is much lower than either g1 or g3 alone. Hmm. So maybe when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, their combined effect is worse than each alone. 

Wait, but we know that G2 is upstream. So what about G1 and G3? Are they acting in the same pathway, or perhaps in parallel pathways?

The g1 single has 75%, which is worse than wild-type. So it's contributing to resistance. The g3 single is 50%, which is worse than wild-type too. So both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance.

But when you have a double mutant, g1g3, the resistance is 10%—which is worse than either. So perhaps they are in the same pathway and their functions add up. But wait, if they are in the same pathway, and both are necessary, then knocking out both would not have a worse effect than each alone. Alternatively, perhaps they are redundant or part of a synthetic pathway.

Wait, another way: if G2 is a transcription factor, it activates G1 and G3. So without G2 (g2 mutants), neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in g2, resistance is 0% because both are not working. But in g1, G2 is working, so it still activates G3. So in g1, G3 is functional, so resistance is 75%. Wait, but in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that directly activates G1. Then, when G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't expressed. So in g2, G1 isn't active, but maybe G3 is? But in the data, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1's 75% and g3's 50%. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So in a wild-type, G2 is active, so both G1 and G3 are expressed. In g2, both are knocked out, leading to 0% resistance. 

In g1, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed, contributing to resistance. So g1's resistance is 75%—so maybe G3 alone contributes 50% of the resistance. Wait, but the data says g3 is 50%—so when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%. Hmm, but I thought in g1, G3 is active. Let me think again.

Suppose that G2 is upstream. G2 activates G1 and G3. So in wild-type, G1 and G3 are both active, leading to full resistance (100%).

In g1 mutant (G1 not working), G3 is still active because G2 is working. So resistance is only what G3 contributes. If G3's contribution is 50%, then g1 would have 50% resistance. But wait, the data says g1 is 75%—so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream, but maybe G1 and G3 are downstream, but G1 is another transcription factor. Let me think.

In the data: g2 is 0% (so G2 is necessary for any resistance). 

g1 is 75% → so when G1 is knocked out, the plant has 75% resistance.
