Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The experiment is about finding genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've identified three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3. They've made knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3) and tested their resistance to the pathogen.

The data shows the resistance levels compared to the wild-type control. The higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant. So, 100% is the maximum resistance, and 0% means all plants are infected.

Let me look at the data again:

- g1: 75% → So, resistance is reduced but not completely lost.
- g2: 0% → Total loss of resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance of wild-type.
- g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → Same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → Same as g2.

I remember that in genetics, the way mutants interact can tell us about their functional relationships. For instance, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that one gene is epistatic to the other. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, the gene that is epistatic is downstream in the pathway; it's the one whose product is needed for the other gene's product to have an effect.

Wait, no, wait. I think I got that reversed. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, that means gene A is downstream. Because if A is knocked out, the effect of B's presence or absence doesn't matter anymore. So the pathway might be B → A → phenotype. So if you have both B and A knocked out, the phenotype is the same as when A is knocked out. Because A is downstream, its mutation masks the effect of B. So in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1.

Because in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So the presence of the g1 mutation doesn't change the phenotype when g2 is already knocked out. So G2 is epistatic to G1. That means G2 is downstream of G1. So the pathway could be G1 → G2 → something else. Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor, which would act upstream, so it's controlling other genes, like G1.

Wait, the question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor. Because if g2 knockout has 0% resistance, that suggests that without G2, the plant can't resist the disease. So G2's product is necessary for the resistance. That would mean G2 is a critical gene, perhaps a transcription factor that activates other defense genes.

Looking at the data again, g2 alone has 0% resistance. So if the plant can't produce G2, it's completely susceptible. So G2 is essential for resistance. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then it's activating other genes necessary for the resistance. So G1 and G3 could be downstream of G2, or maybe G1 is another gene that G2 activates.

Wait, but when G1 is knocked out (g1), the resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild-type but not zero. So without G1, the plant still has some resistance. That suggests that G1 contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor. So maybe
