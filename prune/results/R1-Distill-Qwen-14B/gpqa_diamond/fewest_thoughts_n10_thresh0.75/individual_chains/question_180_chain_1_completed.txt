Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Alright, let me break it down.

So, the system has 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy contributions from movement or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all located at a distance of 2 meters from P, forming maybe a sphere around it?

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. I remember that for electric potential energy, the formula is something like U = k * q1 * q2 / r, but when you have multiple charges, it's the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, in this case, the charges are all the same, right?

Let me think. The system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, what about the fixed charge at P? Since it's fixed, maybe we don't consider its potential energy with the others in the same way. Hmm, no, because the potential energy is a property of the system as a whole, so all pairs should be considered.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at point P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th. But the 12 charges are each 2m from P, but how about the distance between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, if all 12 are fixed at the same distance from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. Since the problem says they are "constrained to stay at 2 m from P," but their positions can vary on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. But for the potential energy, maybe the configuration that minimizes the energy is when they are equally spaced on the surface of the sphere, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but no, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves depends on their mutual distances. However, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the entire system. So perhaps the arrangement of the 12 charges doesn't affect the potential energy between them? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the potential energy would be the sum of each pair's potential.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, not between the 12 charges themselves. Oh, but that doesn't seem right because the 12 charges themselves would contribute to each other's potential energy as well. Hmm, but the problem says the 12 are constrained, so perhaps they can't move relative to each other, or their mutual distances are fixed? Or maybe the question is only considering the energy due to the 13th charge and the others, not the energy between the 12 others.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. But what about their distance from each other? The problem doesn't specify any constraints on their mutual positions beyond being at 2m from P. So their mutual distances could vary, but maybe that's not part of the problem's consideration.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration that minimizes the energy is when the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual repulsion is minimized. But since they all have the same charge (2e each), they would repel each other. The potential energy between two like charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the system's energy, the 12 charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. But the problem states that they are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, but their positions on the sphere might allow varying distances between each other. But if they are free to move on the sphere, their configuration would arrange to be as far apart as possible to minimize mutual repulsion. Wait, but since all are at 2m from P, their mutual potential energy depends on their configuration.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and not the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because if that's the case, then the calculation is easier.

Let me think: each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the 13th charge. So each contributes a potential energy of (k * q1 * q2) / r. So for each, it's k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). So since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy would be 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2)].

Wait, but wait: the total potential energy for a system of multiple charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So in this case, there are two contributions: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

But the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere can be optimized to minimize the total potential energy. But wait, the potential energy between the 12 charges is all positive because they are like charges. So the total potential energy would be the sum of all the individual contributions. But to find the minimum, perhaps we need to arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, which would minimize the sum of their mutual potential energies. But how?

Alternatively, if the 12 charges are arranged in a regular fashion on the sphere (like vertices of an icosahedron or something), their mutual distances are maximized, which would minimize the sum of 1/r terms, hence minimizing the potential energy.

But wait, calculating that mutual potential energy for 12 charges on a sphere is complicated. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, not between the 12 themselves. But that can't be right because the mutual potential energies are part of the system's total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are fixed in place, so their mutual positions are fixed, and thus their mutual potential energies are already determined. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P and the 13th is fixed at P. It doesn't say anything about the mutual positions of the 12. So perhaps the 12 are free to move on the sphere, but the problem is asking for the minimum possible energy, which would require the 12 to be placed as far from each other as possible, thus minimizing their mutual potential energy. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's impossible since like charges repel and potential energy is positive.

Wait, maybe the problem is only asking about the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12, not the mutual potential energies. That could be a possibility, but I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says it's an isolated system. So the total potential energy would include all pairs. So the 13th charge (fixed at P) interacts with each of the 12, and each of the 12 interacts with the others.

Hmm. So perhaps to compute the total potential energy, I need to calculate two parts: the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the energy between each pair among the 12.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed, and the others are 2m away. So first, the energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2 m. Since there are 12 such pairs, that's 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = 12 * k*(4e²)/(2) = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Then, the energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Each of the 12 charges is at a distance r from each other. But wait, their distances vary. If they are all on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two is determined by their positions. But to find the minimum total potential energy, we have to arrange them such that the sum of all their mutual potentials is minimized.

But this seems complicated because the mutual potential energy for 12 particles on a sphere would require knowing each distance. However, I remember that for N identical charges on a sphere, the configuration that minimizes potential energy is when they are equally spaced, like the vertices of a regular polyhedron. But for 12 particles, that would be an icosahedron arrangement.

But calculating the sum of all mutual potentials for such a configuration would require knowing all the distances between each pair. Alternatively, perhaps each pair is at the same distance from each other, but that's only possible for certain N. For example, 4 charges on a sphere form a tetrahedron, each pair at the same distance. But 12 charges probably can't all be equidistant.

Wait, but maybe each charge is at a distance of 4 meters apart from each other, or something else? Wait, no, if they're on a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum distance between any two would be the diameter, which is 4m. But for 12 charges, the average distance between any two would be less.

Alternatively, perhaps for the minimum energy, each charge is as far as possible from each other, so the mutual potential energy is minimized. But how would I calculate that?

Wait, but the mutual potential energy for each pair is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since q1 and q2 are both 2e, U = (k * (2e)^2) / r = 4 k e² / r.

Now, the problem is, if the 12 charges are placed on a sphere of radius R=2m, what is the sum of 1/r_ij for all i < j, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But I don't know the exact value for this sum. Maybe there's a formula or a known result for this sum when charges are equally spaced on a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick question where the mutual potential energy is considered, but the problem is only looking for the potential due to the central charge.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are on the order of 1e-26 J or one option is 122 J. Wait, 122 J is way larger than the others. The elementary charge is about 1.6e-19 C. Let me think about the numbers.

Each charge is 2e, so 3.2e-19 C. Let me compute the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

The 13th charge is 2e, each of the 12 is 2e. Distance is 2 m.

So each pair contributes U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2 = (k * 4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

There are 12 such pairs, so 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

What is the value of 24 k e²?

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

Calculating:

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2

Let me compute that step by step.

First, (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = approximately 2.3e-28.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38 = approx 23.03 * 1e-29 = 2.303e-28.

Then multiply by 24: 2.303e-28 *24 = approx 5.527e-27 J.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute 8.988e9 multiplied by (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 * 1e9-38 = (approx 23.03) * 1e-29 = 2.303e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.303e-28 = 5.5272e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than this. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is also larger. So my initial calculation suggests that only considering the U between 13th and 12 charges gives me about 5.5e-27 J. But none of the options match exactly. Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Hmm, because if each of the 12 charges are placed on the sphere, each contributes to the potential energy of every other. Each pair contributes 4 k e² / r_ij. So the sum over all pairs would be the sum of (4 k e² / r_ij) for every pair i < j among the 12.

But what is the sum of 1/r_ij for all pairs when 12 identical charges are on a sphere of radius R?

I'm not sure, but perhaps there's a formula for this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the contributions from the central charge. But that doesn't seem right because 12 charges each at 2m would have mutual distances varying, but the 1/r terms might add up.

Wait, but let's think about the order of magnitude. Let's say the average distance between any two charges is, say, around 2m as well. Wait, but that's not correct because the 12 charges are on a sphere of 2m radius. The distance between two points on the sphere would be at least 0 (if at the same point) up to 4m (diametrically opposite). But the average would be something else.

Wait, perhaps for the case of N charges on a sphere, the average distance between two charges is given by something. I vaguely remember that for a sphere of radius R, the average distance between two randomly chosen points is (3R)/2. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of all 1/r_ij can be approximated for a sphere of radius R. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because all charges are positive.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered, but it's possible that the problem is only asking about the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the mutual potential among the 12. Because if that's the case, then our initial calculation would be 5.5e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly matching. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Let me re-calculate.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

Each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C.

Each pair between the 13th and a 12th charge contributes U = (k * (2e)^2) / 2 m.

So U_pair = k * ( (2e) * (2e) ) / 2 = k * (4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

12 pairs, so U_total = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Compute 24 k e²:

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Then, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

Multiply 8.988 * 2.566: 8 * 2.566 is 20.528, 0.988 * 2.566 is approx 2.536. Total is approx 23.064.

So 23.064 * 1e9 * 1e-38 = 23.064e-29 = 2.3064e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3064e-28 = 55.3536e-28 = 5.53536e-27 J.

Hmm, about 5.54e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, why the discrepancy? Am I missing something?

Ah, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is also considered and is positive, so the total would be higher than 5.5e-27. But the minimum energy would be when this mutual energy is as small as possible. Wait, but wait, the mutual potential energy would be the sum of all pairwise terms of (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij for all pairs among the 12.

If the charges are arranged to minimize this sum, meaning to place them as far apart as possible, which would mean each pair is as far as possible, but given that they're constrained on a sphere, perhaps the sum can't be zero. Hmm, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute the sum.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, not the mutual energy between the 12. Because in that case, the energy would be 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me re-check the math.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2: 1.602^2 is approximately 2.566, so 2.566e-38 C².

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 = let me compute that.

8.988 * 2 = 17.976,

8.988 * 0.5 =4.494,

8.988 * 0.066= approx 0.594.

Adding up: 17.976 + 4.494 =22.47, +0.594=23.064.

So 23.064e-29 =2.3064e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3064e-28 = 55.3536e-28 =5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Looking back at the options:

A) 5.645e-26 → 5.6e-26

B)2.822e-26 → 2.8e-26

C)7.056e-27 →7.0e-27

D)122.330 → around 122 J.

So my calculated value is 5.535e-27, which is about half of option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, each charge is 2e, so when calculating the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, it's U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r = 4 k e² / r.

Wait, but wait, r is 2 m. So 4 k e² / 2 = 2 k e². That's correct.

Multiply by 12 → 24 k e².

Yes, correct.

So where is the mistake? Oh wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all pairs, including the 12 charges themselves. So the total U would be the sum of U_13th with each 12, plus the sum of each pair among the 12.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute that part. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual energy, leading to U =5.5e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Wait, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is roughly 1.27 times my calculated value. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 again.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2:

1.602^2 = (1.6^2) + (0.002^2) + 2*(1.6)(0.002) = 2.56 + 0.000004 + 0.0064 = approx 2.5664.

So 2.5664e-38.

Now, 8.988e9 * 2.5664e-38 = 8.988 * 2.5664 * 1e9 * 1e-38.

8.988 * 2.5664 = let me compute this more accurately.

8 * 2.5664 =20.5312,

0.988 *2.5664 = let's compute: 1 * 2.5664 =2.5664, minus 0.012 * 2.5664 = 0.030797. So 2.5664 - 0.030797=2.5356.

Total: 20.5312 + 2.5356=23.0668.

So 23.0668e-29 =2.30668e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.30668e-28 = 55.359e-28 =5.5359e-27 J.

So same result.

Hmm, the only option close is option C, but it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 because each interaction is counted twice, but in our initial calculation, we considered each pair once. Wait, no, because when you have 12 charges, the number of pairs is (12 *11)/2 =66. So if the mutual potential energy is (4 k e²) / r_ij for each pair, the sum would be 66 terms, each with varying r_ij.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute this sum. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the mutual energy. In that case, the answer would be 5.5e-27 J, but it's not an option.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 k e².

Wait, 24 *8.988e9 = let me compute that.

24 *8.988e9 = (20 *8.988e9) + (4 *8.988e9) = 179.76e9 +35.952e9 =215.712e9= 2.15712e11.

Then multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

So 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 *2.566) * 1e11-38 =5.536e-27.

Same result as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the 13th charge and the others, but the correct answer is not among the options. But wait, the options do have option B as 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than 5.5e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me recheck: the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 pairs. Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / 2, because r=2m.

Wait, 2e times 2e is 4e². So each pair's potential energy is (k *4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Total for 12 pairs:12 *2 k e² =24 k e².

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the 13th charge is also 2e, but the others are 2e as well. So each pair is 2e *2e. That part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let's see:

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So,

24 k e² =24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 24 *8.988e9 = 2.157e11.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

2.157e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.157 *2.566) *1e(11-38) = 5.536e-27.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the system in a different way. For example, using the formula for a system of point charges: U = (1/2) * sum_{i<j} (k q_i q_j)/r_ij.

But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and the others are each 2m away from it. So the total U would be the sum of all pairs.

So U = sum_{i=1 to 12} (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2) ) + sum_{i<j in 12} (k*(2e)*(2e))/r_ij.

But without knowing the r_ij for the 12 charges, I can't compute the second sum. So perhaps the problem is only asking for the first part, which is the energy between the 13th charge and the others.

In that case, the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but this isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another possibility: the 13th charge is fixed, so maybe each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k * q * Q) / r, where Q is the fixed charge at P (which is 2e), and q is the charge of the 12 (2e). So each contributes (k * (2e)^2)/(2) ). That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering both the 13th charge and the 12 charges as part of the sum, but the 13th is fixed and doesn't move. So the potential energy is due to the 12 charges being placed in the field of the 13th.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking at the options, perhaps option B is half of option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 * k * e².

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

k *4e²=8.988e9 *4 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Wait, no, wait. Let's recompute 24 *k *e².

Wait, each pair between the 13th and the 12 is U =k*(2e)^2 /2 = (4 k e²)/2=2 k e².

12 pairs →12 *2 k e²=24 k e².

So 24 *k *e²=24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) * 1e9 *1e-38 =approx 23.06 * 1e-29=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.306e-28=5.5344e-27 J.

Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

A) 5.645e-26 → larger by a factor of ~100.

B)2.822e-26 → larger by a factor of ~50.

C)7.056e-27 → about 1.27 times my result.

D)122 J → way too big.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is considering the energy between the 12 charges and the 13th, but I'm missing a factor. Maybe it's the potential energy contribution from the 13th charge being in the field of the 12 charges, but that's the same as the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the potential energy as if each of the 12 charges is placed at 2m from the 13th, but the 13th is not moving, so perhaps we don't count its potential energy. But that doesn't make sense because the potential energy is mutual.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as fixed, so only the potential energy of the 12 charges in the field of the 13th is considered. But that would be the same as the 13th and each 12th's contribution.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of the potentials experienced by each of the 12 charges due to the 13th charge and each other.

Wait, but that would complicate things. The potential energy of a charge in an electric field is the sum of the potentials from all other charges.

So each charge at 2m from P (the 13th) experiences a potential from the 13th charge of V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

Additionally, each charge experiences the potential from the other 11 charges. But the position of each relative to the others affects this.

But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute. But maybe the problem is only considering the potential from the 13th charge.

Wait, but potential energy is a system property, so perhaps it's the sum of the products of each charge and the potential at its location due to all other charges.

So for each charge, U_i = q_i * V_i, where V_i is the sum of potentials at i's position due to all other charges.

For the 13th charge (fixed at P), V_13 is due to each of the 12 charges: sum_{j=1 to 12} k*(2e)/(2) = 12 * [k * (2e)/2 ] =12 *k e.

So the potential at P due to the 12 charges is 12 *k e.

So the potential energy of the 13th charge is U_13 = (2e) * V_13 =2e *12 k e =24 k e².

Similarly, each of the 12 charges at 2m from P experiences a potential from the 13th charge: V_i =k*(2e)/2= k e.

And each experiences a potential from the other 11 charges. The potential from each of the other 11 is k*(2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

So the potential at i's location is V_i =k e (from the 13th) + sum_{j≠i} [k*(2e)/r_ij ].

Thus, the potential energy of charge i is U_i = (2e) * V_i = 2e [k e + sum_{j≠i} (k 2e)/r_ij ].

But again, without knowing r_ij, it's hard to compute. But perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the others, but not the mutual terms. So each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of 2e * k e = 2 k e². So for 12 charges, that's 12 *2 k e²=24 k e², same as before.

So in that case, the total potential energy would be 24 k e², which is 5.5e-27 J. But this isn't one of the options. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me check Coulomb's constant. Sometimes it's approximated as 9e9 N·m²/C².

Let me re-calculate with k=9e9.

24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

9e9 *2.566e-38=23.094e-29=2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.3094e-28=55.4256e-28=5.54256e-27 J.

Still same order.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that the energy is in joules and perhaps the charge is 2e, so I should have (2e)^2=4e², but I think I accounted for that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, including the 13th charge and each 12, and all pairs among the 12. But without knowing the mutual distances, maybe the mutual potential is considered zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy, which would make the answer 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 * k * e².

Let me compute it again with precise numbers.

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 1.602e-19 *1.602e-19 = (1.602)^2 *1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

Now, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) *1e-29.

8.988 *2.566.

Let me compute:

8 *2.566=20.528.

0.988 *2.566.

Compute 0.9 *2.566=2.3094.

0.08 *2.566=0.20528.

0.008 *2.566=0.020528.

Add them: 2.3094 +0.20528=2.51468 +0.020528=2.535208.

So total 8.988 *2.566 =20.528 +2.535208=23.063208.

So 23.063208e-29 =2.3063208e-28.

Multiply by24:24 *2.3063208e-28 =55.3517e-28=5.53517e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 5.54e-27 J, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Another possibility: maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a ring or some other configuration where their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible with like charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the system's potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. So for the 13th charge, it's fixed, so no work is done on it. For each of the 12 charges, the work done is the potential at their position due to all charges already placed.

So, for the first charge, work is (k*(2e))/(2) =k e.

For the second charge, the potential at 2m from P is due to the first charge (k*(2e))/(r), where r is the distance between the two charges. If they are arranged on a sphere, perhaps the distance between any two is 2m as well, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, no, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. If they are arranged as a regular icosahedron, the mutual distances would vary, but perhaps the average is considered.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual terms. So the total energy is 24 k e²=5.5e-27 J.

Since none of the options match, perhaps it's a trick question where the minimum energy is zero, but that doesn't make sense because the charges are all positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the energy to be the sum of the 12 charges' potential energies in the field of the 13th charge, each contributing (k*(2e)^2)/2.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

Thus, I'm concluding that the correct answer is approximately 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have this. Looking at the options again, perhaps option C is the intended answer, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think: 12 charges each interacting with the 13th gives 12 pairs. The mutual interactions among the 12 are C(12,2)=66 pairs. If each mutual pair contributes a similar amount, say (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =2 k e² per pair, then the mutual energy would be 66 *2 k e²=132 k e².

Adding that to the previous 24 k e² gives 156 k e². Which would be 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 156 *8.988e9=1.400e12.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

1.4e12 *2.566e-38= 3.592e-26.

Which is close to option A, 5.645e-26, but not quite.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each mutual pair is at a distance of 2m, which is unlikely because that would imply all charges are at the same point, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps each mutual pair is at a distance of 4m (diametrically opposite on the sphere), but that's only possible for two charges. So perhaps the mutual distance is 2m on average, but that's guesswork.

Wait, if each mutual pair is at 2m, then each mutual U =4 k e²/(2)=2 k e². 66 pairs →132 k e².

Total U =132 *2 k e²=264 k e².

Wait, no, each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r. If r=2m, then each mutual U is 2 k e². So 66 *2 k e²=132 k e².

Plus the 13th's contribution of 24 k e²: total U=156 k e².

156 *8.988e9=1.400e12.

1.4e12 *2.566e-38=3.592e-26 J.

Which is close to option A (5.6e-26) but not exact. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, which is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try with k=9e9:

24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2=24*9e9*2.566e-38.

24*9=216.

216e9 *2.566e-38=216 *2.566e-29=554.496e-29=5.54496e-27 J.

Still, same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different charge value, like each charge is e, but no, the problem states 2e.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C. But I can't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but each pair is counted twice. Wait, no, because each pair is counted once in the sum.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge as the sum of the electric potentials at each of the 12 charges. So each 12th charge is placed at 2m from P, and the potential at each is V =k*(2e)/(2) =k e. So each 12th charge contributes a potential energy of (2e) * (k e) =2 k e². For 12 charges, that's 24 k e², same as before.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the answer should be around 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, but I'm not sure how that value was obtained.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done with e =1.6e-19 instead of 1.602e-19.

Let me try with e=1.6e-19.

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38=23.04e-29=2.304e-28.

Multiply by24:55.296e-28=5.5296e-27 J.

Still not matching option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for k, like 8.99e9.

Let me compute with k=8.99e9.

24 *8.99e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

24 *8.99e9=215.76e9.

215.76e9 *2.566e-38=215.76 *2.566e-29=553.43e-29=5.5343e-27 J.

Still same.

Hmm.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for the 13th charge and each 12th, it's (k*(2e)*(2e))/2 = (4 k e²)/2=2 k e² per pair. 12 pairs→24 k e².

But wait, perhaps the formula requires the product of the charges, which is (2e)*(2e)=4e². So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the 13th charge is fixed, so its potential energy isn't counted. But no, the potential energy is a system property.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the system as the sum of the potential energies of each charge in the field of all others, but without double-counting.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, given the options and my calculations, I think the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's option B:2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger. But I can't find a reason for that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check:

(1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

Yes.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Multiply by24 →5.535e-27.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the energy in a different way, like the work done to assemble the system.

The work to bring the 13th charge to P is zero because it's fixed.

Then, bringing each of the 12 charges to their positions, each at 2m from P.

The potential at each position due to the already placed charges.

Wait, for the first charge: potential at 2m due to the 13th charge is V1 =k*(2e)/2= k e.

So work done is (2e) * V1 = 2e *k e =2 k e².

For the second charge: potential at 2m due to the 13th is V1=k e, and due to the first charge, V2=k*(2e)/r, where r is the distance between charge 1 and 2.

If the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is equidistant from the others, which isn't possible, but let's assume they're all at the same distance, say, 2m apart. Then, V2=k*(2e)/2= k e.

So the potential at the second charge's position is V =k e + k e =2k e.

Work done is (2e) *2k e=4 k e².

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, leading to 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \).

### Key Contributions to Potential Energy
1. **Potential Energy Between the 13th Charge and Each of the 12 Charges**:
   Each pair of charges contributes to the potential energy:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = k \cdot \frac{(2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 2 k e^2
   \]
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{total, 13th and 12}} = 12 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 24 k e^2
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges Themselves**:
   The problem does not explicitly provide details about the mutual distances between the 12 charges. However, since the charges are constrained to stay at \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \), their mutual distances depend on their arrangement on the surface of a sphere. Calculating the exact sum of mutual potential energies requires knowledge of their specific configuration, which is not provided. For simplicity, the problem may assume that the mutual potential energy is negligible or not explicitly considered.

### Calculation of \( U_{\text{total, 13th and 12}} \)
Using Coulomb's constant \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):
\[
U_{\text{total, 13th and 12}} = 24 \cdot k \cdot e^2
\]
First, calculate \( e^2 \):
\[
e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]
Then:
\[
U_{\text{total, 13th and 12}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
\]
\[
U_{\text{total, 13th and 12}} = 24 \cdot 2.306 \times 10^{-28} = 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated value of \( 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not exactly match any of the given options. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**. This discrepancy might arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as neglecting the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges or using slightly different values for constants.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
