Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of charges and calculating the minimum energy. Alright, let's read it carefully.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That's 3.2e-19 C each.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is like this: one charge is at point P, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. Wait, are all the twelve at the same point 2m from P, or are they arranged in some symmetric way? Well, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m, but doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, but for minimum energy, I think the charges would arrange in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Oh wait, but in this case, since the problem says they are constrained, maybe their positions are fixed, so we don't have to worry about their positions—they’re at fixed points 2m away.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 others are each at a distance of 2m from P, but are they all at the same point? No, that can't be because then they'd be close to each other, which would lead to higher potential energy. But maybe they're placed symmetrically around P, like on a sphere, each 2m away.

But the problem is about calculating the minimum energy of the system. Wait, what's the system's energy? Potential energy, I think. Because the system's energy in terms of electric potential energy.

Wait, the system is isolated, so we're considering the electrostatic potential energy between all pairs of charges.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are each 2m away from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Hmm, that's a key point. Because if the 12 charges are at 2m from P, their mutual distances could affect the potential energy. But without knowing their exact positions, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 are each at a distance of 2m from P but all are very far from each other, so their mutual interactions are negligible. Or maybe the problem is simplified, and we only consider the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, not between the 12 themselves.

Wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum would be when the mutual repulsions are minimized. But since all the 12 charges are identical and positive, they would repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, which is the work done to bring them together, perhaps they would all be as far apart as possible. But the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so maybe their mutual distances are not considered, and we only calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge at P.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But the system includes all 13 charges, right?

So the 13th charge is fixed at P, and each of the other 12 are 2m away from P. So the potential energy would be the sum of the energy between the 13th and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair among the 12.

But wait, if the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not given, perhaps the problem assumes that they are all at the same point, but that can't be possible because they would repel each other. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual potential energies.

Wait, no. The total potential energy is the sum over all pairs. So the total U would be:

U = sum over all pairs (k * q_i q_j / r_ij)

But the question is, what is r_ij between the 12 charges? If they are all at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other are not specified, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the others, not among themselves. That would make sense if the problem is given in a way that their mutual distances are considered to be much larger, making the potential energy between them negligible. But if all 12 are at the same point 2m away, then each of them is very close to each other, so their mutual potential energy would be significant.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and the mutual interactions are ignored. Because otherwise, the problem would need more information about the arrangement of the 12 charges.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So if the 12 charges are all at 2m from P but can move around as long as they are at that distance, to minimize the total potential energy, perhaps the mutual potential energies are minimized. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are each at 2m from P and their mutual distances are all the same. So they form a regular icosahedron or something around P. But perhaps the mutual distances are all much larger than 2m, so their mutual potential energies are much smaller compared to the potential energies between each and the central charge. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that the 12 are at 2m from P, but nothing about their mutual distances. So perhaps the problem is designed so that we only consider the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual energies between the 12.

But that seems a bit odd because the mutual energies would contribute to the total potential energy. But maybe the problem is structured so that the mutual distances are either not contributing or are assumed to be infinitely large, making their contributions zero. Or perhaps the problem only considers the central charge and each of the 12, neglecting the interactions among the 12.

Wait, but the problem says the system is isolated, so all interactions are considered. Hmm. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energies sum up to zero, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, not the others' mutual interactions.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "what is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?" So the system's total potential energy would include all the pairs.

So, the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at 2m from P. So the distances between each of the 12 charges and the 13th are 2m. What about between the 12 charges themselves?

Assuming the 12 are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are much larger, then the potential energy between them would be negligible. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 are at the same point, which would make their mutual distances zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that they are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2m, so their mutual distances are all the same. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to calculate their mutual potential energy.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is designed such that we only consider the potential energy between the 13th and the others, and not among the others themselves. So let's proceed with that assumption.

So, the potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges. Each of these is k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m), right?

Wait, no. Wait, the 13th charge is 2e, and each of the other 12 is 2e. So each pair contributes k*(2e)*(2e)/(distance between them). The distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2m.

So the energy for each pair is (9e9) * (2e)^2 / 2 meters. But wait, wait a second. Wait, e is the elementary charge, so each charge is 2e.

So each pair is 2e * 2e = 4e². Distance is 2m. So each pair contributes (k * 4e² ) / (2).

Since there are 12 such pairs (the 13th charge with each of the 12), total U from these pairs would be 12 * (k * 4e² / 2) = 12 * (k * 2 e²) = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait, let's compute that.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute each term as (k * q1 * q2 ) / r. So q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2m. So each term is (k * (2e)(2e)) / 2 = (k *4 e² ) / 2 = 2 k e².

There are 12 such terms, so 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, I'm neglecting the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves. So if each of the 12 charges is 2e, then each pair among the 12 contributes (k * (2e)(2e))/r_ij. But what is r_ij?

If the 12 are arranged in a way that each is 2m from P, but their mutual distances are all the same, say, 2m as well, which is unlikely. But if they are on a sphere of radius 2m, their mutual distance would be larger. Let's say, for 12 points on a sphere, what's the average distance? Hmm, but perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual distances are all 2m as well. But that's not possible because if all 12 are at 2m from P, they cannot all be 2m from each other unless it's a very specific arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are to be considered as 2m as well. But that would mean each of the 12 charges is 2m away from every other charge, which is impossible because you can't have 12 points all equidistant from each other in 3D space. It's possible on a sphere, but the distance would be based on the geometry.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual potential energies among the 12. Maybe the answer is calculated just based on that, and the mutual energies are considered negligible or zero. But that seems unlikely because the mutual energies should contribute to the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies sum to zero. But I don't think that's the case, as same charges would repel, leading to positive potential energy.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the mutual potential energies are minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing their arrangement, it's hard to compute.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12, considering that their mutual distances are much larger, making their contributions negligible compared to the potential energies with the 13th charge. Let's proceed with that assumption for now.

So, the total U is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th charge.

Each term is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m.

So, k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Calculating each term:

(8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2 * 1) meters.

Wait, 2e is 2 times the elementary charge, which is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = let me compute that. 3.204e-19 squared is approximately (3.204)^2 = ~10.26, times 1e-38, so 1.026e-37 C².

Wait, wait, actually, 3.204^2 is 3.204 * 3.204. Let's compute that: 3*3 is 9, 3*0.204 is 0.612, 0.204*3 is another 0.612, and 0.204^2 is about 0.0416. So adding up, 9 + 0.612 + 0.612 + 0.0416 = 10.2656. So (3.204e-19)^2 is approximately 10.2656e-38 C², which is 1.02656e-37 C².

So each term is (8.988e9) * (1.02656e-37) / 2.

Because each is 2m apart.

So 8.988e9 * 1.02656e-37 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9.

1.02656e-37 is approximately 1.02656 x 10^-37.

Multiplying these together: 8.988 * 1.02656 ≈ let's compute that. 8 *1 is 8, 8*0.02656 is ~0.2125, 0.988 *1 is ~0.988, 0.988 *0.02656 is ~0.02634. Hmm, maybe a better approach: 8.988 * 1.02656 = 8.988 *1 + 8.988 *0.02656.

8.988 *1 =8.988.

8.988 *0.02656 ≈ approximately 0.239.

So total is about 9.227.

So 9.227e(9-37) = 9.227e-28.

Divide by 2: 9.227e-28 /2 ≈4.6135e-28 J per pair.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recalculate the multiplication.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.02656e-37 = (8.988 * 1.02656) * 10^(9-37) )= 9.227 * 1e-28 (since 9-37= -28).

So that's 9.227e-28. Then, divide by 2, getting 4.6135e-28 J per pair.

But wait, each of the 12 pairs contributes this, so total U is 12 * 4.6135e-28 ≈ 55.362e-28 J, which is 5.5362e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, the options are in the 1e-26 or 1e-27 range.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

So 5.536e-27 J is approximately 5.536 x 10^-27, which is close to option C (7.056e-27). Hmm, but not exactly. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate more carefully.

Each pair's potential energy is k*(2e)^2/(2m).

So:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

(2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 = (3.204e-19 C)^2 = (3.204)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 10.2656 * 1e-38 = 1.02656e-37 C².

So each term is (8.988e9) * (1.02656e-37) / (2).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *1.02656e-37 = (8.988 *1.02656) * 1e(9-37) ) = (9.227 approx) * 1e-28.

So 9.227e-28 / 2 = 4.6135e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.6135e-28 *12 = 55.362e-28 = 5.5362e-27 J.

So total U is about 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 7.056e-27, but that's higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I forgot a factor. Let me check the formula.

Wait, potential energy for a pair is U = k q1 q2 / r.

In this case, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e. So U = k (2e)(2e) / r = 4 k e² / r.

Wait, so perhaps I should compute 4 * k * e² / r.

Wait, let me try that.

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So e² = 2.566e-38.

So 4 k e² =4 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

So 4 *8.988e9 = 3.5952e10.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 3.5952e10 * 2.566e-38 = (3.5952 *2.566) * 1e(10-38) ) = approx 9.227 * 1e-28.

Then, divide by r =2 m: 9.227e-28 /2 =4.6135e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.6135e-28 *12 =5.536e-27 J total.

Hmm, same result as before.

But the options don't have 5.5e-27. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2m away. So each of the 12 contributes a potential energy term with the 13th charge. But in addition, the 12 charges themselves are interacting. So, the mutual potential energy between any two of the 12 charges is k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two of them.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore this part, but in that case, the total energy would be the 5.5e-27 J, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are zero. But that doesn't make sense because like charges repel, leading to positive potential energy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the 12 charges as a single entity, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: the system's potential energy is the sum of all pairs, including the 12 mutual pairs. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energies sum up to zero or are negligible. But that doesn't seem correct.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that they form a regular dodecahedron or some other symmetric shape, but without knowing the exact distance between them, it's hard to compute their mutual potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies are all equal and can be summed up. But without the exact distance, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but not the mutual energies. Let's proceed with that.

So the total U is 5.536e-27 J. But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the computations.

Each term: (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2.

k =8.988e9, (2e) =3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 =10.265e-38 C² =1.0265e-37 C².

So each term: 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 /2.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 =?

8.988 *1.0265 = let's compute it accurately.

1.0265 *8=8.212.

1.0265 *0.988 = let's compute that:

1.0265 *0.9 = 0.92385

1.0265 *0.088 = approx 0.0907.

Total for 0.988: 0.92385 +0.0907=1.01455.

So 8.212 +1.01455=9.22655.

So 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 =9.22655e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613275e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.613275e-28 *12=55.3593e-28 =5.53593e-27 J.

So approximately 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is7.056e-27 J. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges each at 2m from P, but the 13th charge is at 0m from each of them. So each of the 12 is 2m from P, and the 13th is at P (so 0m from P). So the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 charges is 2m, not 0. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot the number of pairs. Let me think about the total number of pairs.

The system has 13 charges. The total number of pairs is (13 *12)/2 =78 pairs. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2m away. So the pairs are:

- 12 pairs between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

- Then, the 12 charges have C(12,2)=66 pairs among themselves.

But without knowing their mutual distances, how can we compute the mutual potential energy?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all the mutual distances are zero, which would make the potential energy for those pairs infinite. But that's impossible, so that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the mutual energies. So the total U is 5.536e-27 J, but that's not among the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times 5.64e-27. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, no. Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge, so 12 pairs. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the 13th charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each pair contributes k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) = 2 k e² / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters.

So 2 * k * e² / 2 = k e².

So each pair contributes k e², and with 12 pairs, U =12 k e².

Ah! Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute that.

So, U =12 * k e².

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

e =1.602e-19 C.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38 C².

So k e² =8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988 *2.566 ≈ 23. (Because 8 *2.5=20, 0.988 *2.5≈2.47, 8 *0.066≈0.528, 0.988*0.066≈0.065. So adding up: 20 +2.47 +0.528 +0.065≈23.06.)

So 23.06e(9-38) =23.06e-29 =2.306e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 *2.306e-28 =27.672e-28 =2.7672e-27 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.767e-27 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger by a factor of 10. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than this value.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the exponents.

Wait, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

2.566e-38 =2.566 *1e-38.

Multiply them: 8.988 *2.566 = let's compute accurately.

8 *2=16.

8 *0.566=4.528.

0.988 *2=1.976.

0.988 *0.566≈0.560.

Adding up: 16 +4.528=20.528; 1.976 +0.560=2.536. Total ≈20.528 +2.536=23.064.

So 23.064 *1e9 *1e-38=23.064e-29.

Which is 2.3064e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.3064e-28 *12=27.6768e-28 J =2.76768e-27 J.

So approximately 2.768e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (7.056e-27), but that's about twice as big.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering not only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, but also the potential energy between the 12 themselves. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that all 12 are at the same point, making r_ij=0, which would lead to infinite potential energy, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances between the 12 are considered to be very large, making their potential energies negligible, and only the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is considered. But in that case, the total would be 2.768e-27 J, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the system's potential energy is minimized when the mutual distances between the 12 charges are as large as possible. But without knowing their exact positions, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the mutual potential energies, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies sum up to zero, but that's only possible if they are arranged symmetrically in a way that their repulsions cancel out, but that's unlikely with all same charges.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m around P, and their mutual distances are such that the potential energy can be computed using a formula.

But I don't remember the exact formula for the potential energy of a spherical arrangement of charges.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance R from each other, but I don't know R.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the potential energy between the 12 charges is zero. But that's not possible because same charges would repel, leading to positive potential energy.

Wait, but if the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the mutual energies, then the total U is about 2.768e-27 J. Looking at the options, none match exactly, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the exact value again.

Compute k e²:

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38 C².

So k e² =8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988 *2.566:

8 *2=16

8 *0.566=4.528

0.988 *2=1.976

0.988 *0.566≈0.560

Adding: 16 +4.528=20.528; 1.976 +0.560=2.536. Total 20.528+2.536=23.064.

So 23.064e(9-38)=23.064e-29=2.3064e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.3064e-28 *12 =27.6768e-28=2.76768e-27 J.

So approximately 2.768e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies are zero, which I don't think is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges as well, but assuming their mutual distances are 2m, which would make each mutual pair's potential energy k*(2e)^2/(2m).

So, for each mutual pair, U = k*(2e)^2/(2m) = same as the pairs between the 13th and each 12.

So each mutual pair contributes 4.6135e-28 J, as before.

The number of mutual pairs among the 12 is C(12,2)=66.

So their total mutual potential energy would be 66 *4.6135e-28 =66 *4.6135e-28 ≈ 304.431e-28 =3.04431e-26 J.

Then, the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 is 12 *4.6135e-28 =5.5362e-27 J.

So total U =3.0443e-26 +5.5362e-27 = approximately 3.5979e-26 J.

But looking at the options, option A is5.645e-26, which is about 1.5 times higher.

Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps the assumption that mutual distances are 2m is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are much larger, making their potential energies negligible, but in that case, the U would be 5.5e-27, which isn't among the options.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in thinking that the mutual distances are 2m. The problem states that each of the 12 is 2m from P, but their mutual distances could be anything else. So perhaps the problem is intended to only calculate the potential energy between the 13th and the others.

In that case, the total U is 5.536e-27 J, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the number of pairs. There are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed, the other 12 are each 2m away. So the number of pairs involving the 13th is 12. The number of mutual pairs among the 12 is 12*11/2=66.

So total pairs is 78.

But again, without mutual distances, perhaps the problem is ignoring the mutual pairs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, which is 12 pairs, and not the mutual ones. So U=12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So, 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 ] / (2 *2).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 2m. So each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

Wait, earlier I computed (k*(2e)^2)/(2) as 4.6135e-28 J per pair. Multiply by 12:5.536e-27 J.

But perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (2e)^2 again.

2e = 2 *1.602e-19 C=3.204e-19 C.

(3.204e-19)^2= (3.204)^2 * (1e-19)^2 =10.265 *1e-38=1.0265e-37 C².

So, for each pair:

U = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / (2) = ?

8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 =8.988 *1.0265e-28 =approx 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:4.613e-28 *12=5.536e-27 J.

So why isn't this matching any option?

Looking at the options again:

Option C is7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, 5.536e-27 is about 0.78 times option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent. Let me compute 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 *1e9.

1.0265e-37 is 1.0265 *1e-37.

So 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 = (8.988 *1.0265) * (1e9 *1e-37) ) = (9.226) * 1e-28.

So 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.536e-27 J.

Hmm, no matching option. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies, but then the answer is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the potential energy is calculated as (k q1 q2 )/(r), and I forgot to account for something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each 2m away from it. So each of the 12 contributes a potential energy term with the 13th charge, and also with each other.

But without knowing their mutual distances, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distances are much larger, making their potential energies negligible. So the total U is just the sum of the 12 pairs.

But in that case, the answer should be 5.536e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exact value.

Let me compute each term precisely.

Compute (2e)^2:

(2 *1.602176634e-19 C)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2.

Which is (3.204353268)^2 = approx 10.266.

So (3.20435e-19)^2 =10.266e-38 C²=1.0266e-37 C².

So each term is (8.988e9) * (1.0266e-37) / (2).

Compute 8.988e9 *1.0266e-37 =8.988 *1.0266 *1e-28.

8.988 *1.0266 ≈ let's calculate accurately.

8 *1.0266 =8.2128.

0.988 *1.0266 ≈ let's calculate:

0.988 *1 =0.988.

0.988 *0.0266 ≈0.02628.

Total ≈0.988 +0.02628=1.01428.

So 8.2128 +1.01428 =9.22708.

So 9.22708e-28.

Divide by 2:4.61354e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:4.61354e-28 *12=5.53625e-27 J.

So approximately 5.536e-27 J.

But the options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330.

Hmm, none match exactly. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 13th charge is at 0m from itself, but that's not relevant. Or perhaps I confused coulombs and something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the mutual ones, but using a formula that sums them up assuming a particular arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron around the 13th, each 2m away. In that case, the mutual distance between two charges would be the edge length of a regular dodecahedron with radius 2m.

But calculating the edge length of a regular dodecahedron is non-trivial. The formula for the edge length a in terms of the radius R is a = R * sqrt(3) * (sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) ) / ( sqrt(5) +1 ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the edge length is roughly 2m * (sqrt(5) -1), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual distance is 4m, but without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2m as well, leading each mutual pair to contribute U =k*(2e)^2/(2m)= same as before.

So for the mutual pairs, number of pairs is 66, each contributing 4.6135e-28 J.

So mutual U =66 *4.6135e-28=3.044e-26 J.

Adding the 5.536e-27 J from the 13th charge, total U =3.044e-26 +5.536e-27 =3.597e-26 J.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are much larger than 2m, making their potential energies negligible.

In that case, the total U is 5.536e-27 J, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the potential energy should be calculated as (k q1 q2)/r, but considering that each pair is counted once, not twice.

Wait, no, in the sum over all pairs, each pair is considered once. So the calculation seems correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, what is the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges?

The total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs (k q_i q_j )/r_ij.

In this problem, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the 12 others are each at 2m from P.

So the pairs are:

- 12 pairs between the 13th and each of the 12.

- C(12,2)=66 pairs between the 12.

Assuming the mutual distances are much larger than 2m, their contributions are negligible. So U ≈ sum of the 12 pairs.

Which is 5.536e-27 J.

But the options are not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 in the formula. Because in the sum over pairs, each pair is counted once. So when I calculated for each of the 12, I multiplied by 12, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as (k q^2)/r for each charge, but since each charge is counted twice, I should multiply by 12/2=6. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (k q^2 )/(r) * (n-1), where n is the number of charges at distance r.

In this case, n=12, r=2m.

So U =12 * (k (2e)^2 )/(2m) * (12-1)/2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (k q^2 )/(r) multiplied by the number of pairs.

Which is what I did.

I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer among the options, perhaps option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than the 5.5e-27 I calculated. So perhaps I missed a factor of 5.

Wait, 5.5e-27 *5 =2.75e-26, which is close to option B (2.822e-26).

How could I have missed a factor of 5?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that each charge is 2e, so q=2e, not e.

Wait, no, earlier I used 2e for each charge.

Hmm, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the formula for gravitational potential energy, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so the number of pairs involving it is 12. The mutual pairs among the 12 are 66. So total pairs is 78.

But without knowing mutual distances, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate only the 12 pairs.

Wait, but I'm stuck. The only option that's close to my calculation is option C (7.056e-27), but that's about 2.5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 8.988e9 * (2e)^2 / 2m again.

Wait, (2e)^2= (3.204e-19)^2=1.0265e-37 C².

So (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) =8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 = let's compute the exponent: 1e9 *1e-37=1e-28.

So 8.988 *1.0265 = approx 9.226.

So 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2m: 9.226e-28/2=4.613e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 5.536e-27 J.

But perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

If k=9e9, then:

Each pair: (9e9) * (1.0265e-37) /2 = (9.2385e-28)/2=4.619e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.543e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption, and the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual potential energies are zero, but I don't see how that's possible.

I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, but I'm not sure how that would be achieved.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 12 charges as zero, which would mean only considering the pairs between the 13th and the 12.

But in that case, the total U would be 5.536e-27 J, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all 13 charges, each contributing (2e), and all being at 2m from P, but that's not the case since the 13th is fixed at P.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on my calculations, the closest option would be option C (7.056e-27), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial setup. The problem says 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 are each 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. So perhaps the mutual potential energies are not considered, and the total U is 5.536e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27) but not exact.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in terms of eV instead of joules, but the options are in joules.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculations, the correct total potential energy is approximately 5.536e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J.


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system consisting of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Formula**: The potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).

2. **Charges and Distances**:
   - Each charge has \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), so \( q = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).
   - The 13th charge is fixed at \( P \), and the other 12 charges are each 2 meters away from \( P \).

3. **Pairs Involving the 13th Charge**:
   - The 13th charge interacts with each of the 12 charges at a distance of 2 meters. Each such pair contributes:
     \[
     U_{\text{pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
     \]
   - There are 12 such pairs, so the total energy for these pairs is:
     \[
     U_{\text{total, 13th}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
     \]

4. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from \( P \), but their mutual distances are not specified. Without explicit information about their arrangement, it is unclear how to compute their mutual potential energy. The problem likely assumes that their mutual distances are either negligible or that their contributions are ignored, as including them would require additional details.

5. **Calculation of \( U_{\text{total, 13th}} \)**:
   - Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
     \[
     U_{\text{total, 13th}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
     \]
     \[
     U_{\text{total, 13th}} = 24 \cdot 2.306 \times 10^{-28} = 5.534 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( 5.534 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 2.5 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the calculation or an assumption in the problem setup that was not explicitly stated.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, though the exact match is unclear due to potential assumptions or approximations in the problem.
