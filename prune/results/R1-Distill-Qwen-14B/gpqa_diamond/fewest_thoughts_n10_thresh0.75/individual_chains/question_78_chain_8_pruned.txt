Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this before, but I'm a little rusty, so let me think it through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r and time t. The charge q is moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're considering the fields at a time t which is later than the time tr when the charge was at the position that generated the field. 

Wait, so the setup is that the charge was at a position which, when connected to the observation point r, gives a vector d. Oh right, d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So d is r minus the position of the charge at time tr. Or maybe it's the other way around? I think d is the vector pointing from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr), yeah.

The problem is asking for the expressions for V and A at time t, with t > tr. So this is about retarded potentials, I think. Because when a charge is moving, the fields at a later point depend on the charge's state at an earlier time, which is why we have the concept of retarded time.

I remember that in the context of retarded potentials, the fields are calculated based on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time. The scalar and vector potentials are given by certain integrals involving the charge's motion.

Let me recall the formulas. The scalar potential V is typically (q/(4πε₀)) times the reciprocal of the distance from the charge to the observation point, but considering the charge's position at the retarded time. But wait, if the charge is moving, the distance might not just be r, but it's more involved due to the movement.

Wait, no. The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v might have a term that includes the velocity as well, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, in the static case (where charges aren't moving), the scalar potential is simply V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, the potentials involve the velocity because of the motion's effect on
