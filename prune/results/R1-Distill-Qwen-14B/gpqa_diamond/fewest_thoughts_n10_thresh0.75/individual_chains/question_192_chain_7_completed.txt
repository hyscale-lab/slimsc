Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem states: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and it has a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, I'm trying to visualize this setup. The conductor is neutral, so it has no net charge. The cavity is off-center, some distance s from the center. The charge q is inside this cavity.

I remember that in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves to cancel any internal fields. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so initially, there's no charge. But when we place a charge inside the cavity, things change.

Oh right, when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce a charge opposite to q. Because the charge q attracts the electrons in the conductor, making the inner surface have a charge of -q. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral, so the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance that. Wait, no, because the total charge on the conductor was zero. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) must have -q, so the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero. Wait, no, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to balance. Because the conductor's net charge is zero. So the total charge on conductor is (charge on inner surface) + (charge on outer surface) = 0. So if inner is -q, outer is +q.

Wait, but how does that work for the electric field outside the conductor?

I think that for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed within. So in this case, the outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center. So the electric field at a point outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/r², where r is the distance from the center of the conductor.

But wait, in this problem, the point P is outside the conductor, but the setup is more complicated because the cavity is off-center. So maybe the field isn't just the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, no, because the conductor is a spherical shell. The charge distribution on the outer surface is due to the charges induced by the inner surfaces. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface should still behave like a point charge regardless of where the inner charges are. Because the conductor is a sphere, any external points would see the field as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the field should depend only on the total charge on the conductor, which is +q, because the conductor had zero charge overall. Because the conductor's own charges are +q on the outer surface. So the electric field at P would be as if it's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the way the cavity is placed, and the point P's position relative to both the conductor and the cavity's center could complicate things. But wait, I'm trying to think about the Gaussian surface here. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge is +q, so the electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. Because L is greater than R, the Gaussian surface would enclose the outer charge.

But wait, the way the charge is placed is in the cavity, which is not at the center. So then, does that affect the external field? I don't think so because the conductor's outer surface charge is uniformly distributed if the conductor is a sphere. So regardless of where the internal charge is placed, the external field is as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor is a sphere, so the induced charges on the outer surface would be uniformly distributed, right? So for any point outside the conductor, the field would be the same as if the charge was concentrated at the center. So the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². That seems to fit. But let me make sure.

Wait, another approach: the charge inside the cavity is +q. The conductor being neutral, the inner surface of the cavity must have -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the point P is outside the conductor, so when considering the electric field at P, only the total charge on the conductor matters. So yes, the field would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / (L)^2.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. But the center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta. So l is the distance between the point P and the cavity's center, which is at s from conductor's center.

But would that affect the field at P? Since the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, the field outside only depends on the total charge. So the position of the inner charge relative to the conductor's center shouldn't affect the external field. So the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

So looking at the options, option B is the right one.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is off-center, with its center separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$, and both $L$ and $l$ are greater than $R$.

To solve this, we consider the following:

1. **Charge Distribution on the Conductor**:  
   Since the conductor is initially neutral, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Here, the total charge on the conductor is $+q$, which resides on its outer surface. Regardless of the position of the cavity or the internal charge, the field outside the conductor is as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Field at Point $P$**:  
   Since point $P$ is outside the conductor, the electric field at $P$ is determined by the total charge on the conductor, $+q$, and is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**:  
   The positions of the cavity and the internal charge do not affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface charge ensures that the field outside depends only on the total charge $+q$.

Among the options provided, the correct expression for the electric field at point $P$ is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
