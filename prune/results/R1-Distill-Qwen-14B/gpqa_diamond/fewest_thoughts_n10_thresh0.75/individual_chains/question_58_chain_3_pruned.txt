Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can cause problems, so regularization helps to make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the divergences. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or because they have certain properties that prevent these divergences.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory, which is a quantum theory of gravity. I think string theories are supposed to be finite because they don't have the same divergent loop diagrams as, say, quantum field theories. Wait, but I might be getting this confused. I remember that in string theory, the perturbative expansion (like Feynman diagrams) involves strings rather than point particles, which might lead to better behavior. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences. But wait, isn't string theory still dealing with higher-dimensional objects and maybe some other issues? I'm not entirely sure. I'll keep this in mind and check the other options.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD does require renormalization, which is a process related to regularization. Renormalization handles the infinities by absorbing them into physical parameters like mass and charge. So QCD definitely needs regularization at high energies because of the divergences in loop calculations. So option B is out.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's the first quantum field theory that was developed, and I remember that QED does require renormalization. The calculations for things like the electron's charge result in divergent integrals, so you have to use techniques like regularization to deal with those infinities. So QED (option C) also needs regularization. So C isn't the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So in classical electromagnetism
