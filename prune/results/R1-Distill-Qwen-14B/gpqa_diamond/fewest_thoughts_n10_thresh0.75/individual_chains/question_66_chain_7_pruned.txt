Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with SMEFT, but I remember it's a framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these. I think I remember that the Standard Model respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT probably maintains those unless the operators explicitly break them.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry. I think that's a big one. All the operators in the Standard Model are Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the Standard Model includes Poincare, SMEFT must too. So option 2 should be correct. Wait, but sometimes people get Lorentz and Poincare confused. Poincare is the full symmetry including translations and Lorentz transformations. But in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they must respect local symmetries, which includes Poincare. So I think 1 and 2 are both correct. But wait, the question is whether all operators must respect which symmetries. Wait, SMEFT operators are organized in terms of Lorentz structures. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Poincare is more general, but if Lorentz is already considered, does Poincare automatically hold? Or is it a separate condition?
