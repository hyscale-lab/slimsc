Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let's see what it's about. So, the question involves some plant genes and their role in resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. They've done some experiments with knockout mutants and double mutants to see how these genes interact.

Alright, let's break down the problem. The setup is that they have three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance levels are given for each. The wild-type has 100% resistance, so lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

The data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less than wild-type but not as bad as some others.

- g2: 0% resistance. So, completely susceptible. That's a big effect.

- g3: 50% resistance. So, half the resistance of wild-type.

Double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's really low.

- g2g3: 0% resistance.

- g1g2: 0% resistance.

Hmm. Also, it's known that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, perhaps G2 is the TF, since its mutation knocks resistance down to 0%, which is a strong effect.

Wait, but let's look at the double mutants first. Because when you have double mutants, their resistance might tell you about the gene hierarchy. If the double mutant is more severe than either single mutant, that could imply something about their interaction.

Let me think: when you have two genes, if knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout, it could mean they're in the same pathway. Or, if the double mutant is the same as one of the single knockouts, that suggests epistatic relationships.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. Both single mutants g1 (75%) and g2 (0%) are in the parent. So when you have g1g2, it's 0%, which is the same as g2. So that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the double mutant's phenotype matches the more severe one, which is G2's. So, if G2 is downstream, then G1's function must be upstream. Because the pathway is blocked at G2, so even if G1 is working, G2's knockout would make the pathway fail.

Similarly, g2g3: 0% resistance. Both g2 and g3 are single knockouts with 0 and 50%, respectively. The double is 0%, which is the same as g2. So again, G2 is epistatic to G3.

What about g1g3? Their single knockouts are 75% and 50%. The double is 10%, which is worse than either. So their functions are additive or synergistic. But why?

Wait, the question says that one gene is a transcription factor upstream. So perhaps G2 is the TF. Because g2 is completely susceptible, and in the double mutants involving G2, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is acting upstream of the others.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor, then in the plant's resistance pathway, G2 is upstream. So if G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't be activated, leading to no resistance.

But wait, what about the single mutant g1? It's at 75%, which is lower than wild type, but not zero. So perhaps G1 contributes to resistance but isn't the only one. Similarly, g3 is at 50%, which is less than half.

So, without G2, the resistance is gone. So G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and G3. But for the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the effect is more severe. That suggests they might be acting redundantly. Or maybe they're in parallel pathways, so knocking both out makes the effect additive. Hmm.

Wait, redundancy is when two genes do the same thing, so knocking both out would have a similar effect as knocking just one. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than either. So redundancy might not be the case. Alternatively, if they're in parallel pathways, knocking both would lead to a more severe phenotype.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2. So when you have g2, they're both non-functional, hence 0% resistance. But if
