Okay, so I have this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the situation is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they sequenced the target gene in all mutants. The mutations are in the first exon area. The question is which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations there could affect the protein product. The anti-nutritional compound is probably a protein, so disrupting the gene's function would stop its synthesis.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the first exon. I need to see which mutation leads to a premature stop codon, causing a truncated protein that might not function. Alternatively, a frameshift could disrupt the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but let me look at the sequences. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. The TGA is the stop codon at the end.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Comparing to the wild type, let's see where the changes are.

Looking at the first part:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGG...

Wait, maybe I should line them up:

Wild type exon 1 starts: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Comparing the first few nucleotides.

At position 3 (wild type has TTT, mutant has TCT). Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the changes happen.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the sequences diverge.

Looking at each mutant's sequence:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACAT... etc.

Wait, perhaps I should break it down into codons.

The wild type starts with ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), then CTA (Leu), then G
