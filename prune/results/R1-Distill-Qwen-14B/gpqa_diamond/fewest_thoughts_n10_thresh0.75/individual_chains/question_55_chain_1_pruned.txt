Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR question. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the 1H NMR data and asks me to identify the unknown compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

Alright, I'll start by recalling what these structures look like. Wait, propenyl has a double bond in a three-carbon chain, right? So propenyl acetate would have the structure where the acetate is attached to a propenyl group. Similarly, butenyl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Let me think about the possible structures for each option. Cis-propenyl acetate would have the two substituents on the same side of the double bond. Trans would have them opposite. Same with butenyl.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), and 1.6 (3H, d).

Wait, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. That seems like a long coupling, which is typical for a trans coupling in a double bond. Because in trans, the protons are on opposite sides, so the coupling is larger, like around 16 Hz or more. If it were cis, the coupling would be around 10-12 Hz, I think.

So the proton at 7.0 is part of a double bond. Let me imagine a structure where a proton is coupled to another with J=16 Hz. Maybe it's a trans double bond. So perhaps it's a trans configuration.

Looking at the other peaks. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Maybe that's a vinyl proton adjacent to something else. Like, maybe an acetate group attached.

The 2.1 ppm triple is a singlet, which probably is the acetate methyl group. So that's CH3COO- attached somewhere.

The 1.6 ppm is a triplet? Wait, no, it's a doublet. So 3H, doublet. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a double bond. Like CH2CH2CH3 or CH2CH(CH3). Wait, no, but in either case, attached to a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2OAc or CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc? No, wait, but propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, so acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Alternatively, the structure could be CH2CH2, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the coupling.

So the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which is one proton. If it's a trans double bond, maybe it's a trans configuration in the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, let's break down the possible structures. Let me try drawing each option.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, that's the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2.

In that case, the protons on the double bond are CH2-CH-CH2-OAc. So the two protons on the double bond are adjacent to each other.

Wait, in propenyl, the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the
