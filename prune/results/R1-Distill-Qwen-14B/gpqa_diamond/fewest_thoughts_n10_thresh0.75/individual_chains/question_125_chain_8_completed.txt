Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, an isotropic oscillator means the potential is the same in all directions, so it's symmetric in x, y, z. Or in spherical coordinates, it's just r squared.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic oscillator are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in 3D, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number. Oh, right, the energy is actually E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction has its own quantum number, and they add up.

But wait, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the total quantum number. Oh yeah, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. So if we let n = nx + ny + nz, then E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So each state is characterized by the sum n, and the degeneracy (number of states) is determined by how many ways we can have nx + ny + nz = n, where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers.

Now, the third excited state. Wait, excited states start counting from the ground state as the first state. So ground state is the lowest, which is n=0. The first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state is n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, 3 is the sum n, so E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part.

Now the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. That is, the degeneracy. The degeneracy is the number of distinct ways to get nx + ny + nz = 3.

Hmm, how do I calculate that? The number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = 3. Oh, that's a combinatorial problem. The formula for the number of solutions is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) which is 10. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is (n + k -1 choose k-1), where n is the total and k the number of variables. So here, n=3, k=3. So (3 + 3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So 10 eigenfunctions. So the degeneracy is 10.

Putting it together, the energy is (9/2) ħω and the degeneracy is 10. Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. That looks correct.

Option C is 3 for the eigenfunctions, which is way too low. So the answer should be A.


In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \), and the energy levels are quantized as \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways to partition \( n \) into \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which is determined by the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{n + 2}{2} \).

For the third excited state, the total quantum number is \( n = 3 \) (since the ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), and so on). The energy of this state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy is the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \), which is:

\[
\binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

From the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) is correct.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3 \) is incorrect because the degeneracy is not 3.
- **Options B and D**: The energy expressions are incorrect.
