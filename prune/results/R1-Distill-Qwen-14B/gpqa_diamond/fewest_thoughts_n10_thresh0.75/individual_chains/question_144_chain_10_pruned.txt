Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me a meson X with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a very tiny distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, how do I find the decay distance? I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. But wait, Γ is given here in MeV, and ħ is in J·s units. I'll need to convert units properly.

But wait, there's another thing. The mean decay distance also depends on the velocity of the particle. Because the lifetime is the proper time, and the particle is moving, so the actual lifetime observed is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, so the mean decay length L is given by L = γ * β * c * τ. Where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c.

So I need to calculate the velocity of the meson X. To find γ and β, I can use the energy and mass of the particle. The total energy E is related to mass and momentum. The formula is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / c. Wait, let me think about units. Oh, but since everything is in GeV and MeV, perhaps I can work in natural units where c=1, but I need to be cautious with unit conversions.

Wait, the production energy E_X is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is higher than the rest mass, so the meson is moving relativistically.

First, let's calculate the momentum. Let me write down the formula:

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, no, perhaps better to re-arrange:

p c = sqrt( E² -
