Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various values in meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles don't live forever; they decay over time. The mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy and time are inversely related. So, the wider the width, the shorter the lifetime.

So the formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Its value in GeV·s is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, to compute τ, I need Γ in GeV. Oh right, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but how do I get the decay distance? Oh right, the mean decay distance is the product of the velocity of the particle and the mean lifetime. So, distance L = v * τ.

But wait, what's the velocity of the particle? Since the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass m_X=1.2 GeV, we can find its velocity.

Relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So, γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but units here. E and m are both in GeV and GeV/c²? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work in
