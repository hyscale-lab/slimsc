Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem, but I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts. Let me see if I can break it down step by step. The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ in an extended Standard Model, considering radiative corrections. Hmm, right, pseudo-Goldstone bosons usually come into play when you have spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Looking at the Lagrangian provided, I see terms like i\bar{N}_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R, which suggests that the singlet fermions N are being described. Then there's a scalar doublet S and a singlet scalar φ. The potential V(φ, S, H) must be where the symmetry breaking happens. The given vev is ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², so φ gets a vacuum expectation value (vev) of x, and another scalar h (maybe the Higgs?) with vev v.

Wait, the problem mentions the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. So this must be part of a multi-scalar sector. In the Standard Model, the Higgs is a doublet, leading to several Higgs bosons: the CP-even Higgses, the CP-odd A, and the charged H±. But when you have additional scalars, like maybe in a two-Higgs doublet model or something similar, you get more Higgs bosons.

In the model here, S is a scalar doublet. If S gets a vev, then φ is a singlet with its own vev. So perhaps φ is the main Higgs here? Or maybe S is the Higgs. Wait, the vev is given as ⟨φ⟩, which is x, and ⟨h⟩ is v. Hmm, maybe h is another scalar, like the Higgs from the S doublet?

Wait, the potential V(φ, S, H) must have terms that lead to symmetry breaking. The singlet φ with a vev x and h with v. Maybe this is a scenario with two Higgs fields, like a type of model where there's a complex scalar φ and a Higgs S.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a doublet, and its vev gives mass to the W and Z bosons. But here, we have another scalar φ with a vev. So perhaps the model is similar to the inert doublet model, where an additional Higgs is introduced. But I'm not entirely sure.

The question is about the mass of H₂, a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is broken spontaneously, but the Goldstone boson is '
