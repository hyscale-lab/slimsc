Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about binary star systems and figuring out the mass ratio between them. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their motion can be observed through radial velocity variations.

So the problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are given for each system. 

In system_1, the RV variations are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Oh wait, the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

I think the key here is to find the mass of each system and then compare them. But how do I get the mass from the given data? I remember that in binary stars, the more massive star is closer to the center of mass, so it has a smaller orbit. The less massive star moves more, so it has a larger RV amplitude.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula, I think, is K = (v) = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, I might have heard that the mass function relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a binary system, the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) is equal to (M2/M1) because of the center of mass condition. Since M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. So M1/M2 = a2/a1 = (K2/K1), because K is proportional to a.

Wait, because velocity (v) is 2πa/P. So K is proportional to a, so K1/K2 = (a1/a2). And since M1 a1 = M2 a2, then M1/M2 = a2/a1 = K2/K1.

So for system_1, let's see. The two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say star A has K1=10, star B has K2=5. Then M_A / M_B = K2 / K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A = 0.5 M_B. So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B.

Similarly for system_2, RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. Let's say star C has Kc=15, star D has Kd=10. Then M_C / M_D = Kd / Kc = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So M_C = (2/3) M_D. So total mass of system_2 is M_C + M_D = (2/3) M_D + M_D = (5/3) M_D.

Wait, but how do I relate this to the periods? Because the period is the same for both stars in a binary system. The period is the orbital period, which is the same for both stars. So for each system, the sum of the velocities (K1 + K2) is related to the orbital velocity, but I'm not sure if that's directly needed here.

Wait, I think the mass function relates the velocities to the mass. The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ). But since both stars are in the
