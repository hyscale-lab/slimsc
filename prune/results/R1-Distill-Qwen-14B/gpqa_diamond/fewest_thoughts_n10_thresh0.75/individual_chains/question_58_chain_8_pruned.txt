Okay, so I've got this question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. The question is asking which theory never needs regularization at high energies. Let's think through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And since it's a theory that includes gravity, maybe it doesn't have the same issues as other quantum field theories. But wait, I'm not so sure. Do string theories require regularization? Or do they handle things differently because they're background-independent? Or maybe they use other methods like the AdS/CFT correspondence. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, so it's similar to Yang-Mills. I recall that QCD calculations often involve dealing with divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So they must use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established theory, and I think it does require regularization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. For example, the electron self-energy has divergences which are handled by renormalization. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one.
