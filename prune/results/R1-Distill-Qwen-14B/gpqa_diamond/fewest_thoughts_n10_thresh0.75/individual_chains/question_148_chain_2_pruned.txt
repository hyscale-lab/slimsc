Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm. It's about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances A1 to A5 and their reactions, and I need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me start by breaking down the information. So, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. That suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe a fluoride with a high oxidation state.

A2 has an oF (I think that's the oxidation number of fluorine) of 31.96%. Wait, oxidation number is usually a whole number, but maybe they mean the percentage of fluorine in terms of its atomic weight or something else. Or perhaps it's the percentage composition. Oh wait, no, the oF notation might stand for the oxidation state. Hmm, but 31.96% as an oxidation state doesn't make sense because fluorine typically has oxidation states like -1, +1, +3, etc. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's the percentage by mass of fluorine in A2. Let me think.

Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%" which probably is a percentage. So the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 is about 31.96%. So, that's approximately 32% fluorine. That could help in determining the formula.

Substance A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So A3 is likely a simple fluoride, maybe YF. But it can also interact with xenon, which might mean it's a strong enough oxidizing agent or reacts under certain conditions.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Hmm, I'm not sure what that implies. Maybe A5 is something like a salt that hydrolyzes upon contact with water. Or perhaps it's a more complex reaction.

Let me think about possible elements Y. Since we're dealing with fluorine compounds, and they're binary, Y is probably a non-metal or metal. But given that it's producing various fluorides, maybe Y is something like chlorine, but wait, no, because the problem says binary compounds with fluorine. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen? Or maybe another halogen? Or wait, perhaps Y is iodine. Or maybe it's a metal like sodium, but that's a stretch because sodium fluoride is a simple salt.

Wait, considering that A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas and quite unreactive. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. The only fluorine compounds I know that are strong oxidizing agents are things like F2 itself, but that's not a compound. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF3 or something similar—but wait, that's a fluoride with chlorine. Alternatively, maybe it's a fluorinated oxygen compound, but that's not a binary compound with fluorine. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is chlorine. Because chlorine forms several fluorides. Let me think: ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. Are there five binary compounds? Let's see: ClF, ClF3, ClF5, maybe ClF7, but I'm not sure if they all exist. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about Y being Cl.

Alternatively, if Y is oxygen, then O and F form OF2 and OF, but that's only two compounds. Not five. So Y is probably another element.

Wait, another thought: Xenon is mentioned. Xenon can form several fluorides. So perhaps Y is Xenon. Because then the compounds would be binary fluorides of xenon. But the question says that A1 oxidizes xenon. So if Y were Xenon, that might not make sense because A1 would be a fluoride of Xenon, which might not oxidize another Xenon. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps Y is
