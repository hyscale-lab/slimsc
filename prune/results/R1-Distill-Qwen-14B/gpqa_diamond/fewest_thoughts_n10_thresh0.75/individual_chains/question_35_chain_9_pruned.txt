Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. 

The problem says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, I remember that matrices like this often relate to spin operators in quantum mechanics. Spin matrices for electrons, muons, etc., which are spin-½ particles. So S must be related to the Pauli matrices or something similar.

Let me write down the matrix S first. So, S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Right, and c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S. Therefore, the Ay matrix would be:

c*0   c*(-i)
c*i   c*0

Which simplifies to:

[ 0      -i c ]
[ i c     0   ]

Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in, Ay becomes:

[ 0      -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0 ]

So the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and off-diagonal elements involving h and i.

The question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Also, the options are given, and I need to pick which statement is correct.
