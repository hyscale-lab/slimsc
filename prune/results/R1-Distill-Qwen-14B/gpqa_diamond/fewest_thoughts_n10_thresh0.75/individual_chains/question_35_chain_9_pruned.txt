Alright, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down.

So, the problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). Oh wait, I remember that these kinds of matrices are related to Pauli matrices. Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used in spin-1/2 systems, right?

Wait, the Pauli matrices, sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Let me recall their forms. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh, right! So the S matrix given here is exactly sigma_y. So S is the sigma_y matrix. That makes sense because the given matrix for S matches the structure of sigma_y.

So A_y is c multiplied by sigma_y. Since c is h/(4π), then A_y = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Wait, but I remember that Pauli matrices have known eigenvalues. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because, for example, sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, since A_y is c times sigma_y, the eigenvalues of A_y will be c times the eigenvalues of sigma_y. So eigenvalues a would be c*1 and c*(-1), so +c and -c.

Let me compute c. c is h/(4π). So a = h/(4π) * (±1). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Wait, looking at the options, let's see which ones match.

Looking at option A: it says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2π h, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but eigenvalues for A_y are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers, right? Because sigma_y has real eigenvalues, so when multiplied by a real constant, the eigenvalues are still real. So the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, which doesn't make sense. So A is incorrect.

Option B: imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real ±1. Wait, no, because the eigenvalues are real, the imaginary parts are zero. So B is also incorrect because their eigenvalues have imaginary components. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, but wait, no, sigma_y's eigenvalues are real? Wait no! Wait, sigma_y is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvalues are real. So A_y is a multiple of a Hermitian matrix, so it's Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real. So the eigenvalues are real. So any option that says eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts must be wrong.

So options A and B are out because they suggest eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be right.

Now, options C and D are left. Let's go through them.

Option C: The eigenfunction of A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm, A^2 would be (A_y)^2. Since A_y is proportional to sigma_y, (A_y)^2 = c² sigma_y^2. Sigma_y squared is identity matrix, because for Pauli matrices, sigma_i squared is I. So sigma_y^2 is I. So (A_y)^2
