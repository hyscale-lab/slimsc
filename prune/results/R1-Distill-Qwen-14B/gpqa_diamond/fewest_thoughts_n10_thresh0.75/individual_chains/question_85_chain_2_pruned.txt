Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, the star's luminosity, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so albedo won't affect the ratio. That's good, one variable less to worry about.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Yeah, but since albedo is same, that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the key here is finding the ratio of their distances from the star. Because the closer a planet is, the hotter it will be. But how do I find their distances?

Wait, the problem mentions the radial velocity method. Oh right! The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star's wobble. But how does that connect to the orbital distance? I think the RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the distance.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is: K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but wait, simplifying because e is 0 (circular orbit) and sin i is 1 (edge-on, which is the case for transit method), so it simplifies.

Wait another approach: The Doppler shift (change in wavelength) is proportional to the velocity of the star. The problem gives the shifts in the forbidden line for each planet. So the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the velocity via Δλ/λ = v/c. Where v is the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

So for each planet, the maximum Doppler shift will relate to their semi-amplitude velocities. The larger the shift, the higher the velocity, and the larger the planet's mass (since K is proportional to M_planet * sin i / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but P is the orbital period
