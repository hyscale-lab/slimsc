Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1. So, each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. So, the state is |l1, l2, l, m> which is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, but wait, when you couple two angular momenta, the total angular momentum quantum number l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since both l1 and l2 are 1, the possible l values are 0,1,2. So, in this case, the total l is 2, which is the maximum possible. That makes sense.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We're supposed to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each L_z measurement would yield -ħ for each electron. 

I remember that the orbital angular momentum operators are L1z and L2z. So, the eigenvalues are m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron. For a p orbital, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but in the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m>, the m is the total magnetic quantum number, so m = m1 + m2. In this case, the given state has m = -1. So, m_total = m1 + m2 = -1. 

But the question is about the individual m1 and m2 values. So, we need to find the possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to m_total = -1, and then check if both m1 and m2 are -1, which would give each L_z eigenvalue as -ħ. But wait, since each electron is in a p orbital, m1 and m2 can only be -1, 0, +1.

So, let me think: what are all possible
