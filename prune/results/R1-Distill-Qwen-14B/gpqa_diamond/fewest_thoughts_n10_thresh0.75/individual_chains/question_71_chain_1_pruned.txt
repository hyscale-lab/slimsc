Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I think that's more about how they were detected, not so much about their properties here.

The important part is that they're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet has a longer period. But I need to find the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it emits. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular, e (eccentricity) is zero. But the question says all planets have the same albedo, so that term cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the formula simplifies. Let me write that down. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but more simply, the temperature depends on the square root of the star's temperature and the planet's distance. But wait, since all planets are orbiting the same star, the star's luminosity (L) and radius (R_star) would be the same for all. So the main factor here is the distance 'a' from the star.

Wait, but wait, in the equilibrium temperature formula, the distance 'a' is in the denominator because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. So flux F is L/(4πa²). The planet absorbs F*(1 - albedo)/4, since it's a blackbody and only absorbs over the cross-section (area πr²) and emits from the whole surface (4πr²). So the absorbed power is (L/(4πa²)) * (1 - albedo) * π r² /4. The emitted power is sigma * T^4 * 4π r². Setting them equal gives T^4 proportional to L/(16π sigma a²) * (1 - albedo). But since all planets have the same albedo and same star, the ratio of T depends only on 1/sqrt(a), because T is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4) * (1/(1 - albedo))^(1/4). Hmm, but wait, L is the same, so for the ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2, the L terms would cancel.

So the key is the ratio of their distances. The closer the planet is to the star, the higher its equilibrium temperature.

So I need to find the ratio of the distances a4 / a2. Since the periods are in a ratio, I can use Kepler's third law, which states that (P^2)/(a^3) is constant for planets around the same star. So (a1/a2)^3 = (P1/P2)^2. Wait, no, let me think. Kepler's law: (a^3)/(P^2) = constant. So for two planets, a1^3 / P1^2 = a2^3 / P2^2. Rearranging, (a1/a2)^3 = (P1^2)/(P2^2). So a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3).

Alternatively, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3).

The periods are given in ratios: Planet 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet 2's period is 2 units, Planet 4's is 3.5 units. So P4/P2 = 3
