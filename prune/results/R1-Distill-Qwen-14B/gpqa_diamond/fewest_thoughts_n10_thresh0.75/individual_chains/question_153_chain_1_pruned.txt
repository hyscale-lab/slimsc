Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This results in the formation of an enolate intermediate. The reaction typically involves a Michael donor (the nucleophile) and a Michael acceptor (the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl).

Looking at part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, sodium ethoxide is a strong base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. It can act as a nucleophile. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, so it's probably the Michael acceptor.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (from the donor) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the acrylate, the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond formed between the alpha carbon of the malonate and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. The methyl acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but with a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so it's CH2CH-CO2Me with a p-tolyl group attached. Or wait, wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3 in E configuration. So when the Michael addition happens, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(CO2Me)2-) would attack the beta carbon, which is the CH2 in CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but with a substituent. Wait, let me get the structure right.

Actually, I think the acceptor is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the C=C between the two CH2 groups: CH2-
