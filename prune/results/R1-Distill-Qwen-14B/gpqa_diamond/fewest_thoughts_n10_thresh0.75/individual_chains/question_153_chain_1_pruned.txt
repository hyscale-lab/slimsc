Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion or some other strong nucleophile. 

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. I need to find the reactants and major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Oh wait, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. It probably deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. 

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2O, I think. It's a diethyl malonate analog, so when deprotonated, it forms a strong nucleophilic enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the p-tolyl group is on the 3 position. Let me draw it. So the acrylate is CH2CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So it's probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the alpha carbon. Maybe it's CH2=C-O... No, wait, the correct structure for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but in this case, the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OEt? No, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. So the structure would be CH
