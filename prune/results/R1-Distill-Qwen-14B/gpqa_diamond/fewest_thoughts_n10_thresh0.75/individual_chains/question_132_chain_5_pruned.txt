Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let's read it again.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds (each has the formula C10H14) shows two signals as singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, first, I should probably think about the molecular formula. Both compounds are C10H14. Wait, aromatic compounds with that formula... Let me see. Benzene is C6H6. So each compound has four substituents, because 6 (from benzene) +4*(CH3 groups) gives C10H14? Wait, because each CH3 contributes one C and three H, but wait:

Wait, benzene is C6H6. If substituents are all methyl groups, each CH3 adds one C and three H. So four methyl groups would add 4C and 12H, making C10H18. But our formula is C10H14. Oh wait, that's not matching. Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ethyl groups or something else. Wait, no, the options include some diethyl, let me think.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, so the first three options have two tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has one tetramethyl and one diethyl. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Each tetramethylbenzene is C6H6 +4CH3 = C1
