Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to figure out what starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, wait. So, the product from A is R configuration and from B is S. So, the same compound but enantiomers? Interesting. So, the reaction must be affecting the stereochemistry somehow.

Looking at the reagents: For A, the reagent is LiBH4 with H+. For B, it's BH3 with H+. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones and aldehydes. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but I think it's more selective. Oh wait, wait—BH3 is typically used for ketone reductions but maybe in a different way. Or wait, maybe this is about the conditions leading to different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, no, wait. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone, right? So maybe the starting material was a ketone as well, but perhaps a more complex structure. Or maybe it's a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, you typically get a secondary alcohol. But the product here is a ketone. Oh wait, no—wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, so it's a cyclic ether with a ketone group. So the structure would be a pyran ring where one of the CH2 groups is a ketone (O=C-O). Wait, no, pyran is an oxygen-containing six-membered ring, right? So 2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone at position 2, and the ring would be partially hydrogenated.

So, thinking about how to form that. Maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester or a cyclic ketone that, upon reduction, becomes this product. Alternatively, perhaps
