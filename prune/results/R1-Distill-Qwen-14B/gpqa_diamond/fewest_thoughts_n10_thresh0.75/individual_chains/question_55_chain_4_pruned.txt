Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me see what I can remember about NMR and how to approach this. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all some form of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm.

First, I'll look at the NMR data given. The chemical shifts are:

- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, doublet of quartets
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet

I need to figure out what each of these signals corresponds to.

Starting with the singlet at 2.1 ppm. That's usually a good sign for an acetate group. The ester carbonyl in acetates typically makes the adjacent methyl group appear around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because there's no splitting since it's attached to an oxygen in the carbonyl. So that's probably the methyl group from the acetate (like OAc).

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. A doublet suggests it's a methyl group next to a CH2 or maybe a CH with some coupling. Wait, but 1.6 is a bit low for a methyl attached to CH2—maybe it's a geminal group or part of an ethyl or propenyl group. Or perhaps it's a methyl adjacent to a double bond. For example, in an allylic position. So maybe this is a CH2CH2CH3 group, but the splitting might come from coupling with another CH.

Wait, the doublet at 1.6 ppm with 3H—could it be a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to a double bond? Like in an allyl group. So maybe the structure has a CH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a geminal di-substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's the CH3 group in a propenyl group. Hmm.

Now the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets (dq) with 1H. That area (around 5.5) is typical for protons near a double bond or an aromatic ring. But wait, there's another peak at 7.0 ppm, which is more aromatic. Wait, but 7.0 is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling. J=16 is big—like for a trans coupling in a trans double bond. Or maybe a coupling between two aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring? But I don't see any other signals in that region except the 7.0 ppm, so maybe it's a double bond.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm is a singlet? No, it's 1H, d, J=16. So it's a doublet. So perhaps it's a proton on a double bond, coupled to another proton across the double bond. Like a trans configuration. So maybe the structure has an E-configuration (trans) double bond,
