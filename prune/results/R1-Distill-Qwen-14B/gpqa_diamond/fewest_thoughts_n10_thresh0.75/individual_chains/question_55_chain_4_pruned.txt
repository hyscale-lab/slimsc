Okay, so I have this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are various propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I need to remember what the structures of these compounds look like. Acetate esters have the structure R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So in this case, the R groups are either propenyl or butenyl, and whether they're cis or trans.

Let me list the options again:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Wait, but wait, propenyl and butenyl have different chain lengths. Propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, no, actually propenyl is CH2=CHCH3, but when attached as an ester, the structure might vary. Hmm, maybe I should draw the structures.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR data given. The 1H NMR shows four signals:

1. 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
2. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
3. 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
4. 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Let me think about each peak.

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is probably the acetoxy group's methyl. Because in acetates, the OAc group is -O-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the ester group is usually O-CO-O-R. Oh, no, wait, acetate ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of an acetate ester is R-O-CO-CH3. Wait, no, wait. For example, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. So the OAc group is O-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The general structure of an acetate ester is R-O-CO-CH3, but wait, wait, no, the acetate is the ester where the acid part is acetic acid. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. Oh wait, no. Wait, the ester is formed from acetic acid (CH3COOH) and an alcohol (like R-OH). So the ester is CH3CO-O-R. So the carbonyl is between the CH3 and the O, so the O is connected to R.

Wait, in the ester group, there's the carbonyl (C=O), then the ester oxygen, and then the R group. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-O-R.

So in the NMR, the OCH3 (methyl group attached to oxygen in the acetic part) would be split as a singlet because it's a -CH3 attached to an electronegative atom
