Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait a minute, wait. How does that work? Oh right, when spots are present, they are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when a star has spots, the total emitted light decreases because those spots are emitting less. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm, maybe the way the spots affect the average temperature is by reducing the total flux, leading to a lower effective temperature as measured from afar.

But the question isn't about the star's properties directly. It's about the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

So, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and n2 in level 2. In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, or is it n1/n2? Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is usually written as n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where j is the higher energy level.

So, if level 2 is higher than level 1, E2 > E1. Then, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2-E1.

But in this case, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Hmm. Let me think about that.

Wait, let me get the setup right. The ratio observed is n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when there are spots, n1/n2 is smaller than when there are no spots. That means that when the star is cooler overall (with spots), the ratio of lower level to higher level is lower. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (n1)/(n2). Let's think about the Boltzmann equation. If the temperature is lower, what happens to n2 compared to n1? Because the exponential factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), so if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term decreases. So, n2/n1 would be smaller, meaning n2 is smaller relative to n1. Which implies that n1/n2 is larger. Oh wait, but the problem says when the star has spots
