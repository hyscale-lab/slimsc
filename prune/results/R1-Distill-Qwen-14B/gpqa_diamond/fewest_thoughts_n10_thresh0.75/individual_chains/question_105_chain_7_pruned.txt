Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. The problem is about photometric observations showing brightness variations, and how this might mimic an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude as these spots.

Wait, the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of a planet needed to give the same amplitude? So the observed brightness variation is caused by the spots, but we're comparing it to a planet transit, right?

Hmm, so I need to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and set that equal to the change caused by a planet transit, then solve for the planet's radius.

Let me recall: when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star.

But for the star spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the brightness variations are due to the spots being either on the visible hemisphere or not.

Wait, but in this case, only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere may come into view. The brightness variation would depend on how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, the star's filling factor is 20%, but that's the area of the spots relative to the star's surface. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So during the rotation, the observed brightness will dip when the spots are facing us.

Wait, no. Let me think. If one hemisphere is covered in spots, and the star is rotating, then the spots would rotate into and out of view. So
