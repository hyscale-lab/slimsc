Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each with different possibilities for A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So that's acetone with two methyl groups? Or maybe it's (CH2)2CO? Wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So it's a ketone.

So the reaction is between a ketone and NaCN. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism involves the nucleophile (CN-) attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in the product, there's a hydroxyl group as well as a nitrile group. Oh wait, wait. Let me look at the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be HOCH2C(CH3)CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2CH2)CN. Wait, but the product is
