Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. And the stability constants given are for different complexes. Stability constants are for the formation of complexes, so each beta represents how much the complex forms.

I remember that the stability constant (beta) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For a general case, the complex would be Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}, and the beta is the product of the formation steps. But wait, the way the problem is presented, the betas are for each successive addition of SCN-.

Wait, let me clarify. The stability constants are given as beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4. I think each beta corresponds to the formation of a complex with n ligands. So
