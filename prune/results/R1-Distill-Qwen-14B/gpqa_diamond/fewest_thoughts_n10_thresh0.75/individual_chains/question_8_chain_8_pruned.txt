Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to get all the details right.

So, the setup is that they did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-outs (mutants) for each and some double mutants. They know that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. They're testing resistance to the anthracnose pathogen. The wild type has 100% resistance, but the mutants have varying percentages.

The data given are:
- g1: 75% (so less than wild type)
- g2: 0% (complete loss of resistance)
- g3: 50%
- double mutants:
   g1g3: 10%
   g2g3: 0%
   g1g2: 0%

The question is about the gene interactions. The options involve things like transcription factors, pleiotropy, epistasis, and gene redundancy.

First, I need to remember what these terms mean. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the pathway might be A â†’ B, and knocking out A would mask the effect of B.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that plays into this question. Maybe it's when a gene affects multiple downstream genes.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than each alone.

So let's think about each mutant.

Wild type is 100% resistant. So any mutation that reduces resistance is bad.

g1 is 75%: So the plant is less resistant than wild type, but still has some resistance. Maybe G1 is a gene that contributes to resistance but isn't the only one.

g2 is 0% resistance: So the plant is completely susceptible. This suggests that G2 is critical. If G2 is knocked out, the resistance is gone. So G2 might be a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. Because if G2 is upstream, and without it, none of the downstream genes are expressed, leading to no resistance.

g3 is 50%: So it's half as resistant as wild type. So G3's product might be involved in resistance, but perhaps not the main factor.

Now, looking at the double mutants.

g1g2: 0% resistance. Both g1 and g2 are knocked out here. Since g2 alone is 0%, maybe knocking out g1 doesn't make it worse, but when you have both, it's 0%. Wait, but g2 alone is already 0%, so the double mutant with g1g2 is also 0%. That might not tell us much. Maybe G1 is downstream of G2? Or maybe G2 is upstream.

g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both g1 and g3 are knocked out, it's even worse than either alone. Because g1 is 75% and g3 is 50% so their combination is 10%, which is even lower. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in the same pathway but perhaps additively. Like, they're redundant or perhaps they're in parallel pathways? Or maybe they work together.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So knocking out both g2 and g3 gives the same as g2 alone. So when you add g3 knockout to g2 knockout, the resistance doesn't get worse than when just g2 is out. That suggests that maybe G3 is downstream of G2 or that G3's function is dependent on G2. Because without G2, G3's presence doesn't add anything. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G3.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then without G2, G3's function isn't expressed. So when G2 is knocked out, G3 isn't working either because it's not being activated. So in that case, g3 would be 50% but g2 is 0%. But g2g3 is also 0%, so perhaps in the absence of G2, whether G3 is present or not doesn't matter. So that suggests that G3 is downstream of G2.

Wait, so the double mutant g2g3 has the same effect as g2 alone. So the presence of a nonfunctional G3 doesn't make it worse. So that suggests that G3 is either downstream of G2 or doesn't contribute when G2 is absent. So if G2 is a transcription factor for G3, then when G2 is knocked out, G3 isn't expressed, so knocking out G3 in that case doesn't change anything because it's already nonfunctional.

So the presence of g2 knockout (0%) and g2g3 also 0% suggests that G2 is upstream of G3. Because without G2, G3 doesn't function, so adding the g3 knockout doesn't make it worse.

Now looking at g1g3: 10%. So when G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and when both are out, the resistance drops more. Alternatively, maybe G1 is in a different pathway than G2 and G3.

But wait, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. The data suggests that G2 is the transcription factor because
