Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe because Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

Wait, the problem is about relativistic energy, so I think I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations. Oh right, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

So first, I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need its mass. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass number A and the atomic number Z. For Li-6, Z is 3 (since Li has 3 protons) and A is 6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons). 

Wait, the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy, but maybe for this problem, they just want me to use the approximate mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass of Li-6. But wait, without exact numbers, maybe I can use the average mass of a nucleon. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Wait, but this might not be precise. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6 * 938.9 MeV/c² minus the binding energy. But wait, the exact value might be necessary here because the answer options are precise. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as m = A * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is the average mass of a proton or neutron. Wait, maybe the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me think.

Wait, the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.017 atomic mass units (u). I can convert that to GeV. Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV, so 6.017 u is 6.017 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, 0.017 * 931.5 is about 15.8355 MeV. So total is 5589 + 15.8355 = 5604.8355 MeV, which is 5.6048 GeV approximately.

Wait, but maybe the exact value isn't necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the rest mass is simply m = A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass, but wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. Hmm, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate the mass as 6 * 938 MeV/c², which is 5.628 GeV.

So the next step is to find gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The speed v is 0.96c. So let's compute beta = v/c = 0.96.

So beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So yes, sqrt is 0.28, so gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

So the total energy E is gamma * m c². But wait, m c² is the rest energy. So E = gamma * m * c². So if m is 5.6048 GeV/c², then E is 3.5714 * 5.6048 GeV.

Wait, let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.6048 ≈ ?

3.5714 * 5 is 17.857.
3.5714 * 0.6048 is approximately 2.1598.
So total is 17.857 + 2.1598 ≈ 20.0168 GeV.

Hmm, but wait, when I calculated the mass as 5.6048 GeV/c², that was based on 6.017 u. Let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 6.017 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.017 * 931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 is 5589, 0.017 *931.5=15.8355. So 5589 +15.8355=5604.8355 MeV =5.6048 GeV. So that's correct.

So E is gamma * m c² =3.5714 *5.6048 ≈ 20.0168 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, my calculation is approximately 20.0168 GeV, which is close to option C) 20.132 GeV, but a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck gamma. Let's compute it more accurately.

v = 0.96c, so beta =0.96.

beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - beta squared = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.6048 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6048.

Breaking it down:

5.6048 *3 =16.8144.

5.6048 *0.57142857 = ?

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, which is 0.57142857.

So 5.6048 * (4/7) = (5.6048 *4)/7 =22.4192 /7 ≈3.202742857.

So 16.8144 +3.202742857 =20.01714286 GeV.

So approximately 20.017 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but perhaps the rest mass I used was a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is more precise. Let me think: The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.017532 u. Wait, I think that's correct. So 6.017532 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.017532 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315

0.007532 *931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.007 *931.5=6.5205, 0.000532 *931.5≈0.5.

Wait, 0.007 *931.5=6.5205, 0.000532 *931.5≈0.5 (exactly, 0.532 *931.5 =498.498, but that's for 0.532, but wait I think I'm making a mistake here. Wait, 0.000532 is 5.32e-4. So 5.32e-4 *931.5 = approximately 0.5 (since 5.32e-4 *1e3 is 0.532, so 0.532 * 0.9315 ≈0.5).

So 0.007532 *931.5 ≈6.5205 +0.5=7.0205.

So total 0.017532 *931.5 ≈9.315 +7.0205=16.3355 MeV.

So total mass is 5589 +16.3355 =5605.3355 MeV, which is 5.6053 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6053 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6053.

Compute 5.6053 *3 =16.8159.

Then 5.6053 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 5.6053 *4 =22.4212.

Then divide by 7: 22.4212 /7 =3.20302857.

So total E=16.8159 +3.20302857 ≈20.0189 GeV.

So approximately 20.019 GeV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Wait, beta is 0.96, so 1 - beta squared is 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 -0.9216=0.0784. The square root is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

But perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate gamma. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the mass in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a calculator, to more decimal places.

Wait, sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, but maybe I made an error in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check another source or think differently.

Wait, another approach: The mass of the nucleus can be found using the formula:

M = (Z * m_p + (A-Z) * m_n) - binding energy.

But the binding energy is not exactly known, but perhaps for a rough estimate, the mass is approximately A * m_nucleon_avg. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass as m = A * m_p, but that's not correct since neutrons are slightly heavier than protons.

Wait, but in reality, for a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons, the mass is approximately (Z * m_p + N * m_n) - binding energy. But without knowing the exact binding energy, perhaps the problem expects an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass as A * m_n, where m_n is the neutron mass. Wait, the neutron mass is about 939.565 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So m =3*(938.272 MeV +939.565 MeV)/c²? Wait, no, that's not the way. Each proton is about 938 MeV, each neutron about 939.565 MeV. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m =3*(938.272 +939.565) /2? Wait, no, that's not correct. Each proton and neutron is counted separately.

Wait, the mass of the nucleus is sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But without exact figures, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of Li-6 as approximately 6 *938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I had 5.6053 GeV based on 6.017532 u. So perhaps the precise calculation uses that.

So let's proceed with that.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6053 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6053.

Breaking it down: 3 *5.6053=16.8159.

0.57142857 *5.6053: let's compute 5.6053 *0.57142857.

5.6053 *0.5 =2.80265.

5.6053 *0.07142857 ≈ 5.6053 * (1/14) ≈0.40038.

So adding those together: 2.80265 +0.40038≈3.20303.

So total E ≈16.8159 +3.20303=20.0189 GeV.

So approximately 20.019 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma or the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass is more precise. Let me recalculate the exact mass in GeV.

Given that the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.017532 u, and 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c².

So 6.017532 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6*931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.017532 *931.5 = let's compute this accurately.

0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.007532 *931.5 = 0.007 *931.5 =6.5205 MeV, plus 0.000532 *931.5.

0.000532 *931.5 = let's compute 532 *931.5 = 532 *931.5. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.000532 *931.5 = approx 0.532 *0.9315 ≈0.5.

Wait, 0.000532 *931.5 MeV = 0.532 *931.5 *1e-3 = (0.532 *931.5) *1e-3. 0.532 *931.5 = approx 500 MeV (since 0.5 *931.5=465.75, 0.032*931.5≈29.8, total≈495.55). So 495.55 MeV *1e-3 =0.49555 MeV.

So 0.007532 *931.5 ≈6.5205 +0.49555 =7.01605 MeV.

So total is 9.315 +7.01605 =16.33105 MeV.

So total mass is 5589 +16.33105 =5605.33105 MeV, which is 5.60533105 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.60533105.

Compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60533105.

Let me compute this using a more accurate method.

We can compute 3.57142857 *5.60533105 as:

(3 +0.57142857) * (5 +0.60533105)

=3*5 +3*0.60533105 +0.57142857*5 +0.57142857 *0.60533105

=15 +1.81599315 +2.85714285 +0.34559279.

Adding these together:

15 +1.81599315 =16.81599315.

16.81599315 +2.85714285=19.673136.

19.673136 +0.34559279=20.01872879 GeV.

So approximately 20.0187 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's off by about 0.11 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe the actual mass of Li-6 is higher than 5.605 GeV? Let me check a more precise value.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.0175322 u.

So 6.0175322 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6.0175322 *931.5:

Compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.0175322 *931.5 = let's compute this.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.0075322 *931.5.

Compute 0.007 *931.5=6.5205.

0.0005322 *931.5=0.5322 *931.5 *1e-3.

0.5322 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.5 *931.5=465.75, 0.0322 *931.5≈29.98.

So 465.75 +29.98=495.73. Multiply by 1e-3 gives 0.49573 MeV.

So 0.0005322 *931.5=0.49573 MeV.

So 0.0075322 *931.5 =6.5205 +0.49573=7.01623 MeV.

So 0.0175322 *931.5 =9.315 +7.01623=16.33123 MeV.

Total mass:5589 +16.33123=5605.33123 MeV=5.60533123 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60533123.

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5.60533123.

Another approach: 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60533123.

Wait, 0.60533123 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.00533123 *3.57142857≈0.01903.

So total 2.14285714 +0.01903≈2.16188.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.16188≈20.01902 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.019 GeV.

But the options don't have that exact value. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the mass of Li-6. Maybe the exact value is higher than 6.017532 u.

Wait, another source says that the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.0175322 u. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach. Is there another factor I'm missing?

Wait, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6, yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy in a different way. Oh wait, perhaps the nucleus is moving, so the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy, but perhaps the kinetic energy is being considered. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which is the total energy, not just the kinetic.

Wait, the options are all around 20 GeV, which makes sense because gamma is about 3.5 and the rest mass is about 5.6 GeV, so 3.5 *5.6 is around 19.6, which is close to 20.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's about 20.02 GeV. But none of the options is exactly that. The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

Hmm, option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of gamma is wrong, but I think that's correct. Let me verify sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so yes, gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this using more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using a calculator instead of approximating.

Compute 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the problem uses a more precise value for the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 5.6058 GeV instead of 5.6053 GeV. Let me check.

Wait, 6.017532 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.017532 *931.5 =?

Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.017532 *931.5=?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.007532 *931.5= ?

Let me compute 0.007532 *931.5.

Compute 931.5 *0.007 =6.5205.

931.5 *0.000532 = 931.5 *0.0005=0.46575, 931.5 *0.000032=0.029808.

So 0.46575 +0.029808=0.495558.

So 0.007532 *931.5 =6.5205 +0.495558=7.016058 MeV.

So 0.017532 *931.5=9.315 +7.016058=16.331058 MeV.

Total mass:5589 +16.331058=5605.331058 MeV=5.605331058 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.605331058.

Compute that precisely.

Let me compute 5.605331058 *3 =16.815993174.

5.605331058 *0.5714285714.

0.5714285714 is 4/7, so 5.605331058 *4=22.42132423.

22.42132423 /7 =3.203046319.

So adding to 16.815993174 +3.203046319=20.01903949 GeV.

So roughly 20.019 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.11 GeV higher. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass is in amu, and perhaps I should use a more precise value for 1 u in MeV/c². Oh, wait! 1 u is approximately 931.494 MeV/c², not 931.5.

Ah, that's it! I was using 931.5 MeV/u, but the precise value is 931.494 MeV/u. So let me recalculate the mass.

So 6.0175322 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.0175322 *931.494 = ?

Compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494 MeV.

0.0075322 *931.494= ?

Compute 0.007 *931.494=6.520458 MeV.

0.0005322 *931.494=0.5322 *931.494 *1e-3.

0.5322 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.5 *931.494=465.747.

0.0322 *931.494≈29.9999.

So total 465.747 +29.9999 ≈495.7469.

Multiply by 1e-3: 0.4957469 MeV.

So 0.0075322 *931.494=6.520458 +0.4957469≈7.016205 MeV.

So 0.0175322 *931.494=9.31494 +7.016205≈16.331145 MeV.

Total mass:5588.964 +16.331145=5605.295145 MeV=5.605295145 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.605295145.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.605295145.

Let me compute 5.605295145 *3 =16.815885435.

5.605295145 *0.5714285714= ?

0.5714285714 is 4/7, so 5.605295145 *4=22.42118058.

Divide by 7: 22.42118058 /7≈3.203025797.

So total E=16.815885435 +3.203025797≈20.01891123 GeV.

So approximately 20.0189 GeV.

Still, that's about 20.019 GeV, which is not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula with momentum, but I don't think so. The question is straightforward: the total energy is gamma * m c².

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of A and Z. Oh wait, X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that's Li-6. So A=6, Z=3. Correct.

Wait, another thought: The problem says the energy of the RHIC. RHIC collides heavy ions, so perhaps each beam has energy E, and the total energy in the center of mass is sqrt(2 * E1 * E2 * (1 + cos θ)), but in this case, assuming it's a head-on collision, so cos θ= -1, but if both ions have the same energy, then the total energy would be 2*E. Wait, but the question is about the energy of each ion, not the total.

Wait, the question says: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c.

So each nucleus is accelerated to 0.96c, so the energy per nucleus is what's being calculated.

So perhaps I'm correct in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use m = A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. Let me try that.

m_p is about 938.272 MeV/c².

So m =6 *938.272 MeV =5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

Then E= gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

Compute 5.629632 *3=16.888896.

5.629632 *0.57142857=?

Compute 5.629632 *4=22.518528.

Divide by 7: 22.518528/7≈3.21693257.

So total E=16.888896 +3.21693257≈20.10582857 GeV.

Ah, that's closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why would the problem use the proton mass instead of the actual nucleus mass? Because protons are lighter than neutrons, and the nucleus has more neutrons. Wait, in this case, the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the approach using m_p for all nucleons would be inaccurate, but perhaps the problem expects that approximation.

Using m_p as 938.272 MeV, m=6*938.272=5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.629632 =?

Compute 3.57142857 *5.629632.

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632.

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632≈0.40428.

So 2.814816 +0.40428=3.219096.

So total E=16.888896 +3.219096≈20.108 GeV.

That's about 20.108 GeV, which is closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, the problem might expect this approach. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact mass, but I'm not getting an exact match.

Wait, perhaps I should do the calculation with more precise numbers.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

Let me compute it step by step.

3.57142857 *5.629632.

Let me break it down:

5.629632 *3 =16.888896.

5.629632 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.629632 *0.5 =2.814816.

5.629632 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.629632 *0.07 =0.39407424.

5.629632 *0.00142857≈0.008038.

So 0.39407424 +0.008038≈0.402112.

So 2.814816 +0.402112=3.216928.

So total E=16.888896 +3.216928=20.105824 GeV.

Hmm, which is approximately 20.106 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the problem uses a different approach or more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 * m_p, which is 5.629632 GeV, and gamma is calculated more precisely.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

So precise.

So E=3.5714285714 *5.629632 = ?

Compute 3.5714285714 *5.629632.

Using calculator steps:

5.629632 *3 =16.888896.

5.629632 *0.5714285714 = let's compute this accurately.

0.5714285714 =4/7.

So 5.629632 *4 =22.518528.

22.518528 /7=3.216932571.

So total E=16.888896 +3.216932571=20.10582857 GeV.

So approximately 20.1058 GeV.

That's about 20.1058 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV, but not exactly matching. However, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed, like 0.98c or similar. No, the speed is given as 0.96c.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.026 GeV higher than my calculation. Maybe I should see if using a more precise value for the speed would change the result, but the speed is given as 0.96c, so that's fixed.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the nucleus as m = (Z * m_p + (A-Z)* m_n), where m_p is the proton mass and m_n is the neutron mass.

m_p=938.272 MeV, m_n=939.565 MeV.

So for Li-6: Z=3, A=6, so N=3.

m=3*938.272 +3*939.565 = (3*938.272)=2814.816 MeV, 3*939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total m=2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.633511=?

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.033511 *3.57142857≈0.1196.

So total ≈2.14285714 +0.1196≈2.26245.

So E≈17.85714285 +2.26245≈20.11959 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV. Which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmmm, perhaps the problem uses this approach, leading to option C as the answer.

Wait, 20.1196 is about 20.12 GeV, and the option is 20.132 GeV. Close enough, considering possible rounding during calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses more precise mass values, leading to the exact option.

In any case, the calculation seems to converge around 20.1 GeV, which would make option C the correct choice.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \), so \( \beta = v/c = 0.96 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of Li-6
The nucleus X is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.017532 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:

\[
m = 6.017532 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5605.331 \, \text{MeV} = 5.605331 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.605331 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857
\]
\[
3.5714 \times 0.605331 \approx 2.162
\]

Adding these together:

\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.162 = 20.019 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation with precise values
Using more precise values for \( \gamma \) and \( m \), the calculation yields:

\[
E \approx 3.5714 \times 5.605331 \approx 20.019 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This value is very close to the provided option \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \), suggesting that the problem may use slightly different approximations or rounding conventions.

### Step 5: Verify with alternative approaches
If the rest mass is approximated as \( 6 \times 938.272 \, \text{MeV} = 5.629632 \, \text{GeV} \), the total energy becomes:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.629632 \approx 20.1058 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This is even closer to \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \), supporting the selection of option C.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC, based on the given speed and approximations, is closest to **20.132 GeV**.
