Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. Then there's a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's, and they want the maximum orbital period for the second planet such that it will show both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits with the same orbital plane.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit its star, it needs to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter given is 0.2, which I think is the measure of how close the planet's path comes to the center of the star. A lower impact parameter means a closer approach.

Wait, the impact parameter (b) is defined as the distance of closest approach in units of the star's radius. So b = (d - R_s) / R_s, where d is the distance of closest approach from the star's center, but maybe I should think in terms of the formula for transit. Alternatively, the impact parameter is given by b = (a * sin i) / R_s, where a is the semi-major axis, assuming a circular orbit and i is the inclination. Since the orbit is edge-on (for transit), i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. So, b = a_p / R_s, where a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, but the star has radius R_s = 1.5 R_sun. The planet's radius is R_p = 1 R_earth, which is much smaller than the star. But for the transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star. The maximum orbital period for the second planet would be when both transits and occultations are possible.

Wait, occultation is when the planet passes behind the star as seen from Earth, right? So for both transits and occultations to occur, the second planet's orbit must be such that it can both pass in front and behind of the star relative to our line of sight.

But I think the key here is about orbital periods and the orbital periods of the two planets. Because they are
