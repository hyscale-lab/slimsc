Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for it, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, and now they're looking at the mutations in the target gene. The goal is to find which mutation will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene's sequence is given, and there are four mutants (1-4). I need to look at each mutant's sequence and see which one changes would likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the compound's production.

First, I remember that genes are made up of exons and introns. Exons are the coding regions, so changes there can affect the protein. Introns are non-coding, but their splicing is important. However, changes in exons are more likely to affect the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, the question says that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area. So the focus is on the first part of the gene, probably the start codon or early exons.

The anti-nutritional compound is presumably a protein, so if the gene's function is disrupted, the protein won't be made, and the compound will be eliminated.

I need to analyze each mutation for changes that cause a frameshift, a premature stop codon, or an alteration in the amino acid sequence that disrupts function.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTC becomes TCT ACG C? Wait, let me count.

Wait, let me write out the changes.

Let me break it down:

Intact first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, maybe the third codon is where the mutation is. Let me count the nucleotides.

Intact gene maybe: position 1-3: ATG (start), 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, etc.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC... So at position 7-9, instead of CTC, it's CTA? Or wait, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the changes occur in each mutant.

Mutant 1's sequence:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC ... Hmm
