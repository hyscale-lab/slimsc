Okay, so I have this question about barley and gene mutations. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the gene sequences. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, meaning probably disrupt the gene's function.

So, looking at the intact gene and the mutants, I need to spot which mutation would disrupt the gene. The anti-nutritional compound is likely due to the gene's product, so if the gene isn't working, the compound might not be made.

The gene sequences show changes in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation there could affect the protein. But I should check what kind of mutations each has.

Let me look at the sequences. The intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon) and then continues with various codons.

Mutant 1: 
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part, the first few bases after ATG are different. Let me compare to the intact gene.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …
Wait, I think I should write them aligned. Let me line them up.

Intact:  ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant1:  ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe I should look at the first few codons. So in the intact gene, the first few codons are TTT, CTC, GCT, etc. Let me see the differences.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at where the mutations are. The question says the mutations are
