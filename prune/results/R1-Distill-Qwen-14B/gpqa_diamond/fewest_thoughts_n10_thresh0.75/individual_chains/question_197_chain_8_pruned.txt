Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about Compound X, which has some IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different structure.

First, I should analyze the spectroscopic data to determine the structure of Compound X. Then, understand what reaction it undergoes when treated with red phosphorus and HI. Finally, determine the product structure based on that reaction.

Starting with the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1.

- The broad peak between 3400-2500 cm-1 is likely from an -OH group. But wait, another thought: sometimes a peak around 3000 cm-1 could be C-H stretching, but the broadness suggests it's an -OH (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid). But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is usually a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ (broad), and a strong C=O around 1700 cm⁻¹. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound is an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1750 cm⁻¹. So, the IR could be suggesting an ester or a possibly a ketone, but ketones are usually lower. Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid. Let me note that.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's probably an -OH proton. For a carboxylic acid, the proton is around 10-12 ppm and broad. So this supports the idea of a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. The doublet suggests coupling with one proton each. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring in the para positions.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, probably adjacent to substituents. Wait, but if the substituents are in para positions, maybe these are the ortho protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a group and something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think. If there's a substituent on the benzene ring, like a methyl or another group, the aromatic protons would split into certain patterns. Let me consider that.

Looking further down the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a methylene group adjacent to something, perhaps an oxygen or a carbonyl. Wait, but if it's an -OCH2CH2 group or something similar, but not sure yet.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H
