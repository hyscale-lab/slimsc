Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, which probably affects some constants, but I'm not sure yet.

The problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So these are the three dissociation steps for phosphoric acid.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are HPO4^3- or PO4^3-? Hmm. Wait, no, wait. Oh, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, the conjugate bases are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So I'm a bit confused about what the question is asking. Oh, wait, the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-? I think I'm mixing terms. Let me think: H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. Each deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (first), then HPO4^2- (second), then PO4^3- (third). So orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, maybe? Or perhaps it's referring to the general phosphate ion, but I need to figure this out.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. I think orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion because that's the second deprotonation. So the problem is asking for [HPO4^2-].

But wait, let's think about the salts we have. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K+ and H2PO4^- (since KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2
