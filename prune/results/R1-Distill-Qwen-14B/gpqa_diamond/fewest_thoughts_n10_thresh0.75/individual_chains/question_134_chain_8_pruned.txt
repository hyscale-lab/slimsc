Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is when an acid reacts with a base to form water and a salt, releasing heat usually. But wait, how do I approach this with the given concentrations and volumes? 

Let me read the problem again: It's mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I think the first step is to figure out how much acid and base is present because the reaction will depend on that.

So, I'll start by calculating moles for each solution. Moles are calculated by molarity (M) multiplied by volume in liters.

For HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, concentration 0.3 M. So moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. So each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. So the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each mole gives two OH- ions. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the reaction between acids and base. The H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base to form water. The total H+ is from both HCl and H2SO4. So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

The OH- is 0.2 moles. So which one is the limiting reactant? The H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- will run out first, meaning it's the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form water. The remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

Wait, but what about the other H+ from H2SO4 after the first dissociation? Wait no, because H2SO4 is a strong acid,
