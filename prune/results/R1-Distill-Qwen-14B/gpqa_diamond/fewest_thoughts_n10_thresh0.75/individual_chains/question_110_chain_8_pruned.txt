Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has their own limits on what they can observe. So, the question gives me the brightness limitsâ€”ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait! I think it's the opposite. No, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," and "brighter than 16 V mag with HIRES." Oh wait, no, because higher magnitudes are fainter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars that are up to mag 17, which is fainter than HIRES's limit of 16. So, the higher the mag, the dimmer the star. So, HIRES can only see brighter stars than ESPRESSO? Or wait, no: no, brightness is the other way around. Wait, no: the magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it's for stars with apparent magnitude less than 17. Because a magnitude of 17 is fainter than 16. So, HIRES can only observe stars with V mag less than 16, which is brighter than what ESPRESSO can handle (which is up to 17, so fainter). So both telescopes would need the star's apparent magnitude to be below their respective limits.

Wait, the question asks which stars can be detected with both instruments. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be bright enough (i.e., magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than 16 for HIRES). Because if a star is brighter than 17, say 15, both can detect it. But if it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be less than 16.

Wait, but wait: the question says "brighter than V mag 17" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, no, the problem says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, stars with V mag less than 17. Because when a star is brighter (lower mag), it's easier to observe. So, for ESPRESSO, mV < 17. For HIRES, mV <16. So for a star to be observed by both, its mV must be <16.

So, any star that has an apparent V mag less than 16 can be seen by both. But looking at the stars:

Star1: absolute magnitude is 15.5, at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude m = M + 5 +5 log d (but wait, the formula
