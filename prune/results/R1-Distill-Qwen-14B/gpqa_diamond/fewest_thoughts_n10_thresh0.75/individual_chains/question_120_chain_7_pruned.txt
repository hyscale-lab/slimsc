Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let me read it again. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each a different power of 1 over plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax in arcseconds (") is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. But how does that help with the number of stars?

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. So I guess that means the number density of stars in space is constant. Uniform distribution in the sky probably implies that more distant stars are spread out more, but same number per volume? Or is it about how they appear in the sky, like solid angle?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux or how many stars we observe in a certain range of parallax. Parallax is a measure of distance—so stars with small parallax are distant, and large parallax are closer.

The question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. Let's denote this as N(plx) dplx, the number of stars in a small range dplx around plx.

If the star distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per volume). But how does dV relate to parallax?

Parallax plx is 1/d, where d is distance. So as plx increases, d decreases. Let's think about the volume of space between distance d and d + dd. That's a spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd. The volume is 4π d² dd.

But wait, if we're considering a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx, then since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, the corresponding distance range would be from d = 1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, that's a bit tricky because d is a function of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of d. So, for a given distance d, the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dd is proportional to the surface area at distance d times the thickness, multiplied by the number density n.

Wait, since the distribution is uniform in the sky, I think that refers to uniform in space, so number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a shell would be n * 4π d² dd. But wait, I'm considering a thin shell, so yes.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range, not per distance. So I need to express the number of stars in terms of parallax. Let's let plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then, the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. But dd is related to dplx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx increases as d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (1/(plx²)) dplx, but with a negative sign
