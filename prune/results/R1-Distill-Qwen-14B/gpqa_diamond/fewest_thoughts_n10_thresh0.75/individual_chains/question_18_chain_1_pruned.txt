Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. They've used the Equivalent Width (EW) method under the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) assumption to determine their elemental abundances.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the photospheric composition for the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → which means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I think we need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2] or something like that. Wait, no, the ratio of silicon atoms, which probably means n_Si(Star1) / n_Si(Star2).

Hmm. So, I should probably compute the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, then take their ratio.

First, let's unpack the given abundance ratios. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_Sun = log10(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_Sun).

Wait, no, wait: the standard definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_☉. So, for example, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 means that the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because 0 means log10(...) equals the solar value.

Wait, let me think again. The definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) – log10(n_X/n_Y)_☉. So, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(n_Fe/n_H)_1 – log10(n_Fe/n_H)_☉ =
