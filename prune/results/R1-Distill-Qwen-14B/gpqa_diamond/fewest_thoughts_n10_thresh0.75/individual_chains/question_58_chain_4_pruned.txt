Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's like a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or something, then you take it away in the end. But wait, not all theories might need that.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory, right? And since it's a theory that's supposed to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, maybe it doesn't have the same kind of divergences that other QFTs do. Wait, but I'm not sure. Do string theories have issues with divergences? Or maybe they handle things differently because they're not just point particles but strings. I think superstring theory might not require regularization because the underlying framework could be more well-behaved, avoiding some of the divergences that other theories have. But I'm not entirely certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. And because of asymptotic freedom, it's a theory where the coupling becomes weak at high energies. But wait, do you need regularization for QCD? Well, any gauge theory in quantum field theory typically requires renormalization. And regularization is part of the renormalization process. So I think QCD does require regularization, maybe using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I remember that QED has processes like electron-positron pair production loops which can lead to divergences. These are handled with renormalization techniques, which in turn require regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization. For example, in calculating the electron self-energy, you get divergences that need to be handled with a regularization scheme, like cutoff regularization or using Pauli-Villars.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't have the same issues with infinities because they don't involve the same mathematical structures as quantum theories. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have loop corrections or virtual particles. So classical ED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the divergent integrals that QED or QCD deal with. It's all about solving differential equations without worrying about renormalization.

So putting it together, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. From the options, the only one that's classical is option D. QED and QCD are quantum theories needing renormalization, which includes regularization. Superstring theory, while a quantum theory, might not require regularization because of its stringy nature, but waitâ€”do string theories avoid the need for regularization? Or do they still require some form of it during calculations?

Wait, I think in string theory, especially superstring theory, the calculations often lead to different kinds of divergences, perhaps requiring different approaches. Or maybe because they're background-dependent, but I'm not entirely sure. But if the question is about which theory
