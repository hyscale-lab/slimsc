Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to these concepts. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about two compounds, A and B, reacting with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. The result is two different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B were from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain functional groups react with HCl, NaNO2, and water, they undergo specific transformations. Wait, sodium nitrite and HCl usually make me think of diazotization. Oh right, that's typically for aromatic amines. But wait, another possibility is that maybe these are used in the formation of carbonyl groups, perhaps through some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compounds A and B are alcohols that undergo oxidation or some kind of dehydration. But wait, the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, and water. I'm trying to recall the reactions. Oh wait! I think that when a geminal diol (like a diol where both hydroxyls are on the same carbon) reacts with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it can form a ketone. That's the Stephen reduction or something? Or maybe it's the Lossen-like rearrangement I'm thinking of. Alternatively, wait, that's more for amides. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait another angle: maybe this is the Beckmann rearrangement, but that's for oximes, which aren't directly mentioned here. Alternatively, what if the starting materials are alcohols that are adjacent to carbonyl groups? Oh wait, I think I remember that when a secondary alcohol is treated with HCl, it can form a chloro compound. But then with NaNO2 and H2O, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the products. The products are diketones. So, each of the products has two ketone groups. Let's look at the first product: 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. So that's a cyclohexane ring with two ketones at positions 1 and 2, and an isopropyl group at position 4.

The second product is 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. So a hexane chain with
