Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm going to think through each part carefully.

The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the combined products using HPLC. I remember that HPLC columns can be either normal-phase or chiral. Normal-phase columns separate based on polarity, and chiral columns separate based on the chirality of the compounds. So the number of peaks in each will depend on how many different compounds are present and if they are enantiomers or diastereomers.

First, let's look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. I think LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone, so after reduction, it should become a secondary alcohol.

Wait, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw that. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure would be (from left to right):

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CH3. But with 5-methoxy substitution. So carbon 5 has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons, with ketone on C3. So numbering from left to right: 1, 2, 3 (ketone), 4, 5, 6. So position 5 is the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

1: CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH2?

Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2
