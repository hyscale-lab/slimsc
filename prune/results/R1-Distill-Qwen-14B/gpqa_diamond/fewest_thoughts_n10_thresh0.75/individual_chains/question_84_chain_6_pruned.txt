Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one for solving higher-dimensional heat equations. Hmm, I remember that heat equations are partial differential equations, usually solved using finite difference methods. But how does that tie into matrix exponentials and parallel splitting?

Wait, the question mentions higher-order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. I think when solving PDEs with finite differences, you often end up with a system of linear equations that can be represented as a matrix. The solution over time involves matrix exponentials because the time evolution can be seen as the exponential of the matrix multiplied by time steps.

So when you want to make this process parallel, you probably need to split the matrix into smaller parts. Oh right, matrix splitting methods! Like in parallel computing, you divide the problem into subproblems that can be solved concurrently. For example, the idea behind the parallelization of algorithms like the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method or other splitting techniques.

But the key factor here is the conversion from sequential to parallel. The question says the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, I think, are techniques used to approximate matrix exponentials more efficiently. Maybe something like Pad√© approximants or Krylov methods?

Wait, the options are about the key factor. The question is asking which factor is crucial in converting the algorithm. The options are:

A) Stability analysis
B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions
C) Complex roots of fractional approximation
D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation

Stability analysis is important in numerical methods, but I don't think it's the key factor here for parallelism. Nonlocal boundary conditions are when the boundary depends on values inside the domain, but I'm not sure how that directly ties into making the algorithm parallel.

Fractional approximation methods... I remember that when approximating matrix exponentials, especially for large matrices, you might use methods that decompose the matrix into parts that can be handled in parallel. Like, if the approximation can be split into linear combinations of simpler matrices, each part can be computed independently.

Wait, linear partial fraction decomposition. Oh, right! When you have a function like e^{At}, you can sometimes decompose A into parts that can be exponentiated separately. If you can split the matrix into a sum of matrices whose exponentials can be computed and combined, you can compute them in parallel.

Looking at option D:
