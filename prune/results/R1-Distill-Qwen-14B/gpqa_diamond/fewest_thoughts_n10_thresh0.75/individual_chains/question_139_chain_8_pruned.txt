Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

First, I remember that when you treat certain compounds with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it usually leads to some kind of ring expansion or formation, especially in cyclic systems. Oh wait, that's the von Braun degradation maybe? Or perhaps it's related to the formation of ketones from other functional groups.

Wait, von Braun degradation is when a cyclic amide (lactam) reacts with HCl and NaNO2, leading to a ring expansion. Hmm, but the products here are diketones, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Another thought: what if the starting materials are cyclic ketones or something else that can undergo ring-opening or expansion upon treatment with these reagents?

Wait, I think I remember that when a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, is treated with acid, it can open. But that might not directly form a diketone.

Alternatively, I recall that the HCl, NaNO2, and H2O conditions are used in the production of nitrous acid, which can act as a source of a nitroxide ion. This is often involved in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: there's a reaction where a diol (with adjacent hydroxyl groups) under certain conditions can form a diketone. Oh! Maybe it's the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, Baeyer-Villiger involves ketones and introduces oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think of the pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol is a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) that, when treated with acid, undergoes dehydration to form a carbonyl compound. Wait, but that would form a single ketone or aldehyde, not a diketone. Wait, no, maybe if the diol is such that upon rearrangement, two ketones are formed.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals or something similar that upon treatment undergo cleavage to form ketones. Or maybe the
