Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that the mean decay length has something to do with the particle's lifetime and velocity.

Wait, right, the mean decay distance (L) is the product of the particle's velocity (v) and its lifetime (τ). So, L = v * τ. But how do I find τ from the given data?

I think the lifetime is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), and τ is the uncertainty in time (Δt). So, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I also remember that Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ/(Γ). Oh wait, actually, I think the exact relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units that I need to convert. Oh right, I should probably convert everything into compatible units.

Calculating τ: τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute this. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, but in terms of units, I need to make sure Γ is in GeV for the units to work.

Γ is 320 MeV. Oh, right, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait a minute, I think I got the formula wrong. Because the
