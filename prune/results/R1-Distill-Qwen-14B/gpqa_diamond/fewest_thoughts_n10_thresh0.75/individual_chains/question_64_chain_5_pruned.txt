Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weighs 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without any air. Then, a mixture of gases formed, and without cooling, they passed these gases through three tubes. 

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (number 1), then Ca(OH)2 solution (number 2), and then red-hot copper (number 3). The results are that the weight of tubes 1 and 3 increased by 3.60g and 0.80g respectively. Tube 2 didn't change in weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes. Let's break it down step by step.

First, heating the salts to 200°C without air. So, probably a decomposition reaction. The decomposition of some common salts when heated... maybe like nitrates decomposing into nitrites and oxygen, or carbonates decomposing into CO2 and something else.

The gases formed then pass through these tubes. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent but also can react with certain gases. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture, but also maybe reacts with acidic gases like HCl, HBr, etc. Because Mg(ClO4)2 + HCl → MgCl2 + 2HClO4, or something like that. So if the gases have H+ ions, like HCl, they would be absorbed here.

But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so maybe it's acting as a desiccant, but perhaps it's reacting with water vapor? Or maybe with other gases. Alternatively, if the gas is a strong acid, it would react.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. That's a base, so it can react with acidic gases. For example, CO2 would react to form CaCO3 and water. Or SO3 would react, but I don't think that's likely here. Also, NH3 would react, but that's a base. Wait, but when gas is passed through Ca(OH)2 solution, if the gas is acidic (like CO2), it would form a precipitate. If the solution's weight didn't change, that suggests no reaction occurred in tube 2. So the gas that went through tube 2 didn't react with Ca(OH)2, meaning it wasn't something like CO2 or H2S or something that would form a precipitate.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. So that's probably reacting with a gas that can reduce copper from its oxide. For example, H2 would react with CuO to form Cu and water. Or maybe CO, which would react with CuO to give CO2 and Cu. The increase in weight in tube 3 is 0.80g, which is from CuO being formed, but wait no, because the problem says CuO is formed. Wait, but if the gas is H2 or CO, it would reduce CuO, so the product would be Cu. But the weight increased, so perhaps the reaction is the reverse: maybe the gas is O2 or something else, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2O vapor? But red-hot copper wouldn't react with H2O. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the tube 3 is red-hot copper, so the gas probably is something like CO or H2, which would reduce copper oxides. But the weight increased by 0.80g. So in a reduction reaction, the metal oxide would gain mass. For example, in the reaction where CO reduces CuO:

CuO + CO → Cu + CO2.

Wait, but that's a reduction. The copper oxide is being reduced, so the mass of the copper would decrease because it's going from CuO (around 80g/mol) to Cu (64g/mol). So the mass would actually decrease if CO were reacting. But in this case, the mass increased, so maybe it's the opposite: something is oxidizing the copper, but that's unlikely because heating without air suggests maybe a decomposition
