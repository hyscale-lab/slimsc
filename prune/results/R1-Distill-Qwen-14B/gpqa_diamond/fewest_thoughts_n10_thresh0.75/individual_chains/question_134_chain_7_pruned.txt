Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The formula usually involves calculating moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting.

Wait, the question says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh right, each of these will contribute their own H+ or OH- ions. But wait, since it's enthalpy of neutralization, I need to find out how much acid and base are reacting because the neutralization depends on the moles of H+ and OH- available.

Let me write down the given data:

HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

First, I calculate the moles for each solution.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so I need to convert mL to liters.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl gives
