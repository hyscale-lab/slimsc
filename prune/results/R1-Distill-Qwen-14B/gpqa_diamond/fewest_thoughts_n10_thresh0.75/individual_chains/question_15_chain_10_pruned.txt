Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

Alright, the scenario is that researchers want to observe transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they need to choose the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the RV method gives us the minimum mass because it depends on the velocity along our line of sight, but for this question, both planets have the same mass. So that part might not matter directly. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Also, both have circular orbits. That's probably important because eccentricity affects the probability of transit; but since they're both zero, maybe that's not a factor here.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But wait, both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting because more massive stars are generally larger, but in this case, they are the same radius. So the host of Planet_1 is more massive but same size as Planet_2's host.

Now, I need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star's size, right? Or wait, the specific formula for transit probability.

I remember that the transit probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a)^2, but wait, no. Let me think again. The probability of a transit is the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit (as seen edge-on) to the size of the star. More precisely, the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) * (something else?), but wait, I think the formula is actually (R_*/ a) * (something else?).

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint) is approximately (R_*/ a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is (R_*/ a) * (something about the inclination), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, I think the actual formula for the probability of a transit is (R_*/ a) * (some factor based on the star's size relative to the orbit). Wait, perhaps the standard formula for the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (something else), but maybe it's (R_*/ a) * ... Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, I think the probability is actually proportional to (R_*/a) * (something else? Or maybe
