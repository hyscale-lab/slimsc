Okay, so I have this question about the transit method for detecting exoplanets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question is about choosing which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if the period is shorter, that means it's orbiting closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to the distance from the star.

Also, their host stars have the same radius. Interesting. The host of Planet_1 is more massive—twice as much as Planet_2's host. But same radius. How does that affect the probability?

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh, right, the formula for the probability P is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by some factor, but wait, no, that's the depth. The probability might be more about the orbital plane being edge-on. 

Wait, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_p / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to be in the right part of the sky for the transit—so the higher the a, the lower the chance of the planet's path crossing our line of sight. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around: lower a (closer orbit) means a higher chance of transiting because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The probability depends on the planet's orbital inclination. For a transit to happen, the inclination has to be close to 90 degrees. The probability is the fraction of all possible inclinations that would result in a transit. I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, but I might be mixing this up.

Wait no, the transit probability is given by (R_p / a)^2 times the square of some factor involving the star's radius? Or maybe another way. Let me think again. I remember that the probability formula is (R_s + R_p)^2 / (a^2 + R_s^2 +
