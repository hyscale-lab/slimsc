Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

So, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait—when they're moving in the same direction, how do I find the relative speed? I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' when one frame is moving at velocity u with respect to another is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, wait, no, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me get this straight. If object A is moving at u in the frame of object B, and B is moving at v relative to the rest frame, then A's speed relative to B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), right?

So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, the relative speed of B is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, let's compute that denominator. 0.5c * 0.6c is 0.3 c². So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

And the numerator is (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c. So u' is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857 c. Wait, but speed is positive, so the magnitude is 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c. But wait, the options have 0.14c as an option, so that's looking promising.

But wait, wait. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, and A is faster than B, then from A's frame, B is moving slower. So the relative speed would be positive if we're considering the direction.
