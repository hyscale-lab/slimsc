Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that at such speeds, you can't just use classical mechanics because of the effects of relativity. Right, so I'll have to think about relativistic velocity addition and relativistic energy.

The question says that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. And the problem is asking for the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Let me break this into two parts: relative velocity and total energy.

First, relative speed. Wait, in relativity, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, you can't just subtract their speeds normally. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, that's when u is the velocity of one object as seen from the other. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. If astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, then from A's frame, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - uv/c²). Wait, but wait, no, I might have to get that right. Let me think. The correct formula for the relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, u and v are measured in the same frame, right?

Wait, the formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v (same direction) from the rest frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, so that's (-0.1c) divided by (1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1428c. But speed can't be negative, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Wait, but the options have 0.14c as an option, like option C and D.

Wait, but wait, are we taking the absolute value? Because the relative speed is the magnitude. So the relative speed is 0.14c approximately. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that narrows down the choices.

Now the second part: total energy of the system. Hmm, I think the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) → approximately 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct E is about 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations because sometimes I make mistakes with the gamma factors.

Let me recalculate Gamma1: 0.6c: (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So 1 / 0.8 is indeed 1.25. So E1=1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

Gamma2: 0.
