Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to yield 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So, ketones have a carbonyl group, which is electrophilic, right? The cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, what about the conditions? 

Oh, right! The reaction of ketones with HCN typically gives a cyanohydrin. Now, I think that the addition of HCN to a ketone forms a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. But wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So perhaps it's a similar situation. But wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the reaction is under acidic conditions. Because I remember that sometimes you need an acid catalyst for such additions. Like, HCN is a weak acid, so maybe you need a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So perhaps the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+?

So, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and H3O+ (which is option A's choice for A), would form a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN, but the product has the OH and CN on the same carbon. So yes, that makes sense. So the first part probably uses H3O+ as the acid.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid
