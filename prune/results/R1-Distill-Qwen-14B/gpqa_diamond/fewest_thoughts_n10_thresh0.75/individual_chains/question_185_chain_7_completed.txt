Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues are the possible energy levels.

The given Hamiltonian is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices vector, right? And n is a unit vector. So H = ε σ · n. 

I think σ · n would involve the sum of each Pauli matrix component multiplied by the corresponding n component. Like σ·n = σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. But for eigenvalues, I might not need to get into the components. 

Wait, Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each of them has eigenvalues. For example, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, same for σ_y and σ_z. But when you take a linear combination like aσ_x + bσ_y + cσ_z, what's the eigenvalue? Oh right, because any Pauli matrix squared is identity, and their products have certain properties.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since σ · n is a vector in the direction of n, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1, because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and σ · n is just a combination scaled by the direction of n. But wait, I think the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because for any unit vector n, the operator σ ·n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because when you diagonalize it, the eigenvalues are the magnitude in the direction of n, but since it's a spin-1/2 system, the maximum is 1 and minimum is -1.

So the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by σ ·n. So that would scale the eigenvalues by ε. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), which is plus ε and minus ε.

Looking at the options, option B says plus epsilon and minus epsilon. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're 2x2 matrices with entries like 1,0, etc. Oh wait, no, in the context of spin, they are multiplied by factors that have dimensions. Wait, the Hamiltonian H has dimensions of energy. So epsilon must have dimensions of energy, as given in the problem statement. So when H is epsilon times sigma·n, and since sigma·n is dimensionless, the eigenvalues would just be ±epsilon.

So yeah, the eigenvalues are ±epsilon, so option B is correct.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), as this operator represents the spin component in the direction of \(\vec{n}\), and the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). 

Since \(H\) is \(\varepsilon\) times \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are scaled by \(\varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\). 

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \(+1, -1\) — Incorrect, as these are the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), not \(H\).  
**B)** \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) — Correct, as these are the eigenvalues of \(H\).  
**C)** \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) — Incorrect, as there is no factor of \(\hbar/2\) in the eigenvalues of \(H\).  
**D)** \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) — Incorrect, as these are unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.  

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
