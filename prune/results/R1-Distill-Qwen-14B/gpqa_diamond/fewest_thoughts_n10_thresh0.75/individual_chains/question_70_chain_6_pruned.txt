Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and see what's going on.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and we need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, Dâˆžh, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups relate to the arrangement of molecules, so identifying E's structure is key.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 1:8. I'm trying to think of a reaction where a solid and a gas produce a red product. Maybe something like copper reacting with sulfur? Wait, but sulfur is a solid too. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving transition metals. For example, maybe A is Fe (iron) and B is S (sulfur), producing FeS, but that's not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a metal reacts in a high oxidation state, maybe the product has a different color. Oh, wait! I've read that when copper reacts with sulfur, it forms Cu2S, which is black, but maybe in another reaction, perhaps something like a metal reacting with chlorine? Or maybe a reaction involving a metal and oxygen. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is something else. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me move to the next reaction.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, the molar ratio is 1:2 here. What gases could react with a compound C to form a hazardous product? Maybe gas D is chlorine (Cl2), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, D could be a halogen. The product E being hazardous suggests maybe something like a nerve agent, but perhaps more likely, it's something like a toxic gas or a strong acid.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. The fact that F is strong and G is weak suggests that the hydrolysis breaks C into ions of strong acid and something else.
