Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Hmm. So the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, which means the curve is perfect, right? The slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. Oh, right, the formula is efficiency = 10^(-1/slope). So with a slope of -3.3, the efficiency would be 10^(1/3.3), which is approximately 10^0.303. Let me calculate that. 10^0.3 is about 2, since 10^0.3010 is 2. So the efficiency is 99.9% maybe, close to 100%, which matches the 100% efficiency stated.

So looking at the results, the CTs for each dilution are in triplicates. For 100,000 copies, the CTs are around 34. For 10,000, they're around 31. Then 27 for 1000, 24 for 100, and 20.7 for 10 copies. Wait, each time the concentration is diluted 10-fold (since each step is 10x less). So if efficiency is 100%, each dilution should lead to an increase of 1 cycle in CT per 10-fold dilution. Because with 100% efficiency, each cycle doubles the product, so a 10-fold dilution would require 3.32 cycles (since 2^3.32 ≈10). But wait, the slope is -3.3, so the calculation is correct.

Wait, let me think about how the CT relates to concentration. The formula is CT = K - (log E / log 2) * log (N), where E is efficiency and N is the initial quantity. Or another way, the change in CT is inversely related to the change in quantity.

In a perfect scenario, a 10-fold dilution should result in an increase of 3.32 cycles (since each cycle doubles, so 2^3.32 ≈ 10). So from 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10-fold decrease. So the CT should go up by about 3.32. Let's check the data.

At 100,000 copies: average CT is (33.9+34.2+34.5)/3 ≈ 34.2. At 10,000: (30.6+30.9+31.2)/3 = 30.9. The difference is about 3.3, which is exactly what
