Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is about figuring out how different genes interact based on their knockout mutants and their resistance to anthracnose. Hmm, let me break this down.

So, the setup is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, were identified as candidates for anthracnose resistance. They made knockout mutants for each and also double mutants. Each mutant's resistance was tested. The results are given as percentages of the control (which is 100% resistant). 

Looking at the results:
- g1: 75% resistance. So less than control, but not super bad.
- g2: 0% resistance. So the mutant is super susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance. Half the control's resistance.
Double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% resistance. Very low.
- g2g3: 0%.
- g1g2: 0%.

The question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, one of them is a TF, and maybe the others are downstream.

We need to figure out the relationship between these genes. The options are A, B, C, D, each suggesting different interactions.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of A masks the effect of B. Like, if A is non-functional, B's function doesn't matter because it's downstream.

So, looking at the data, the g2 single mutant has 0% resistance. That's really bad. So gene G2 is really important for resistance. Also, any double mutant that includes g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also has 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is perhaps epistatic over the other genes. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other gene's function doesn't matter anymore.

Wait, but let me think. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking it out would prevent downstream genes from being expressed. So g2 has 0% resistanceâ€”maybe because without G2, the downstream genes aren't active, so the plant can't resist the fungus.

Now, looking at the single mutants:
g1: 75%,
g3:50%.

Wait, but when you look at the double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance. So lower than either g1 or g3 alone. Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 might function in the same pathway. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. That could mean that in the single mutants, each is partially functional, but when both are gone, there's no backup. Or perhaps they function in parallel pathways? Wait, no, because in g1g3, the resistance is lower than either, so maybe they contribute additively. Or maybe they are in the same pathway, and each contributes a part.

But let's think about epistasis. If Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, then the phenotype of A masks B. So, in a double mutant, you see the A phenotype if A is epistatic.

Looking at G2 again. Any double mutant with G2 knocked out (g1g2, g2g3) shows 0% resistance. So the presence of G2 is essential for any resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. That would mean G2 is upstream of the other two. Because if G2 is non-functional, then the other genes' products can't contribute anything. So G2 is a transcription factor upstream.

Now, looking at the double mutants without G2, you're left with g1g3. That has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. Let's compare that to the single mutants: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So both contribute, perhaps, but when both are gone, it's even worse.

Wait, but if G2 is the upstream TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. So the resistance in the single mutants (g1 and g3) must be due to other genes. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they might have some redundancy or work in parallel pathways.

Wait, the question says that at least one is a TF upstream of others. So possibly G2 is that TF.

So, if G2 is the TF, then when you have g2 (knockout), you get 0% resistance because all downstream genes (including G1 and G3
