Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Hmm, meta means each is separated by one carbon, so they should be in positions that are 1,3,5 relative to each other on the benzene ring. Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so when substituents are meta, they're two positions apart. Like, if one is at position 1, the next meta is at 3, and then 5.

But wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. So they form a sort of trio where each is meta to the others. So they would be at positions 1,3,5. Or maybe another set, but benzene is symmetric so it doesn't matter where you start.

Next, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. Oh, so the carboxylic acid is at a certain position, and the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino are adjacent to it. So if the carboxylic acid is in position A, the OH and the NMe₂ (dimethylamino) are in positions A+1 and A-1, or something like that. Wait, but in benzene, each substituent can have up to two ortho positions.

But the question says "ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino." So two substituents adjacent to the carboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is in one position, and the OH and NMe₂ are next to it. So in a benzene ring, if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the ortho positions would be 2 and 6. So perhaps the OH is at 2 and the NMe₂ at 6, or vice versa.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Wait, para is opposite, so for position 1, para is
