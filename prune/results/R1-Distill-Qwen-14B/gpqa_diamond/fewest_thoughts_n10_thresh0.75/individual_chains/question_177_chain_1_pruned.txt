Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's take it step by step.

The question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. Both are 1.5 times larger than Star_2. The spectroscopy part says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the brightness maximum wavelength, that's probably the peak emission wavelength. So for a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because the constant b is the same for both. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving much, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, wait, but radial velocity affects the Doppler shift, right? If a star is moving towards or away from us, it shifts the wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Wait, but if their temperatures are the same, and the wavelengths are the same—so does that mean that their Doppler shifts are somehow considered here? Or maybe the radial velocities don't directly affect the luminosity calculation since the problem states to assume they radiate as black bodies. Hmm, maybe the radial velocities are a red herring here.

Wait, the question is about the luminosity. So I need to compute the luminosity of each star and find the ratio. Luminosity for a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same T (from the peak wavelength), and R1 is 1.5 R2, I can compute L1 and L2.

So L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T^4
L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T^4

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² / R2
