Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. The stars, Star_1 and Star_2, have some given properties.

First, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, but I'm not sure how the mass plays into this yet. The problem is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature.

Then, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember from Wien's Law that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So, lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is same, T1 = T2. That's a key point.

Wait, but wait—the problem says they computed the luminosity using the blackbody radiation formula. So we'll probably need the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Luminosity L is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since σ and 4π are constants, we can focus on R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, do we have the temperatures? No, but we do know that the peak wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2. So T is the same for both. So the L of each star depends only on R² multiplied by T⁴, but since T is same, it's proportional to R². So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Since R1 is 1.5 R2, R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would point to option A, which is ~2.25. But wait, the options also have 2.32, 2.35
