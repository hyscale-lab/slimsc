Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic mechanics. But let's not panic. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium normally has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = mass number 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So, I need to calculate the energy required to accelerate this nucleus to 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. It's more complicated because of the gamma factor.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma. Let me jot that down.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate the square root of 0.0784. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait, let me verify that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0 * c². But I need to calculate m0 first—the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, I think the exact numbers might be a bit different. Let me recall: the proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is around 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, m0 = (3 * m_p) + (3 * m_n). Let's compute that.

3 * m_p = 3 * 938.272 ≈ 2814.816 MeV.
3 * m_n = 3 * 939.565 ≈ 2818.695 MeV.
Adding them together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. Wait, that's in MeV. But wait, no—wait. Wait a minute. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh wait, but wait, am I supposed to use the actual nuclear mass or the sum of individual nucleons?

Hmm, the problem states that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So I think it's Li-6, but the problem here is whether to use the
