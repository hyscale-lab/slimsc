Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what nucleus X is. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium. The standard Lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, maybe that's a different isotope? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no—Li-6 has 3 neutrons, right? Because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So nucleus X is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6 for this nucleus.

So the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The problem is about calculating the total energy of the ion in the collider. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. 

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, v = 0.96c. Let me compute gamma first.

Let me plug in the numbers. So v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is, let me calculate: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Wait, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Let me compute that exactly. 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 which is approximately 3.5714286.

So gamma is about 3.57143.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. So the atomic mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but wait, actually, the mass of a nucleus is a bit less than A times the mass of a proton because of binding energy. Oh wait, but for the purpose of calculating the rest mass energy, I think we can approximate it using the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². But for a nucleus, like Li-6, I think the mass is roughly the sum of the protons and neutrons, but considering their binding. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the atomic mass in atomic mass units (u) and then convert to energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass of each nucleon
