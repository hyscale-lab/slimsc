Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, it's all about breaking and reforming double bonds. The catalyst usually causes the alkene to undergo ring-closing metathesis if possible, or maybe some other rearrangement.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But in this case, since the molecule is a double bond, maybe the configuration around the double bond is what's important here. Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the pent chain has five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. Alternatively, maybe I got the substituents wrong. Let me count the carbons.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent means five carbons. So pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Oh, wait, no. Wait, no, pent is five carbons in a row. So pent-1-ene
