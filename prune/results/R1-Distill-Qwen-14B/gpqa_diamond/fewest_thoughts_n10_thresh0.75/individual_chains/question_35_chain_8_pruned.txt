Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, the options are about which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and see which option aligns with that.

First, let's write out the matrix Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and c = h/(4π), let me compute that. So each element of S is multiplied by c.

Matrix S is:
Row 1: [0, -i]
Row 2: [i, 0]

So Ay would be:
Row 1: [0, -i * c]
Row 2: [i * c, 0]

Substituting c = h/(4π), Ay becomes:
Row 1: 0, (-i) * (h/(4π))
Row 2: (i) * (h/(4π)), 0

So the matrix looks like:
[0, (-i h)/(4π)]
[(i h)/(4π), 0]

Hmm. Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[-a, (-i h)/(4π)]
[(i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

So determinant = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the product term. (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant = a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, wait. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So these are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are purely real. That's interesting because sometimes angular momentum components can have complex eigenvalues, but in this case, since we're dealing with a Hermitian operator, I think they should be real. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, S is a matrix. Let me check if S is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of S would swap the off-diagonal elements and take their complex conjugates.

S is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Conjugate transpose S
