Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix.

Hmm, first, let me recall what I know about angular momentum operators. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. For spin-½ particles like the muon, the spin matrices are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, but wait, here the problem presents S as a 2x2 matrix with specific entries.

The given matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Let me write that down:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, wait a second. The standard Pauli matrices usually have different forms. Oh wait, no. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So that's exactly what S is. So S here is the Pauli Y matrix, σ_y.

So A_y = c * σ_y, where c = h/(4π).

So the operator A_y is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

Let me compute that.

First, write out A_y. Since S is σ_y, A_y is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So A_y = [[0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation:

det( Ay - λ I ) = 0

Which is:

| -λ      (-i h)/(4π)       |
| (i h)/(4π)   -λ        |  = 0

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]] is ad - bc.

So:

(-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = 0

Compute each part:

( λ^2 ) - [ ( (-i)(i) * h^2 ) / (16 π^2) ) ] = 0

Simplify the second term:

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the second term becomes (1 * h^2) / (16 π^2) ) = h²/(16 π²)

So the equation is:

λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0

So λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots:

λ = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, so the eigenvalues are h/(4 π) and -h/(4 π). So their real parts are h/(4 π) and -h/(4 π), and the imaginary parts are zero. Wait, but that can't be right. Because the eigenvalues are real? Or are they?

Wait, wait. The matrix Ay is Hermitian? Because S (σ_y) is Hermitian, and c is a real scalar, so A_y is Hermitian. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so any real multiple of them is also Hermitian.

Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, so that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π) * 1.

Wait, that's for the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So their real parts are ± h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So looking at the options, the options A and B talk about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts.

Wait, options A and B are about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts. But according to this, the eigenvalues are real. So options A and B can't be correct because their statements include non-zero imaginary parts.

So A says imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, h/(4π) is approximately the unit of ħ/2, but we're using h,
