Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. So, I think the molecule has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a carbonyl group (because of the "carbaldehyde" part), so that's a CHO group. Then, there's a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, so the cyclohexane has a substituent that's a methyl group connected to both a hydroxyl (OH) and another cyclohexane ring?

Wait, maybe I should break this down. So the molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group attached. Then, on the same carbon as the aldehyde (or maybe another carbon?), there's a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a methylene (-CH2-) group, which also has a hydroxyl group. So the structure is something like:

The cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached to it, which is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. And there's also an aldehyde group somewhere. Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is on the same carbon as the CH2 group. Or maybe not. Hmm, maybe the main structure is a cyclohexane ring, with a side chain that is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), and the aldehyde is at the same carbon as the CH2 group.

Wait, the IUPAC name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be a cyclohexane with a -CHO group. The substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So the position is on the same carbon as the aldehyde?

Wait, position 1 probably refers to the same carbon as the
