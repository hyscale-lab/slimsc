Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Let me start by analyzing the IR.

The IR shows strong peaks in the regions 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, but since this is a carbonyl-containing compound perhaps, maybe it's an acid or an ester. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be either an ester, ketone, aldehyde, acid, or maybe an amide. But looking at the other peaks, there's 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now, the NMR data. Let me look at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. A proton at that shift is probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. A broad peak would suggest exchange with water, but wait, sometimes it could be an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm but as a triplet or something. Alternatively, if it's an acidic proton like -COOH, that makes sense. But wait, the integration is 1H. So there's only one such proton.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is present here. The 1720 cm-1 might be the C=O of the acid. So that's a possibility.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. That suggests para-substituted aromatic protons because the coupling is between two protons. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but wait—if there are two doublets, each with 2H, that would make sense for a substituent in the para position. Let me think: For example, if the ring has two substituents, one at position 1 and another at position 4 (para), then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be a doublet, and those in 3 and 5 would be another doublet. So the NMR shows 8.0 ppm for one set (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm for another (d, 2H). So the ring is probably para-substituted with two groups. But wait, the substituents would affect the chemical shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a monosubstituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, but the two doublets of 2H each suggest more than one substituent. Hmm. Or maybe it's a disubstituted benzene but in the para positions.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. So, considering the IR and NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is the carboxylic acid proton. Then, the benzene ring would have substituents. Let's see: in benzoic acid, the substituents are the COOH group and perhaps another group, like an alkyl chain.

Looking at the NMR, after the aromatic protons, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's around where an allylic proton or a geminal di-substituted group might appear. Wait, perhaps it's a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Or maybe it's a secondary alcohol, but in that case, the peak
