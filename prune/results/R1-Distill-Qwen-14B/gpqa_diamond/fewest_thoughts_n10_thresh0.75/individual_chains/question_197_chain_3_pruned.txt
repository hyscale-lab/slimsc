Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters, but wait, wait—no, wait a second. Oh right! That's for the hydrolysis of nitriles, or maybe the reaction is for something else. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of an alkyl chloride to an alcohol. But wait, another thought—maybe it's for the hydrolysis of esters? Or maybe it's for eliminating a group. Hmm, perhaps I should first figure out what the starting compound X is, based on the spectral data.

Looking at the IR data: the strong peak around 3400-2500 cm-1 suggests either an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or an N-H stretch, but more likely O-H because of the other peaks. There's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak, which might fit the 3400–2500 region. But wait, 1720 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid carbonyl, which is usually higher, like around 1700 or a bit higher. Wait, no, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with some conjugated carbonyl group. Let me think.

The NMR data: 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (1H). That's very downfield. That's probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid proton. Because in aromatic protons, you usually don't go that high. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or something. But the broadness suggests it's not an aldehyde but maybe a carboxylic acid. So that would mean the compound has a -COOH group.

Wait, but let's check the rest. The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, doublet (2H). Then 7.2 ppm, another doublet (2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So perhaps a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The two doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe a substituent in the para position, like a methyl group or something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm, multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm, multiplet (2H), 1.4 ppm, doublet (3H), and 0.9 ppm, triplet (3H). Hmm, that looks like a chain attached to the ring. Let's piece this together.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be part of a CH2-CH2 or CH2-CH structure. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is probably a methyl group attached to something—maybe a CH(CH3) group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2-CH3, like an ethyl group at the end of a chain.

Wait, putting it all together. The aromatic ring has substituents in para positions. Let's say one substituent is a -COOH group (from the IR and the NMR 10.5 ppm peak) and the other is an ethyl group or perhaps a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and an alkyl chain.

Wait, but the integration: 1H
