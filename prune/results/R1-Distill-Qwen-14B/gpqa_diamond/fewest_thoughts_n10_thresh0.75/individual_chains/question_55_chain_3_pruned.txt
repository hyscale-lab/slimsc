Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me an unknown organic compound's 1H NMR data and asks to identify it among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

First, I'll look at the NMR data provided.

The data is:
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (I think that's what 'dq' stands for)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the number of peaks and their splitting can tell us about the structure. Let me break this down.

Starting with the singlet at 2.1 ppm. A singlet means no neighboring protons. Three hydrogens—so maybe a methyl group attached to something that doesn't have adjacent hydrogens. Common groups are methyl esters, like in acetates. So perhaps this is the methyl from the acetate group (OAc).

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. A doublet means two peaks, so two neighboring protons. Three hydrogens—so maybe a CH2 group? Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait. If a CH2 is adjacent, perhaps it's a CH3 group attached to a CH that's connected to another CH2 or something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe this is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is next to another group. For example, in an allylic position or something. Or perhaps it's a propenyl group.

The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (dq). That's a bit tricky. Let me think. A doublet of quadruplets implies that the proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. Maybe a vinyl proton (like on a double bond) that's next to another group. For example, in a propenyl group, the middle proton would be split by the adjacent protons on either side.

Then there's the 7.0 ppm doublet with J = 16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which is typical for protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. Like in an E (trans) or Z (cis) configuration. Wait, the J value is around 16 Hz, which is typical for a trans double bond. Because for double bonds, the coupling between the two protons (like in a double bond) is usually trans around 16 Hz, and cis could be lower, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's a long-range coupling, like in an allylic system.

Wait, perhaps it's a trisubstituted double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring, but the integration is only 1H, so maybe not a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of an ester group.

Let me think about the possible structures.

The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates, cis and trans. So these are all esters where the propenyl or butenyl group is attached to the oxygen of the acetate.

So, for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but that's trans if the groups are on opposite sides). Wait, no, wait: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2OAc with a double bond?

Wait, let me clarify.

Propenyl groups can be either cis or trans. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CH2CH2-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? Or wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So propenyl groups are either CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but that would be 1-propenyl or 2-propen
