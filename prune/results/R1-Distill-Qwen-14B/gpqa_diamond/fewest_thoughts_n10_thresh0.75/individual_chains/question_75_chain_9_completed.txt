Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. The setup is a bit detailed, but let's break it down step by step.

First, the researcher created a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. They introduced a coding sequence that includes a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. They're checking for antibiotic resistance and testing the expression. But the protein isn’t overexpressing as expected.

The problem is in the construct's sequence. The plus strand reads a long sequence starting with ATG and ending with TGA. Wait, I remember that ATG is the start codon, and TGA is a stop codon. So maybe there's a stop codon in the middle somewhere?

Looking at the sequence, let me scan for TGA. Let's see... The sequence starts with ATG, then some other codons. Let me go through it. Hmm, towards the end, I see ... AGCTGA ... Oh wait, that's AGC followed by TGA. So the TGA is at the end, but wait, the sequence provided is the coding (plus) strand. So, the mRNA would be complementary to this. So the mRNA would have UAC as the first codon, then the rest. The construct's coding sequence ends with TGA on the plus strand, which in mRNA would be UAC... wait, no. No, wait. Wait, the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T becomes U. So if the construct's coding sequence ends with TGA, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but wait—the construct is designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus. If the coding sequence ends with TGA, that's a stop codon. So maybe the issue is that the construct has an early stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated or not made at all.

Looking at the sequence, the very end is ...GAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. So the last part is GAG TGA. The TGA is the stop codon. But wait, is this at the end of the entire construct, meaning that the gene ends with TGA, which would be the stop signal?

Wait, but the GADD45G coding sequence is supposed to include the HA tag. If the construct is correctly made, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. But if in the construct, there's a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated, leading to no functional protein. But the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening.

Wait, looking at the sequence again, perhaps the TGA is in the middle of the sequence. Let me see. Let me count the letters. Oh wait, the entire sequence is the coding strand, which is the same as the mRNA except Ts instead of Us. So the coding sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. But wait, how long is this sequence? Let me count the nucleotides. Each codon is 3 nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps that's the issue—the construct includes a stop codon at the end, but perhaps the vector's selection markers or other elements are interfering. Or perhaps the sequence is correct, but there's a problem in the cloning.

Wait, but the researcher intended to add the HA tag to the N-terminus. So the HA coding sequence should be followed by GADD45G's coding. So if the entire construct ends with TGA, that would mean the protein is correctly terminated. But why isn't the protein being expressed?

Looking at the options, option B is about the ribosome terminating early. How? If the mRNA has a stop codon upstream, that would cause early termination. But if the construct is correct, the stop codon is at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a stop codon in the middle due to a mutation. Wait, the question says that the researcher introduced the HA sequence. So perhaps they made a mistake in the HA coding sequence. Let me think about that.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acids, but if the HA is at the N-terminus, a mutation would affect the tag but not necessarily cause the protein not to be expressed. Unless it's a premature stop codon in HA. But the construct's entire coding sequence ends with TGA, which would be the end of the HA followed by GADD45G? Or is the HA followed by GADD45G?

Wait a minute, maybe the HA is at the beginning, but the way the construct is set up, maybe the HA's coding sequence is followed by the GADD45G. So the entire coding sequence would be HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA has a stop codon, then the protein would be truncated. Let me look at the plus strand again.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCAT, which is proline. Wait, the HA tag is from the influenza hemagglutinin. The HA tag is usually a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYA, but the coding sequence would be the DNA sequence for that.

Wait, in the construct, the HA is at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence should start with the HA coding, then followed by GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the start is ATG, which is methionine. Then TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), etc. So the HA coding is part of this sequence.

If the HA coding has a mutation, perhaps introducing a stop codon, then the protein would be truncated. But in the given sequence, the last codon is TGA, so perhaps that's the intended stop codon for the entire construct. But wait, the question states that the construct is designed to have the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding.

Wait, perhaps the HA is part of the coding sequence, and the GADD45G follows. So the entire construct's coding sequence is HA then GADD45G, ending with TGA as the stop codon. So the problem isn't in the HA; it's in the GADD45G.

Wait, but the issue is that the protein isn't being expressed. So why? Let's think about the options.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon. The plus strand has TGA as stop. So the mRNA would have UAC... no, wait, the coding strand is plus, so mRNA is complementary. Wait, coding strand is same as mRNA except T→U. So the plus strand has ATG... and ends with TGA. So mRNA would start with AUG and end with UAC... wait, no, the mRNA would have the same as the coding strand except T→U.

Wait, no, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA, but with T instead of U. So the plus strand has TGA at the end, so mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So in the mouse, during translation, the ribosome would encounter UGA and stop. But wait, in mammalian cells, UGA is a stop codon, translated with the help of release factors. So why would that be a problem?

Wait, but if the construct has a stop codon before the actual end, the protein would be truncated. But the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed at all. If the HA is correctly before GADD45G, but there's a stop codon in the HA, then the protein would be short. But the construct's stop is at the end.

Wait, another possibility: the construct might have been cloned in the wrong orientation. But the question says that the plus strand is the coding sequence, so the plasmid is correct.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. So, if the HA tag is followed directly by GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the proteases are cleaving the protein. But that would affect the protein after expression, not prevent its expression. The researcher is trying to affinity-purify the protein, so if it's being cleaved, perhaps they wouldn't detect it. But the problem here is that the protein isn't overexpressed, so maybe it's not being made.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. So perhaps there's an upstream stop codon in the construct. Looking at the sequence, perhaps the HA coding has an early stop codon.

Wait, the given construct sequence is the plus strand. So the coding is from 5' to 3'. Let me look if there are any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons in the middle.

Let me scan the sequence for TGA, TAG, or TAA. The sequence starts with ATG (start), then TAC, then CCAT, etc. Let me go through each triplet.

First 3: ATG (start)
Next: TAC (tyrosine)
Next: CCG (proline)
Wait, wait, no. Let me split into codons.

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTT GGA AGA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG TGG CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTG CAC GCT GCC GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG CAT CGT GGG CGC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCG CGG GCG GAC CTG CAG CAG GGT GCT CTT TCG CAG GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA CGA CTG GGT GCT CAG CAT CAC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, let me make triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTT GGA AGA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG TGG CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTG CAC GCT GCC GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG CAT CGT GGG CGC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCG CGG GCG GAC CTG CAG CAG GGT GCT CTT TCG CAG GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA CGA CTG GGT GCT CAG CAT CAC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Looking for stop codons in the middle. Let's see:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA. The first is at the very end: GAG TGA. So TGA is the last codon. So no other TGA in the middle. What about TAG or TAA? Let's see:

Looking for TAG: anywhere?

Looking at each codon:

ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, ACT, CTT, GGA, AGA, GTC, GCG, GCC, AGG, ACA, CAG, TTA, CGG, AAA, GCA, CAG, CCA, GGT, GCA, GGG, TGG, CGG, GAA, AGC, GCT, GCA, GAG, TTC, GCT, GCT, GTC, GGC, GCC, AGC, GTC, AGG, GCT, GCG, CTG, CAC, GCT, GCC, GGT, GAG, GAG, GAC, GAG, GGC, GAC, ATC, GCG, CTG, CAG, ATC, CAA, GCT, TCT, GCT, GCG, AGA, ACG, ACT, CGA, CAT, AGT, GCG, CGT, GGC, GAT, GTG, CAG, CGG, CTG, GCG, GCG, CAT, CGT, GGG, CGC, CGG, CGA, GAG, GCG, GGG, TGC, GCG, CGG, GCG, GAC, CTG, CAG, CAG, GGT, GCT, CTT, TCG, CAG, GAG, GAG, AGC, GCA, GCG, TTA, CGA, CTG, GGT, GCT, CAG, CAT, CAC, CTC, CCC, GAG, TGA.

So, any TAG or TAA in there? Looking for where the triplet is TAG or TAA.

Looking at codons:

- TAG is in there? Let's see: TAC (no), then CCA (no), TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC (no), AGA, TTA (TTA is Phe), CGC, CAA, ATG, ACT, CTT, GGA, AGA, GTC, GCG, GCC, AGG, ACA, CAG, TTA, CGG, AAA (AAA is Lys), GCA, CAG, CCA, GGT, GCA, GGG, TGG, CGG, GAA, AGC, GCT, GCA, GAG, TTC, GCT, GCT, GTC, GGC, GCC, AGC, GTC, AGG, GCT, GCG, CTG, CAC, GCT, GCC, GGT, GAG, GAG, GAC, GAG, GGC, GAC, ATC, GCG, CTG, CAG, ATC, CAA, GCT, TCT, GCT, GCG, AGA, ACG, ACT, CGA, CAT, AGT (which is Ser), GCG, CGT, GGC, GAT, GTG, CAG, CGG, CTG, GCG, GCG, CAT, CGT, GGG, CGC, CGG, CGA, GAG, GCG, GGG, TGC, GCG, CGG, GCG, GAC, CTG, CAG, CAG, GGT, GCT, CTT, TCG, CAG, GAG, GAG, AGC, GCA, GCG, TTA, CGA, CTG, GGT, GCT, CAG, CAT, CAC, CTC, CCC, GAG, TGA.

I don't see any TAG or TAA in the middle. Only the last codon is TGA. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Wait, the problem could be that the stop codon is actually in the middle, but perhaps due to a mutation. Let's look at the actual sequence again. The first few codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTT GGA AGA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG TGG CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTG CAC GCT GCC GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG CAT CGT GGG CGC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCG CGG GCG GAC CTG CAG CAG GGT GCT CTT TCG CAG GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA CGA CTG GGT GCT CAG CAT CAC CTC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is followed by GADD45G, but if the HA is incorrect, maybe the GADD45G isn't being transcribed correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid has a mistake in the multiple cloning site, like the wrong reading frame.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the cloning introduced an in-frame stop codon. But looking at the sequence, after the HA, the GADD45G coding is present, ending with TGA.

Wait, another angle: the problem might be that the stop codon is not preceded by the proper Kozak sequence, but in mammalian cells, the Kozak sequence is important for initiation. Wait, but the construct starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire construct is in the wrong orientation. If the gene is inserted in the reverse direction, the transcription would be wrong. But the question says that the plasmid's plus strand has the coding sequence, so that's probably correct.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of a stop codon in the HA tag. Let me check the HA tag. The HA tag is usually a short peptide, so the coding sequence is about 10-15 nucleotides. Let's look at the initial part.

The first few codons: ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (start again? That can't be right. Wait, ATG is the start codon, but if it's in the middle, it would cause a new start. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, the HA tag's coding sequence is at the beginning. If the HA has a stop codon, that would cause the protein to be truncated. Let me look at the initial codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT ... So the HA is from ATG to ATG again? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the HA coding sequence was incorrectly cloned, introducing a stop codon.

Hmm, perhaps the HA coding sequence is longer than intended, leading to a premature stop. But the given sequence starts with ATG, which would be the start of the HA. But in the given sequence, the first ATG is followed by TAC, which is tyrosine. The HA tag usually starts with YPYDVPDYA, which in codons would be TAC TTT CCA GAT GTA CCA TTA ... but perhaps a mistake was made.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was not correctly incorporated, leading to a frameshift or a stop codon. For example, if the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon, then the HA would not express the full-length protein.

Wait, in the given coding sequence, after the HA (if any), we have GADD45G. So perhaps the HA includes a stop codon. Let me look at the first few codons again.

ATG (start) TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (start again). Wait, that's a problem. The second ATG is in the same reading frame as the first. That would mean that the ribosome would start translating again at that point, creating a new start codon. But that would lead to a longer ORF, or perhaps a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence was intended to be just a short sequence, but the construct has an ATG in the middle, leading to a new start. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence includes a stop codon. Let me think.

If the HA was supposed to be, say, 10 codons, but the construct has an ATG in the middle, causing the ribosome to restart and create a shorter ORF, leading to a stop codon downstream. For example, perhaps the HA coding sequence was supposed to be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT, and then a stop codon, but instead, the HA is followed by the GADD45G, but with an ATG in the middle, leading to a new start.

Wait, in the given sequence, after the initial ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA, there's another ATG. That would be a second start codon in the same reading frame. But that's not common because start codons are usually only at the beginning. So that might cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, perhaps the presence of a second ATG downstream causes the ribosome to read from there, perhaps leading to a shorter ORF. Let me see: starting from the second ATG, what's the sequence?

The second ATG is at position: let's count. Each codon is 3 nucleotides.

1-3: ATG

4-6: TAC

7-9: CCA

10-12: TAC

13-15: GAT

16-18: GGT

19-21: TCC

22-24: AGA

25-27: TTA

28-30: CGC

31-33: CAA

34-36: ATG (second start codon here)

So from 34-36: ATG

Then 37-39: ACT

40-42: CTT

43-45: GGA

46-48: AGA

49-51: GTC

52-54: GCG

55-57: GCC

58-60: AGG

And so on.

So the second ATG is at position 34-36. The ribosome might see this and start a new reading, ignoring the prior ATG. So the ORF starts at the second ATG. But why would that cause a problem? Well, if the original HA sequence was intended to start with ATG and end before the second ATG, but the construct has the second ATG in the middle, the coding sequence would include the HA followed by the rest, but the ribosome would start at the second ATG, leading to a shorter ORF.

Wait, but the HA is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the correct sequence is HA followed by GADD45G. But if the construct includes an ATG in the middle, the ribosome may start there, leading to the HA being truncated and the GADD45G not being included.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the second ATG introduces a frameshift. Wait, but the same reading frame continues. So no frameshift. So the ORF continues past the second ATG.

Wait, but the presence of a second ATG might not cause a problem unless it's followed by a stop codon. Let me see: from the second ATG, what's the sequence?

ATG ACT CTT GGA AGA GTC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGT GCA GGG TGG CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTG CAC GCT GCC GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCG CAT CGT GGG CGC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCG CGG GCG GAC CTG CAG CAG GGT GCT CTT TCG CAG GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA CGA CTG GGT GCT CAG CAT CAC CTC CCC GAG TGA.

So, the second ATG is followed by ACT (Thr), CTT (Leu), GGA (Gly), etc. Let me see if there's a stop codon in this part.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA in this subsequence. The last codon is TGA, which is at the end. So after the second ATG, the ORF continues all the way to the end, which is TGA. So the presence of the second ATG doesn't introduce a premature stop. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the second ATG is causing the ribosome to start translation earlier. But the first ATG is the correct start, and the second is just another codon in the same frame. So that shouldn't be a problem.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of the HA tag's coding sequence might include a stop codon. Let me check the initial part again.

The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. If the HA's coding sequence is followed by a stop codon, the protein would be truncated. Let me check the initial part for any stop codons.

Looking at the first few codons: TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, ACT, etc. No stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the HA region.

Wait, but the CAA codon is Gln, followed by ATG. So in the HA coding, perhaps the ATG is causing a problem. Because the HA is supposed to be a short peptide, but the construct's coding sequence includes another ATG, which might be part of the HA, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the HA sequence was supposed to end before the second ATG, but the construct includes it, leading to a longer HA and possibly a stop codon downstream. But looking at the sequence, from the second ATG onward, the ORF continues until the end without any internal stop codons except the last one.

So, perhaps the presence of the second ATG is causing the ribosome to terminate early. How?

Wait, ribosomes usually start at the first ATG. If there's a second ATG in the same reading frame, the ribosome doesn't typically re-initiate unless there's a uORF (upstream open reading frame), which usually has a uAUG in the 5' UTR. But in this case, the second ATG is within the coding sequence, not in the UTR. So the ribosome would ignore it and continue to the end.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the second ATG is causing a frameshift or something else. But no, because it's in the same frame.

Wait, another angle: the presence of the HA tag might not be correctly followed by the GADD45G. Let me think about the overall construct. The HA is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. But if the HA has a stop codon, that would cause the protein to terminate early.

Wait, but earlier analysis shows no internal stop codons in the HA region. The HA's codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA. No stop codons here.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the vector has a stop codon before the multiple cloning site. Let me think: the plasmid might have a promoter, then the MCS, then a stop codon. If the gene is inserted in the wrong orientation, the stop would be before the gene, preventing expression.

But the question states that the plus strand has the coding sequence, so the gene is correctly oriented.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. That would change the HA's amino acids, but not necessarily prevent the protein from being expressed. Unless it's a stop codon, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Option B: Ribosome terminates early. That would happen if there's a stop codon upstream. But the only stop codon is at the end.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. That would affect the protein's stability, but not its expression. The protein might be expressed but quickly degraded, but the problem here is that it's not overexpressed, implying it's not being made.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But the stop codon is TGA, which is UGA in mRNA, which is recognized by release factors. So D is not the issue.

Hmm. Another thought: maybe the entire construct has a frameshift due to incorrect cloning. If the insert was cloned in a way that causes a frameshift, the reading frame would be wrong, leading to a shorter ORF with a stop codon.

But looking at the sequence, the plus strand starts with ATG and ends with TGA, with all codons in triplets. So the reading frame is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is followed by a stop codon within the HA region. Let me re-examine the initial part.

The HA is supposed to be short, but the construct's coding sequence continues beyond that. Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was intended to be shorter, but the construct includes more nucleotides, leading to a stop codon.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the HA sequence was incorrectly cloned, introducing a stop codon. Let me think about the HA's amino acid sequence.

The HA tag is typically YPYDVPDYA. The coding sequence for this would be TAC TTT CCA GAT GTA CCA TTA TTA TTA GGT AAA TTA GCA TTA TTA TTA (but I'm not exactly sure of the exact sequence). However, the construct's initial sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT ... So perhaps the HA coding was supposed to be ATG followed by some codons, but the actual sequence has an extra codon (like CGC CAA), leading to a longer HA and perhaps a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was intended to end before the CGC CAA part. If the construct has extra nucleotides, it might have a stop codon. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a stop codon introduced due to a mutation. For example, if the HA's coding sequence has a TGA, that would be a stop. Let me look at the initial part again.

The initial codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q). No stop codons here. So the HA coding sequence doesn't have a stop codon. So option A is unlikely.

Hmm. Another thought: the construct might have a premature stop codon due to incorrect reading frame. For example, if the insert was cloned out of frame, the reading frame would shift, leading to a stop codon. But the given sequence is in triplets, so it's in frame.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the vector's multiple cloning site has a stop codon in the same reading frame as the insert. If the construct is inserted in a way that the vector's stop codon is within the insert, that would cause a problem. But the question says the construct is designed to include the HA and GADD45G, so perhaps the vector's own stop is after the insert.

Wait, but the given sequence ends with TGA, so perhaps that's the intended stop. So perhaps the issue is not with the insert.

Another angle: perhaps the plasmid was not correctly transfected into the cells. But the question says the problem is in the construct's sequence, not the transfection process.

Wait, going back to the options, option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the proteases are cleaving the HA, making the protein unstable. But then, the protein would be expressed but quickly degraded, leading to low detection. The question says that the protein isn't being overexpressed, so perhaps it's not being made at all, not just degraded.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of the HA tag introduces a site for proteolysis. For example, if the HA tag includes a protease cleavage site, the protein could be processed. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon. Wait, earlier analysis didn't find any, but perhaps I missed it.

Wait, the initial part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT ... So the codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (start). So the second ATG is at position 34-36.

Wait, perhaps the HA was supposed to be a certain length, but the construct includes extra nucleotides, leading to an ATG in the middle. For example, the HA should have ended before the second ATG, but the construct includes it, causing the ribosome to read beyond, leading to a longer ORF but not a stop.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA coding sequence includes a stop codon due to a mutation. For instance, if one of the nucleotides changed a codon into a stop. Let me check the HA region again.

The HA codons are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT...

So, the first few amino acids would be Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Gly, Ser, Arg, Leu, Arg, Gln, Met, Thr...

Wait, Met is the start. Then Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Gly, Ser, Arg, Leu, Arg, Gln, Met, Thr...

The HA tag is usually around 10 amino acids. So perhaps the HA was intended to be shorter, but the construct includes more, leading to the HA being longer and possibly including a stop codon.

Wait, but no stop codons are present in the HA region. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's coding sequence has a mutation that introduces a stop codon. For example, if one of the codons became TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let me look again.

The HA's coding is TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA.

Looking for any triplet that could be a stop codon.

- TAC: Tyr
- CCA: Pro
- TAC: Tyr
- GAT: Asp
- GGT: Gly
- TCC: Ser
- AGA: Arg
- TTA: Leu
- CGC: Arg
- CAA: Gln

None of these are stop codons. So option A is not the issue.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the construct's reading frame causes a stop codon. For example, if the insert is in the wrong frame, leading to a stop codon after a few codons.

But the given sequence is in triplets, so the frame is correct.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: the ribosome terminated early. That would require a stop codon upstream. The only stop codon is at the end, so B is unlikely.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. That would affect the protein's stability, but not its expression. So the protein would be present but quickly degraded. The question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, suggesting it's not being made.

Option D: no tRNA for UAA. But the stop codon is TGA, so D is not relevant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the construct's coding sequence is in the wrong orientation. If the gene is cloned in reverse, the mRNA would be complementary, leading to a non-sense mRNA. But the question says the plus strand is the coding sequence, so the orientation is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the vector used doesn't have a promoter, so the gene isn't being transcribed. But the question says the plasmid was transfected, and they selected for antibiotic resistance, implying that the plasmid is functional.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. For example, if the HA includes a stop codon, but earlier analysis didn't find any.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a TAA codon. Let me check the codons again.

The HA region: TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA.

Looking for TAA. The codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA.

TTA is Leu, not a stop. So no TAA.

Hmm. I'm going around in circles. Let me think about the options again.

If the correct answer is option C, then the lack of a linker is causing the protein to be degraded. But the question says that the HA is at the N-terminus. If the HA is followed directly by GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the protein is recognized as a fusion protein and is targeted for degradation by the cell's proteasome. But that would result in low levels of the protein, not a complete lack of expression.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag wasn't correctly expressed, leading to the fusion protein not being made. But the presence of the HA's coding sequence suggests that it is part of the construct.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is not followed by a Kozak sequence for the GADD45G. Kozak sequences are important in eukaryotes for the recognition of the start codon. If the GADD45G's start codon (ATG) doesn't have a proper Kozak sequence, the ribosome might not start translating it.

But in the given sequence, the GADD45G's ATG is preceded by certain nucleotides. Let me see.

The GADD45G's ATG is at position 34-36: ...CAA ATG ACT...

So the sequence before the ATG is CAA, then ATG. The Kozak sequence in mammals is typically 'CCACCAUGG' or similar, where the nucleotides around the ATG influence translation initiation. The presence of a purine (A or G) at position -3 is important. In this case, the ATG is at position 34-36. The nucleotides before it are CAA. So the sequence is CAA ATG. The nucleotide at position -3 is A (from CAA), which is good. So the Kozak sequence is probably okay.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about each option's possibility.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. Unlikely to prevent expression.

Option B: Ribosome terminates early. Only stop is at the end.

Option C: No linker, proteolysis. Affects protein stability, not expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Stop is TGA, so D is irrelevant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA coding sequence includes a stop codon. Let me recheck. The HA's codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA. None are stop codons.

Wait, another thought: the vector may have a polyA signal after the stop codon, but if the construct doesn't include it, the mRNA might not be processed, leading to no protein. But the question implies that the construct is correctly designed, so this is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the HA tag's ATG is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Because the ribosome may think it's a start codon and start a new frame. But no, because it's in the same frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's ATG is causing a frameshift. But no, because it's in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA's ATG is in a different frame, causing a frameshift. Wait, the initial ATG is frame 0. The HA's ATG is in frame 0 as well, so no frameshift.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that the presence of the HA tag's ATG causes the ribosome to read beyond, but the mRNA doesn't have a stop codon until the end. So the protein would be expressed, but perhaps not as intended.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the presence of the HA's ATG is causing the ribosome to read a different ORF, leading to a shorter protein. Let me think: starting from the first ATG, the sequence goes through the HA and into GADD45G. But if the ribosome starts at the second ATG, it would read a different sequence, perhaps leading to a shorter ORF with a stop codon.

Wait, but the second ATG is followed by ACT, CTT, GGA, etc., and the stop codon is at the very end. So the ribosome would read all the way to the end, resulting in a longer ORF than intended. So the protein would be a fusion of HA and GADD45G, but perhaps with an extra part.

Alternatively, perhaps the second ATG is causing a problem because it's in the middle of the HA, leading to a frameshift. But no, because it's in the same frame.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me see if any other clues can help. The problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. The sequence provided is the coding sequence, but perhaps the issue is that the gene is not in the correct reading frame, leading to a frameshift and a stop codon.

Wait, but the sequence is in triplets, so it's in frame. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid's selection marker is not working, so the cells aren't surviving. But the question says the colonies were selected, implying that the antibiotic resistance is functional.

Another possibility: the construct includes a termination codon in the middle, causing the protein to be truncated. But earlier analysis didn't find any.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was followed by a stop codon mistakenly. Let me look again.

The HA's codons: TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q). No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA's sequence includes a stop codon due to a mutation. For example, if a nucleotide changed a codon to TGA. But the given sequence doesn't show that.

Another thought: perhaps the HA's coding sequence is not correctly followed by the GADD45G. For example, if the HA ends with a stop codon, the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed. But the initial sequence doesn't have a stop codon.

Wait, the sequence goes from HA to GADD45G without a stop. So if the HA's coding sequence has a stop, the GADD45G wouldn't be expressed. But I don't see any stop codons in the HA region.

Hmm.

Finally, perhaps the issue is that the HA's coding sequence is in the wrong orientation. If the HA was cloned in reverse, it would produce the wrong amino acids, but the ATG would still be the start codon. But then the HA would be expressed in reverse, which might cause issues, but not necessarily prevent expression.

Wait, but the question says the HA is at the N-terminus, so the construct should have HA followed by GADD45G. If the HA was cloned in reverse, it would be GADD45G followed by HA, which is not the case.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to look at the options again.

Option C says the lack of a linker causes proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the proteases cleave between them, resulting in the HA being released and the GADD45G being unstable. But then the protein would be expressed but quickly degraded, leading to low levels. The question says the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made.

Wait, but proteolysis would occur post-translationally. If the protein is made but quickly degraded, the researcher might not detect it. But the question is about overexpression, not detection. So perhaps the construct is not working, leading to no expression.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon. Let me recheck. The HA's codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA. No stop codons. So option A is not it.

Wait, another possibility: the HA's coding sequence is in the wrong frame, causing a frameshift that introduces a stop codon. For example, if the HA's coding was cloned in a way that shifts the frame, leading to a stop codon downstream.

But the given sequence is in triplets, so it's in frame. So that's not it.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but based on the options, option C seems less likely because it's about proteolysis, not expression. Option B is about early termination, but there's no early stop. Option A is about a missense in HA, which shouldn't prevent expression. Option D is about a non-existent tRNA, but stop codon is TGA, which is recognized.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon due to a mutation. But earlier analysis didn't find any.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was intended to be shorter, and the extra nucleotides introduced a stop codon. For example, if the HA was supposed to be 10 nucleotides but is longer, leading to an ATG followed by a stop.

Wait, the HA's coding sequence is about 30 nucleotides (10 codons). Let me count the initial part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT... So that's 10 codons for HA, and then the GADD45G starts. Wait, but the HA is actually longer than intended, leading to a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence was supposed to end before the CGC CAA part. If the HA was longer, the extra codons may include a stop.

But in the given sequence, there's no stop codon in the HA region.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but based on the options and the sequence, the most plausible answer is option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the second ATG is causing the ribosome to terminate early, but I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: the presence of the second ATG may cause the ribosome to read a different ORF, but in this case, the ORF continues until the end. So the protein would be longer, but not terminated early.

Alternatively, perhaps the second ATG is causing the ribosome to terminate early because it's in the same reading frame and the ribosome thinks it's a new start, leading to a shorter ORF. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the second ATG introduces a uORF, which is an upstream ORF that can inhibit the translation of the main ORF. But uORFs are typically in the 5' UTR, not in the coding region. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm. I think I have to make an educated guess here. Based on the options, the presence of the HA tag followed directly by GADD45G without a linker might cause the protein to be recognized for degradation, but that's about stability, not expression. So the protein would be expressed but not detected. However, the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, which suggests it's not being made at all.

Another angle: perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon introduced by a mutation. For example, a point mutation changed a codon to a stop. Looking at the sequence again, perhaps one of the codons has changed.

Wait, the sequence provided is the plus strand. If there's a mutation in the HA's coding sequence that introduces a stop codon, that would prevent the HA from being expressed, but the GADD45G would still be expressed as a separate protein. But the problem is that the fusion protein isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon. Let me check each codon again.

ATG (start)
TAC (Y)
CCA (P)
TAC (Y)
GAT (D)
GGT (G)
TCC (S)
AGA (R)
TTA (L)
CGC (R)
CAA (Q)
ATG (start again)
ACT (T)
CTT (L)
GGA (G)
AGA (R)
GTC (V)
GCG (A)
GCC (A)
AGG (K)
... and so on.

No stop codons in the HA region. So the HA is correctly expressed, and the GADD45G is also correctly expressed. So why isn't the protein overexpressed?

Wait, perhaps the plasmid doesn't have a promoter. But the question says the plasmid was transfected and colonies were selected, implying the plasmid is functional.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, the most plausible answer is option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. But I'm not entirely sure.


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The researcher introduced a construct containing the HA tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G, but the protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided sequence of the plus strand of the construct was analyzed to determine the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter its amino acid sequence but would not necessarily prevent the protein from being expressed. The HA tag's coding sequence was examined, and no stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) were found in the HA region. Therefore, this option is unlikely to explain the lack of expression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   For the ribosome to terminate early, there would need to be a premature stop codon upstream of the intended stop codon. The sequence analysis revealed that the only stop codon is at the very end (TGA), and no internal stop codons were found in the coding sequence. Thus, this option is also unlikely.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   If a linker sequence is absent between the HA tag and GADD45G, proteases may cleave the protein, leading to degradation. However, this would affect the protein's stability rather than its expression. The question specifies that the protein is not being overexpressed, suggesting it is not being synthesized in the first place. Therefore, while proteolysis could explain the lack of detectable protein, it does not fully account for the absence of expression.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   The stop codon in the construct is TGA, which corresponds to UGA in the mRNA. UGA is a valid stop codon recognized by release factors in mammalian cells, including mice. Thus, this option is irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that the most plausible explanation is **Option C**, as the lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, which might prevent the detection of the protein. However, the question emphasizes the lack of overexpression, which implies that the protein is not being synthesized. Despite this nuance, Option C aligns most closely with the provided context and options.

**Answer: C**
