Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Also, we have to determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate and choose the correct one.

First, I'll start by understanding the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and will react with a strong acid. Since it's a hydroxide, adding an acid (H+) should protonate it.

The reaction equation would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Wait, yes, because each OH- will take a H+ to form water. So each Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+ ions.

Next, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be helpful here. Let me calculate that.

Fe has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17 g/mol (16 O + 1 H). So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

The mass given is 0.1 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me calculate that accurately: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 moles.

Now, the acid is monobasic and strong, which means it donates one H+ per molecule and fully dissociates. So the concentration is 0.1 M (molar), and we need to find the volume that provides at least 0.0028074 moles of H+.

Using the formula: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So volume = moles / Molarity.

Volume = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L → which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have exactly this number. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That's really close. But wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, 0.0009358 *3 is 0.00
