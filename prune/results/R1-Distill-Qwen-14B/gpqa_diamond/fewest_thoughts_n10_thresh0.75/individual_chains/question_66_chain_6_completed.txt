Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I know that in any relativistic quantum field theory, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is a relativistic theory, so all its operators should be Lorentz invariant. So option 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. Wait, Poincaré includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But when you write effective field theories, you generally include all terms that are consistent with the underlying symmetry. Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and the operators are constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So since the Standard Model respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT would too. But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. I think that the operators in SMEFT are organized by their dimension and their Lorentz and gauge quantum numbers. So, does that mean they automatically respect Poincaré? Well, I think yes because Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincaré, and all the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So 2 is also something they respect.

Wait, no, wait. Poincaré symmetry includes both the Lorentz group and translations. The translation part is about momentum conservation, etc. But SMEFT is an effective theory where you have higher-dimensional operators, which are of the form (1/Lambda^n) times some term. But when you include these higher-dimension terms, you might have to make sure that they don't break Poincaré symmetry. Wait, but SMEFT is constructed to be a Poincaré-invariant theory. Because all the terms are written in a way that doesn't introduce explicit momentum dependence beyond the usual terms. So yes, I think Poincaré symmetry is respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. I've read that effective theories can sometimes break Poincaré symmetry because they include operators that aren't local. Or wait, no, SMEFT is constructed in a way to maintain all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincaré. So SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré symmetry, which includes both Lorentz and translation.

Wait, but the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if a symmetry is automatically respected because the operators are constructed that way, then it's a must. So for Lorentz and Poincaré, yes.

Then, what about CP symmetry? I remember that the Standard Model respects CP symmetry (except for certain parts like in the CKM matrix which leads to CP violation in certain processes). But wait, the question is about SMEFT. Do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CP symmetry? Or can they break it?

Wait, the Standard Model has CP violation, but in SMEFT, operators can induce new sources of CP violation if the Wilson coefficients are complex. Or do the operators have to be CP even? I think SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP, provided the underlying theory (like a UV completion) has CP violation. So not all operators necessarily respect CP. So symmetry 3 (CP) may not be a must. So 3 is not a required symmetry.

Now, CPT symmetry. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the combination of C, P, and T transformations must be a symmetry if the theory is Lorentz invariant. So since all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is a must.

So putting it all together: must-respect symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincaré), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that SMEFT includes Poincaré symmetry. So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4? Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A)1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So if the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4, then the answer is option C.

Wait, but someone might argue whether all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry. Because the effective theory includes higher-dimensional operators, but each operator is a local Lorentz scalar. So perhaps Poincaré symmetry is automatically respected as well because the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars and the theory is built in a way that respects momentum conservation. So yes, I think 2 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes relativistic principles. Here's the analysis of the given symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic theory, and all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. SMEFT operators are constructed as local Lorentz scalars, and the theory maintains momentum conservation, ensuring that Poincaré symmetry (2) is also respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: While the Standard Model respects CP symmetry, SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP symmetry if the underlying theory (e.g., a UV completion) introduces CP violation. Thus, CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry (4).

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
