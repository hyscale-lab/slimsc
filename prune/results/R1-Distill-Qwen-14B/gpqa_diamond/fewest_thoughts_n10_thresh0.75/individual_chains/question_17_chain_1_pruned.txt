Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The question says it's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The problem gives me the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constant... right. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So if I have Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combining to form CaEDTA^2-, the reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- 

And Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. Assuming that the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form, so I don't have to worry about other protonated forms of EDTA. That's good; it simplifies things.

So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But because Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation is not significant. Wait, no. Wait, Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low.

Let me think about this. The solution is 0.02 M in the complex, so the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because Kf is large).

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x (because each mole of complex releases one mole of each ion).

So the Kf expression is:

Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0
