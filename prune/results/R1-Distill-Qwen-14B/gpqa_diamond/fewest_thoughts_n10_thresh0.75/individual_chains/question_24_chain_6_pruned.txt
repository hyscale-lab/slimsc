Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, okay, so it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a mixture X that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water anymore. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions with Pt, give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, and it's a solvent, probably something common like hexane or something similar. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which suggests it's fully saturatedâ€”maybe an alkane.

Mixture X is equimolar and when treated with Pt under heat gives Y, which is also equimolar but made of different liquids. Also, X doesn't have conjugated multiple bonds, which probably means any double bonds are isolated or maybe only one double bond, not conjugated.

So, first, what is mixture X? It decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually implies that there's some unsaturation, like double bonds or triple bonds. So X must have substances with alkenes, alkynes, or maybe some conjugated dienes. But wait, the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds, so perhaps each molecule in X has a single double bond or triple bond, not conjugated.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a reaction. The product is Y, which no longer decolorizes bromine. So Y's components don't have any double or triple bonds, or perhaps they have different structures that don't react with bromine. But wait, what kind of reaction would convert an alkene to something else without double bonds? Hydrogenation comes to mind. But wait, in the problem, X and Y are both mixtures that are hydrogenated to give Z. So the hydrogenation is a separate step.

Wait, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it's a reaction that causes a change. Since Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation, maybe it's hydrogenation itself. But then, if X is hydrogenated, it would form Y. But wait, the question says that X, when treated with Pt and heated, gives Y via a disproportionation reaction. Oh, wait, wait, the question says: "is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation."

Oh, right, so it's a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps a molecule in X is getting split into two different products. So let's think: what kind of compounds undergo disproportionation when heated with Pt?

Wait, maybe it's something like a ketone or an alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X has some alkenes that undergo some kind of reaction upon hydrogenation, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but the hydrogenation of X and Y both gives the same product Z. So if X and Y are different mixtures, but when hydrogenated, they give the same Z. That
