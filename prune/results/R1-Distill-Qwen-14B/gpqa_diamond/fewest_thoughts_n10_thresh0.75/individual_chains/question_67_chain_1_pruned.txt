Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number l=1. Oh wait, each electron has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So, for each electron, l1 and l2 are both 1.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait a second, I thought when you couple two angular momenta, the total l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since both are 1, the possible total l's are 0, 1, 2. So l=2 is the maximum here, which makes sense as 1+1=2. So the state is a combination of the two individual angular momenta adding up to l=2, and m=-1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So we're ignoring spin, and just looking at the orbital angular momentum components along the z-axis.

Wait, the orbital angular momentum operator for each particle is L1z and L2z, right? So each of these has eigenvalues mħ, where m can be -l, ..., +l. For l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So each Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

We're to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. So, what's the state of the system? It's |l1=1, l2=1, total l=2, m=-1>.

I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of individual l1 and l2 states. Because the coupled state is a combination of all possible |l1, m1> |l2, m2> states that add up to l=2 and m=-1.

So, the total state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = -1. Because m is the sum of
