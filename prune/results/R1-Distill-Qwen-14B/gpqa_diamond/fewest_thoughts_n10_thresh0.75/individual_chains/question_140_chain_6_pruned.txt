Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and some product B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. I remember that water has a melting point of 273 K, so B must be something similar but maybe a bit different, like ice? Wait, no, ice is solid water. But wait, 277 K is a bit higher than 0 degrees Celsius, which is 273 K. Hmm, maybe it's something else. What's a substance that melts around that temperature? Maybe another type of hydrate or something similar.

The gas W has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about gases. Common gases are like H2, O2, N2, CO2, etc. Wait, if the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, that's interesting. Let's see, like for example, H2 has 1 proton each, so 2 protons total. Each H is 1 neutron? No, hydrogen usually has 0 neutrons. So maybe a heavier gas. Let me think—maybe CO2? No, CO2 has 22 protons (C=6, O=8 each ×2, so 22). Then the neutrons would be the sum of the isotopes. Wait, but that might not fit the equal part. Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, that's a gas but not sure about the neutron count. Wait, perhaps it's something like NH3? No, but that's a liquid sometimes. Hmm. Alternatively, think about H2O. H2O has 8 protons in each O and 1 each in H. Wait, but the molecule as a whole. H2O has 10 protons (2×1 + 8). The number of neutrons would be the sum of all neutrons in the molecule. Let's see, if it's regular H2O, each H has 0 neutrons, and O has 8, but wait, no, isotopes complicate this. Wait, maybe the gas is something like Cl2? Chlorine has 17 protons each. So Cl2
