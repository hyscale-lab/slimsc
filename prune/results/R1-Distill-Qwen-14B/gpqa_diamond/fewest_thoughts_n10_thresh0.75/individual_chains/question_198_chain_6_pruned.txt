Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is correct.

So from what I remember, when you have ions in solution and a ligand like SCN-, they form complexes. The stability constant, β, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because the reaction goes more to the product.

The problem gives me the stability constants for the different complexes. β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I should probably note which complex corresponds to each β. Typically, the subscripts go in order of the number of ligands. Like, Co(SCN)_1^x would have β1, Co(SCN)_2^y β2, and so on. But wait, I'm not sure about the charge here, but maybe it's not critical for this question.

The concentrations given are [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So Co is in solution as Co^2+, and SCN- is abundant.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands attached. So the species in question is the second complex, which has β2=40. Or wait, the first complex is with one SCN-, second with two, third with three, and fourth with four. So, yes, the blue one is the one with two ligands, so β2=40.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought that the color of the complex depends on the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ has different colors for different n. So the blue one is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^+, but I'm not certain. Well, the question states this, so I can proceed.

The approach I think is needed is to calculate the fraction of each complex present and then find the percentage of the desired one. To do that,
