Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that stability constants (β) are involved in these kinds of problems. Stability constants tell us how stable a complex is compared to its dissociated form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I think these are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, the complexes would be:
- Co²+ (the free ion) which I guess is the first species, but wait, β1 is 9. So maybe β1 is for the first complex, like [Co(SCN)]^+? Or perhaps β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^2+? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the stability constant β is for the formation of a complex from its constituent ions. For each step, I think. So the formation goes in steps:

Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1)
[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2)
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3)
[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (β4)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the charges. Let me think. Each SCN- is -1. So Co²+ plus one SCN- would be Co(SCN) with a charge of +1. Then adding another SCN- makes it neutral, and so on. So the complexes would have 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ligands.

Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2
