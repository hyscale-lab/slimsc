Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me try to work through it. So the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. And the given information is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait. Let me think about what I know. When particles annihilate, they convert into other particles. But here, it's a proton and antiproton annihilating into two A+ and two A- particles. So, I think this is a conservation problem. Conservation of energy and momentum must apply here.

Since the system starts with a proton and an antiproton, maybe I should think about their rest masses. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? So the proton's rest energy is around 938 MeV. The antiproton would have the same mass as the proton because they're antiparticles—so same mass, same energy. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so it's moving at a low speed, meaning its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe I can approximate that its total energy is just its rest mass energy plus a small kinetic part. But perhaps it's easier to model this as a system where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, but wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Or maybe the initial momentum isn't zero? Hmm.

Wait, no. Let's
