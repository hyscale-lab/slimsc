Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit shaky on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it logically.

The question is about a reaction scheme leading to compound E. There are several steps involved, and I need to figure out what E is based on the given information.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

There are also two hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the formation of alkenes via the Wittig reaction. So, when A reacts with a ylide, it forms an alkene. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize this structure.

The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The substituents at positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached. So the ring has a double bond from the ylidene group.

Wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene), which is an alkenyl group. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide (which has a phosphorus) with a carbonyl group. So compound A must have a carbonyl group because the Wittig reaction requires that.

So, A is a carbonyl compound. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the starting material A would be a cyclopentanone derivative because the Wittig would form an alkene from a ketone.

Let me think. The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the R2P=CH- group. So if the product has a double bond at position 4, then A must have a carbonyl group at position 4 perhaps. Let me draw this.

Wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has a substituent that's a double bond (the ylidene part). The structure would be:

Positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups. Position 4 has a CH2-C(CH3)2 group, but wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the double bond is between the cyclopentane ring and the adjacent carbon.

So when the ylide (which is a strong base) attacks the carbonyl of A, it forms the alkene. So A would have a carbonyl group where the double bond is formed. Therefore, A is a cyclopentanone derivative with a carbonyl at the position where the ylide adds.

Wait, in the product, the substituent is at position 4. So, the starting ketone would have a carbonyl at position 4 of the cyclopentane. So A would be 4-oxocyclopentane with substituents elsewhere.

Wait, but the product has 1,2-dimethyl groups. So perhaps the starting material A (the ketone) has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2? Because the Wittig would add the R group to the carbonyl carbon. Let me think.

Wait, no. The Wittig reaction forms the double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the ylide's carbon. So for cyclopentanone, the carbonyl is at position 1 (assuming cyclopentanone is 1-ketone). But in the product, the substituent is at position 4. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentanone has substituents elsewhere. Let me think: if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, then the carbonyl in A would be at position 4. Because the Wittig would add the R group to the carbonyl carbon, forming a double bond between the carbonyl carbon (say, position 4) and the next carbon.

Wait, but cyclopentane is a five-membered ring. Let me number the positions. If the carbonyl is at position 4, the adjacent carbons are 3 and 5. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Let me try to imagine the structure. The product has a cyclopentane ring with a double bond substituent at position 4. So the structure would look like:

Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Position 4 has a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a substituent that's a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the ring.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the structure would have a double bond between the ring carbon and the adjacent carbon in the substituent. So the substituent is at position 4 of the cyclopentane.

So, the starting compound A would be a cyclopentanone with a substituent, perhaps a carbonyl at position 4. Wait, but cyclopentanone is a five-membered ring with one ketone group. So if A is 4
