Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. 

The question says that both planets have the same minimum mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times less than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P days, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, their host stars have the same radius but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one for Planet_2. Both have circular orbits.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for the probability is (R_star / a) squared, but wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by some other factors. Alternatively, I recall that the transit probability is roughly (R_*)^2 / (a^2), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no. Let me think. The probability is actually proportional to (R_star / a)^2, but wait, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star/a. But wait, that's not right. Oh wait, I think the probability of a planet transiting is approximately (R_*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the bigger R* is, the higher the probability. But wait, no, because if a is small, the probability is higher because the planet is closer, and thus more likely to pass in front.

Wait, let's go back. The transit probability (P) is given by P = (R_* + R_p)/(a) multiplied by some other factors. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_*/a. But wait, that can't be, because if a is smaller, R_*/a is larger, so the probability would be higher. So a planet closer in (smaller a) has a higher chance of transiting. But wait, that's not correct because if the planet is closer, the star appears larger in the sky, so the area where the planet can be for a transit is a larger portion of the orbit.

Alternatively, I think I remember the transit probability formula as (R_*)^2/(a^2), but I might be getting that wrong. Wait, actually, the probability is (R_*)/a times some factor. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the relative sizes. The transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit projected in the plane of the sky. But wait, the area of the star is π(R_*)², and the area related to the orbit is πa² (since the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a). So the probability is (R_* / a)^2. Oh wait, but that would be the case if the planet's orbit is edge-on. Wait, no, the actual formula for transit probability is (R_* / a) * (something else), possibly involving the inclination.

Wait, no, I'm confusing it with the concept of the transit depth. The transit depth is (R_p / R_*)^2. But the probability of transit is another matter.

Let me try to recall. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will produce a transit is proportional to (R_* / a)^2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, some sources say that the probability is (R_*)/(a), multiplied by a factor involving the inclination. Wait, I think the exact formula is: P = (R_* + R_p) / a * [ (1 + (R_p)/(R_*)) ] / (1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2)) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the transit probability is P = (R_*)/a, but considering that the planet's orbit must be aligned within a certain angle. So the probability is (R_*)/a multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet passes in front. Wait, no, the formula is actually P = (R_*)/a multiplied by a factor based on the impact parameter. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The probability of a planet transiting its star is given by (R_*/a), assuming that the planet's orbit is randomly oriented. Because if the semi-major axis a is larger, the planet is less likely to pass in front of the star from our viewpoint. So for a given star, a planet with a smaller a has a higher transit probability.

In this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. The period is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law: (P^2) = (4π²/G(M_* + m_p)) * a^3. Since m_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_*). So a³ = (G M_* P²)/(4π²).

Given that both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses. Planet 1's star has twice the mass of Planet 2's star. Let's denote the mass of Planet 2's star as M, so Planet 1's star is 2M.

Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 /3, because it's three times shorter.

So, for a1 (Planet_1's semi-major axis):

a1³ = (G*(2M)*(P1)^2)/(4π²) = (G*(2M)*(P2/3)^2)/(4π²) = (2M P2² G )/(9*4π²).

For a2 (Planet_2's semi-major axis):

a2³ = (G*M*(P2)^2)/(4π²).

So the ratio a1³/a2³ = [ (2M P2² G)/(9*4π²) ] / [ (G M P2²)/(4π²) ) ] = (2M)/(9*4π²) * (4π²)/(G M P2²) ) Wait, perhaps better to compute a1/a2.

Taking the cube roots:

a1/a2 = [ (2M P2²/(9)) / (M P2²) ) ]^(1/3) = [ (2 /9) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606. So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 is 0.2222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606.

Wait, wait, let me compute it properly. Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606, since (0.6)^3 is 0.216, (0.61)^3 is 0.61*0.61=0.3721, *0.61≈0.227. So 0.61^3≈0.227, which is a bit higher than 0.222. So cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606 a2.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is proportional to (R_*/a). But the host stars have the same radius, R_*, since they have the same radii. So the probability for each is proportional to R_*/a. Since R_* is the same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P1 ∝ 1/a1.

Similarly, P2 ∝ 1/a2.

So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 = (1/a1)/(1/a2) ) = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, so Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the transit probability is (R_*/a), and since R_*, is the same for both, Planet_1 has a smaller a, so (R_*/a) is larger. Hence, higher probability.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than that for Planet_2 by a factor of approximately 1.65.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the factor is about 1.65, so option C is correct.

Wait, but how did I get a2/a1 to be 1.65? Because a1 is smaller than a2, right? a1 is approximately 0.606 a2, so a2 is about 1.65 a1.

Wait, a2 = a1 / 0.606 → a2 = a1 * 1.65. So a2 is 1.65 times a1. So a1 = a2 / 1.65.

Wait, then the ratio P1/P2 = a2/a1 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 is preferred, and the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Wait, but looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Yes, that's correct. So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability of a transit depends inversely on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period (\( P \)) and the mass of the host star (\( M_* \)) by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*}
\]

For Planet_1, the host star's mass is \( 2M \), and the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). For Planet_2, the host star's mass is \( M \), and the orbital period is \( P_2 \). Substituting these into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{(2M)(P_1^2)}{M(P_2^2)} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \, a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \, a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606 \, a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1. The correct option is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
