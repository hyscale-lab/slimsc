Okay, so I have this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution relating the energy levels to temperature. 

So the Boltzmann factor is probably involved here. The formula I think is the ratio of the populations of two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. 

Wait, but in this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and the excitation here is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. So let's translate that. 

Let me denote the energy levels as E_upper and E_lower. The difference is E_upper - E_lower = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

The excitation is the population in the upper level compared to the lower. So for star_1, n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2, perhaps? Or wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe it's the ratio of the upper to lower level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps it's the population of a specific level being twice. Hmm, not sure, but let's proceed.

Let me think: the ratio of the upper to lower level populations is given by n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Because higher energy states are less populated. 

Wait, no, wait: the Boltzmann factor is (upper energy is higher, so the exponent is negative). So the ratio is n_upper / n_lower = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (kT) ) = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). 

So for star_1 and star_2, let's say the ratio for star_1 is R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2) )? Because star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me read again: the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. 

Wait, perhaps the ratio is R = (n_upper)/(n_lower) for each star. So R1 = 2 * R2. Because star_1's excitation is higher. 

Alternatively, maybe the population in the upper level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Hmm.

Let me clarify: the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. Oh, wait, maybe it's the excitation potential that's being referred to. Or perhaps the
