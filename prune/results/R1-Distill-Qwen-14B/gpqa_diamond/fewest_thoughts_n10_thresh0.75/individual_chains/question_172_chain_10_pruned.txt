Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms relates to temperature. Let me think. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution is involved here.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, but the exact energy value might not be directly needed here because the options don't have numbers, just variables like T1 and T2.

In LTE, the Boltzmann equation applies. The equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of excitation. So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the excitation as the ratio of upper to lower states. So for star_1, it's 2 times star_2's ratio.

Wait, no. The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the population in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2 for the same level? Or perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher.

Wait the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, so ΔE is same. So the excitation depends on temperature because the exponential term changes with T.

So if the excitation level is higher in star_1, that suggests that star_1 has a higher temperature. Because higher T makes the exponential term closer to 1, meaning more atoms are in higher energy states.

Let me get back to the Boltzmann equation. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star_2: (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = (g2/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower). But if the
