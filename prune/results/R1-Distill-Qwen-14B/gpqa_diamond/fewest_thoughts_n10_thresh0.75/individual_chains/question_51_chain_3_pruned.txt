Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this setup. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, what do I remember about potentials and conducting spheres? Grounded means the sphere is connected to the Earth, so any excess charge would go into the ground. Oh right, so if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges on it would cause the sphere to stay neutral. Or wait, no, wait—if the sphere is neutral to begin with and then a charge is placed near it, the charge would induce charges on the sphere.

Wait, no. If the sphere is grounded, it's at zero potential. So any charges on the sphere are free to move, so the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. That means the induced charges will be such that the potential due to all sources (the charge q and the induced charges) at the sphere's surface is zero.

But how does that affect the potential energy of the system?

Potential energy in electrostatics is usually calculated by the work done to bring charges together. But in this case, the charge q is placed outside the sphere. I think I can model this as charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but wait—grounded conducting spheres have the property that the potential on their surface
