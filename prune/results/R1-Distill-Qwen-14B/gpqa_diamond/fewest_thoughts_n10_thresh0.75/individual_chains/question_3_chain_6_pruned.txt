Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. The particle is in a specific superposition state, and the operator is given as 10σz + 5σx. The options are provided, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And |↑⟩, |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. Oh right, σz is the Pauli z-matrix. So, σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. 

Wait, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, right? So for the operator O = 10σz +5σx, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. 

I think I can break this down into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, so I can separate them.

Let me first compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in this state should be easy. 

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. The wavefunction coefficients are a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2.

So for σz, the expectation value is |a|^2*(eigenvalue for |↑⟩) + |b|^2*(eigenvalue for |↓⟩). The eigenvalues are +1 and -1 respectively.

So |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now I need to find ⟨σx⟩. This might be a bit trickier. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So I have to express σx in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, or perhaps rewrite the state in the σx eigenbasis.

Wait, I remember that σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute ⟨σx⟩ by using matrix representation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for expectation value of σx in terms of the state's coefficients.

I recall that σx is represented by the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So, if our state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is a*(b*) + b*(a*), since σx swaps the states.

Wait, let me think. The expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ would be (a*, 0) [σx matrix] (a, b)†, but I think I might be mixing up the order.

Alternatively, more carefully: σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So,

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| ] σx [ a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩ ]

Applying σx, we get a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

So:

= a* [ a ⟨↑| σx |↑⟩ + b ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ ] + b*
