Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's start by breaking down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. So, maybe the compound has an -OH group. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is typical for a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or an aldehyde. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps an amide, but I don't see any info about N in the problem. Alternatively, maybe it's conjugated, like in a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl at 1700, that's a common region. The 1650 might be a C=C stretch or possibly an aromatic ring. But why two strong peaks in the carbonyl region? Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond. The presence of multiple peaks suggests more than one environment, maybe different substituents around the double bond.

Now the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments: maybe a methyl group with some oxygen? Let's see, a CH3O group would be 31 (CH3O is 16+12+1*3=32? Wait, O is 16, so 16+3=19, plus the CH3 which is 15 (12+3). Wait, 15+16=31. Oh, but wait, 45 is more. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O? If it's something like a ketone, like acetone, but that's 58. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde group losing something. Wait, 45 could be C3H7O or something else. Let me think of possible fragments. Another thought: a common fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+) which is 91, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a ketene? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a CH2O group, which is 30, but that's not 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be something like (CH2)2O, which is 44. Wait, 44 is close. But the peak is at 45. Maybe it's a CH3CO+ fragment? That would be 43 (12*2 + 3 + 16 = 43). Not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the fragment is an ethylene group attached to something. Another approach: think about the possible molecular formulas and see which one can break into a fragment of 45.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So, let's think about each formula:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible functional groups could be a diol, or an ester, or a ketone and an alcohol, etc. The IR has two carbonyl peaks, so maybe ester. Ester's carbonyl is around 1700. Another peak at 1650 might be conjugated, like an aromatic ring but not sure. Alternatively, maybe an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. That would be a molecular formula similar to something with a double bond and an alcohol or ether. But the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, which might not fit because an alcohol doesn't have a carbonyl. Unless the compound is a ketone and an alcohol. But wait, the molecular formula for B is C6H10O. If it's a ketone and an alcohol, then the formula would be C6H10O2. So B might not fit.

Option C: C6H10O2. This could be an ester, perhaps. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. The carbonyl would be around 1700. Maybe another group causing the 1650 peak. Also, esters can have an oxygen count of two.

Option D: C6H12O. This would be something like a diol or an ether with a double bond. But again, the two carbonyls in IR would not fit unless it's a ketone and an alcohol, but D is C6H12O, which would make it O only once. So probably not.

Wait, but the FTIR has two strong peaks around 1700 and 1650. A ketone and an ester? Maybe not, because an ester carbonyl is around 1700, but a conjugated carbonyl can be lower. Alternatively, perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups? Like an aromatic ester or a ketone.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So the compound likely has a double bond, which would correspond to a degree of unsaturation. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - O)/2.

Let's compute for each option.

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2 = 0/2 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because a molecule with 6 C, 12 H, and 2 O. Let's see:

Wait, the formula is C6H12O2.

The general formula for an alcohol is CnH2n+1OH. For O=2, perhaps ester. Ester formula is CnH2nO2. So for n=3, it would be C3H6O2. But our option is C6H12O2. So n=6? That would imply a larger ester. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester. Alternatively, maybe a molecule with two rings or double bonds.

Wait, DoU calculation:

For C6H12O2:

DoU = [2*(6) +2 -12 -2*1 (because O is 2)] / 2.

Wait, no. The formula is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2*6 + 2 -12 - 2*O)/2. Wait, no, O is part of the formula in the molecule, but in DoU calculation, O is subtracted as 1 per O. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens and N is nitrogens. So for O, we don't subtract anything. Wait, no, O doesn't affect the DoU formula.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the DoU correctly.

Each DoU is a ring or a double bond.

For any formula, the degree of unsaturation is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

So for each compound, let's compute it.

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 2/2=1.

So one DoU. That could be a double bond or a ring.

Option B: C=6, H=10, O=1.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Two DoUs. Could be two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C=6, H=10, O=2.

DoU = (14 -10 -2*O)? Wait no, O doesn't affect DoU. Wait, the formula is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

So for C=6, H=10, O=2.

DoU = (12 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2.

Two DoUs.

Option D: C=6, H=12, O=1.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So A and D have 1 DoU each, B and C have 2 each.

Now, the presence of vinyl hydrogens (double bond) accounts for one DoU. So, the compound must have at least one double bond. So, if the DoU is 1 (A or D), that's a single ring or a single double bond. But if the DoU is 2 (B or C), then it's either two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, or two rings.

But looking at the IR data, we've got two peaks in the carbonyl region (1700 and 1650). Each carbonyl group (like ketone, ester, aldehyde) contributes one DoU. So two carbonyl groups would account for two DoUs. That would make the DoU 2, which points to options B and C.

So options B and C have 2 DoUs, A and D have 1.

So the compound likely has two carbonyl groups. But wait, the FTIR shows two strong peaks. So maybe two carbonyls, each contributing a peak. So the molecular formula must have two oxygen-containing groups that have carbonyls, like two ester groups, or a ketone and an ester, or perhaps a conjugated system?

Wait, but let's think about the IR peaks. A peak at 1700 is a strong carbonyl, which is typical for esters, ketones, aldehydes. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. So maybe the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group, which would have a lower wavenumber. That would account for the two peaks. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone (a conjugated ketone with a double bond).

In that case, the molecule would have a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR) and a conjugated ketone. So that's two DoUs: one from the double bond, another from the ketone.

So the molecular formula should have two DoUs. So that would be option B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2).

Wait, but carbonyl groups add to the DoU. So if there's a conjugated carbonyl, that's one DoU. The double bond is another, so DoU is 2. So the formula would have two DoUs, which is options B and C.

But let's check the options again.

Option B: C6H10O.

That would have a formula like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with an -OH group. But wait, the IR showed a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group, as that's typical for alcohol O-H stretches.

So if the compound has an -OH group (as per the broad peak), and a conjugated carbonyl (two DoUs), then the formula would be C6H10O. But wait, the IR has two carbonyl peaks, so two carbonyl groups? Or maybe the same carbonyl group appearing in two regions due to conjugation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two peaks are due to different types of carbonyl groups. Like an ester and a ketone. So two different carbonyls.

So the formula would have two oxygen atoms, as in options C (C6H10O2) or A (C6H12O2). Let's see.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which is typically O-H. So the compound likely contains an -OH group, so the formula must have at least one O. 

Looking back at the options, all have at least one O.

So if the compound has an -OH group (so O is at least 1), and two carbonyl groups (so O increases), then the formula would have O=2. That would point to options A, C.

Wait, but earlier I thought options B and C have two DoUs. So let's reevaluate.

Wait, option A is C6H12O2. DoU is 1. Hmm, but two carbonyl groups would require two DoUs. So that's a problem because option A has only one DoU.

So perhaps the two IR peaks are not both carbonyls. Maybe one is a carbonyl, and the other is an aromatic ring. Because aromatic C=C's have peaks around 1600-1450 cm⁻¹. Wait, but the peak is at 1650, which is on the higher end for aromatic C=C. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 peak is an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. So if the compound has a benzene ring, which would have DoU 4 (since benzene is three double bonds). But our options have only 1 or 2 DoUs, so that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So that's one carbonyl group and a double bond. So if the molecule has a ketone (one carbonyl) and a conjugated double bond, that would account for the 1700 and 1650 peaks. Wait, but then only one carbonyl. Then why two peaks? Maybe the 1650 is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring. But without an aromatic ring, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is a C=C stretch from a double bond, not a carbonyl. But then why is it so high? C=C typically is around 1600-1680. So 1650 is possible for a C=C. So the two peaks in IR are a carbonyl (1700) and a C=C (1650). So in that case, the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, which would account for two DoUs.

So the formula must have two DoUs, which would be options B and C.

But option B is C6H10O. If that's the case, then the formula has one O. So if the compound has a carbonyl (O), and an -OH (O), that would be two Os. But option B only has one O. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the compound has an ester group. An ester has two O's (R-O-CO-R'). So maybe the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C. So the structure could be an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that would have the same oxygen count as an ester.

So looking back, the mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z=45. What could that be?

Let me think about possible fragments. For example, 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion) which is 58? Wait, no. Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one), molecular weight is 58. But the fragment is at 45.

Wait, let's compute 45: 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see the possible combinations. 45 = 12*C + 1*H +16*O + etc. Let's see:

Possible combinations:

- C3H7O: 3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59. No, that's 59.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's a fragment without oxygen. 45 could be C3H7+ (which is 3*12 +7=43? No, 43. Not 45.) Alternatively, C3H5+ is 3*12 +5=41. Not 45.

Wait, maybe a fragment with two oxygen atoms: like (CH3COO)+? Let's see, CH3COO is 60 (12+3*1) + (12+16) + 16 (O) → 12*2 + (3+1) + 16*2 = 24 +4 +32=60, which is m/z 60. Not matching.

Alternatively, a fragment of (CH2)2O would be 30, but that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is one of the options. Let's compute the molecular weight of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2 → (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16)=72+12+32=116. So molecular weight is 116. So any fragment would be less than that.

Option B: C6H10O → (6×12)+(10×1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2 → (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16)=72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O → 72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular weight of the compound would be 98, 100, 114, or 116, depending on the option.

The fragment at m/z 45 must be a part of the molecule. Let's see which of these options can break into a 45 fragment.

Option A: 116. 116-45=71. So the rest would be 71. 71 is a possible fragment (like C4H7+ which is 55? No, 55 is C3H7+. Hmm, 71 could be C5H11? No, wait, 5×12 +11=60+11=71. That's possible. But I'm not sure if that's meaningful.

Option B: 98. 98-45=53. 53 is a possible fragment, like C3H5O (3×12=36 +5=41 +16=57? No. Hmm, maybe C4H7+ is 55. 53 is C3H5O2?) Not sure.

Option C: 114-45=69. 69 could be C4H9+ (57) plus 12 is 69? No, 4×12=48 +9=57. Not 69. Wait, perhaps C5H13? 5×12+13=60+13=73. No. Maybe something else.

Option D: 100-45=55. 55 is C3H7+ which is 3×12 +7=43, but 55. Oh, 55 could be C4H3O: 4×12=48 +3=51 +16=67. No. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a smaller group. Let me think about the possible fragments.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO+, which is 59? No. Wait, acetone is 58. So maybe a different fragment.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH2O) + something? Or maybe a CH2CH2O group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group with some other atoms.

Wait, another idea: 45 could be the molecular weight of a CH3COO- group. Let's compute: CH3COO- is 12×2 + 3×1 + 16×2 =24 +3 +32=59. No, that's 59. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO+ fragment. That is, 43 (12×2 + 3×1= 27) + something. Wait, 43 is the molecular weight of CH3CO+ (43). So 43, but the fragment is at 45. Close but not exact.

Wait, 45 is 43 plus 2, so maybe CH3CO plus something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, which is (RCO), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group attached in a way that gives m/z=45. Wait, ethyl group is 29, so not 45.

Hmm, maybe it's a propyl group with an oxygen. Propane has 3*12 +8=44 (C3H8 is 44?), but that's 44, close to 45.

Wait, 45 is 44 plus 1, so perhaps C3H8O. Let's see: C3H8O is 3×12 +8 +16=36+8+16=60. No, that's 60.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the fragment. Maybe another approach: which of the options could lose a fragment of 45?

For instance, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which has a molecular weight of 114. Then, 114-45=69. 69 could be C4H9O (4×12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73, which is more than 69). Alternatively, C5H11O would be 5×12 +11 +16=60+11+16=87. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts, one of which is 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, maybe it's a diester or something that can split into a smaller ester and another part. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a fragment that breaks off.

Wait, another idea: the peak at 45 could be a tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe a cyclopropane ring? I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 44 (12×2 + 16= 40? Wait, (CH2)2O is C2H4O. Molecular weight: 2×12 +4 +16=24 +4 +16=44. So m/z 44. But the peak is at 45. Oh, maybe an error, but perhaps it's a different fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3)COH, which would be 12×2 +3 +16 +1 = 54. No, that's 54.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should consider each option and see which fits.

Looking again:

FTIR shows O-H (broad), two carbonyls (or one carbonyl and another group). So possible structures:

If the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond. For example, ethyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOEt. That would have a carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated double bond could cause a peak around 1650.

The molecular formula for ethyl acrylate is C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A). So perhaps a similar structure but with more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is methyl vinyl ketone: (CH2)C(O)CH2CH3. That's C5H8O. But the options don't have that.

Wait, let's think of a compound that has an ester group and a double bond.

For example, methyl vinyl ester: CH2=CHCOOCH3. Formula is C5H8O2. Hmm, not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps propyl something. Let me think of a compound with formula C6H10O2.

Wait, another approach: the presence of vinyl hydrogens and two carbonyls suggests a structure with a conjugated system. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group.

The formula for CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would be C6H10O2. Because CH2=CHCOO- is C4H5O2, and the ethyl group is C2H5. So total is C6H10O2, which is option C.

In this case, the FTIR would show a strong carbonyl at 1700 (from the ester) and the conjugated double bond might show a peak around 1650. The O-H stretch isn't present in an ester, but the FTIR has a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an -OH group. Hmm, that's a problem because an ester doesn't have an -OH. So unless it's another group.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol with a double bond and a carbonyl. Or perhaps an alcohol and an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a hemiacetal or something with both an -OH and a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester (so O in the ester group), and another O in an -OH group, that would make two O's. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

But then, the IR would have a broad O-H peak (3000 cm⁻¹) and two carbonyl peaks. But an ester has only one carbonyl. Unless it's a different type of carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ortho ester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 peak is not a carbonyl. Maybe it's an aromatic ring. But without aromaticity, it's hard to have a peak there.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So a double bond is present, which would mean that the compound has a DoU of at least one. But considering the two carbonyl peaks, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups. So if it's an acid anhydride, which has two carbonyls. But that's less common.

Alternatively, perhaps a diketone. But the IR would have two carbonyl peaks, which might be around 1700 each, but maybe one is more intense.

Wait, but the two peaks are at 1700 and 1650, which could be two different carbonyl groups, like one ketone and one ester.

In that case, the molecular formula would have two O's from the ester and one O from the ketone? No, because the ester already contributes two O's. Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O, but wait, no. An ester is R-O-CO-R', so it has two O's in the ester group. So if the molecule has an ester and an alcohol group, that would be three O's, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize.

The key points:

1. FTIR: O-H (broad at 3000), two carbonyl peaks (1700 and 1650) → perhaps two different carbonyl groups or a conjugated carbonyl.

2. 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens → double bond present.

3. Mass spec: m/z=45 → possible fragment.

4. The formula must have at least two DoUs, so options B and C.

So, options B: C6H10O → DoU=2.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU=2.

If the compound has an -OH group (so O=1), and another carbonyl (O=1), but that's two O's, so formula would be O=2, which is option C.

Wait, but if the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the structure could be an ester with a conjugated double bond. But that would only have one carbonyl. So where would the two IR peaks come from?

Alternatively, maybe the structure has both an ester group (one carbonyl) and an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (another carbonyl). But that would require more O's, which would make the formula different.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal with a double bond. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of an ester group would explain the 1700 peak, and perhaps the 1650 peak is a conjugated double bond. So only one carbonyl, but the IR shows two. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 peak is an aromatic ring. If the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent, but that would require more DoU.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 1650 peak is an amide. But the problem doesn't mention any N, so probably not.

I'm getting stuck. Let's try to look at the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 could be from a specific group in the molecule.

If the formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of the molecular weight. Maybe it's a cleavage of the ester group.

The ester group is O-CO-O. So perhaps the fragment comes from the R-O- part. For example, if the molecule is an ester like R-O-CO-R', the fragment could be R-O- which would be (R-O)+. If R is CH2CH2CH3 (propan-2-yl), then CH2CH2CH2O would be (3 carbons, 6 H, 1 O), molecular weight=59. Not 45.

Alternatively, if R is methyl, then CH3O+ is 32. Not 45.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be from a ketene group. A ketene is R-C=O, and the ion could be R-C+=O. The molecular weight of a ketene fragment would be (R-C=O)+. For example, if R is CH2CH2, the fragment would be (CH2CH2CO)+, which is 59. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester's acyl group. For example, if the ester is CH2=CHCOO-R, the fragment could be CH2=CHCOO+, which would be (3 carbons, 3 O?), but molecular weight would be 73 (3*12 + (2*2 +1) + 3*16= 36 + 5 +48=89). No, that's not 45.

I think I'm stuck on the mass spec. Let me try to think differently.

Given that the IR has two carbonyls, which would require two oxygen atoms. So the formula must have O=2. That points to options A and C.

Options A: C6H12O2 → DoU=1.

If the compound has two carbonyls (two DoUs), then option A's DoU=1 is not enough. So option A can't be the answer.

Options C: C6H10O2 → DoU=2, which fits with two carbonyls.

So the formula is C6H10O2, option C.

But wait, does this fit with the mass spec?

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. The fragment is 45, so the rest is 69. 45 could be from a part of the molecule, like a CH2CH(O) group? Not sure, but perhaps the fragment is from a smaller part.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a methyl group and some oxygen. For example, CH3-O-CO- would have a molecular weight of 12+16+16=44. Close to 45. But not exact. Maybe including a hydrogen?

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone group. For example, if the molecule has a (CH3)2CO group (acetone), that's 58. But the fragment is 45.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be a propyl group with an oxygen. Propane-1-ol is C3H7OH, molecular weight 68. No, but 45 is 3×12 + something. Wait, 45= 12×3 + 3 → 39 → No. 12×2=24, 45-24=21. 21=16+5 → O and 5 H? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl ester group. CH3COO- is 60, but that's more than 45. Not helpful.

I'm not entirely confident, but considering the IR data and the DoU, the formula is likely C6H10O2, which is option C.


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group, and two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹, suggesting the presence of two carbonyl groups or a conjugated system. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is used to further deduce the molecular structure.

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates an O-H group.
   - The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of carbonyl groups, likely one ester or ketone and a conjugated system.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - The presence of vinyl hydrogens confirms a double bond, contributing to the degree of unsaturation (DoU).

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - The fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a specific fragment, possibly related to a methyl or ethyl group with oxygen.

4. **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - The compound must account for the double bond (1 DoU) and the carbonyl groups (1 DoU), giving a total of 2 DoUs.

5. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 1, which is insufficient to account for the two carbonyl groups.
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: DoU = 2, but this formula only accounts for one oxygen atom, inconsistent with the FTIR data showing two carbonyl groups.
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: DoU = 2, consistent with the presence of two carbonyl groups and an O-H group. This formula fits the FTIR and NMR data.
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: DoU = 1, insufficient to account for the two carbonyl groups.

6. **Mass Spectrometry Fragment**:
   - The fragment at m/z = 45 aligns with a possible fragment from a C₆H₁₀O₂ compound, such as a methyl or ethyl group with oxygen.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two carbonyl groups, an O-H group, and a double bond, consistent with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This matches the spectroscopic data and the degree of unsaturation.
