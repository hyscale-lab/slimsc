Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, okay, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. I think I need to approach this using Hess's Law or maybe the bond enthalpy method.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a molecule with multiple branches and double bonds. I'm going to count the number of each type of bond in this structure because the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies.

Wait, but wait! The enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using the standard bond energies of the reactants and products. The formula is: ΔHf° = Σ [ΔH of bonds broken] - Σ [ΔH of bonds formed]. But wait, no, I think it's the reverse. Oh right, it's the sum of bond energies of reactants minus the sum of bond energies of products. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. For the formation reaction, we form the molecule from its elements. So, the bonds are being formed in the product (the molecule) and broken in the reactants (elements). So, the formula should be: En
