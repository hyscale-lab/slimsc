Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think about each part.

The question says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm. I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, since the observed ratio decreases when spots are present. Wait, wait, when the star has spots, the Teff decreases. So the ratio of n1/n2 would change because temperature affects the exponential term.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So when Teff is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when it was 6000 K.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So that's (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

So let's model this using the Boltzmann equation. Let's assume that the transition is between two energy levels, with E2 > E1 because the photon emitted has a certain wavelength. Or wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near-infrared. Let me think, the energy difference ΔE would be E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So higher energy levels would correspond to higher E, but I think that's more about the photon's energy than the level
