Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star's effective temperature and how it affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The star has certain parameters when it's not covered by spots, and some when 40% of its surface is covered. The key point is that when the surface has spots, the overall Teff decreases, and the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels changes. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I remember that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, when the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K. But wait, the star's surface is partially covered by spots. 40% coverage, so 60% of the surface is normal. But the effective temperature given when spots are present is the overall, so I think it's an average. Maybe that affects the calculation. Wait, but the problem mentions the photospheric effective temperature, so perhaps the average is already taken into account. So for the purpose of the photosphere's temperature, when spots are present, it's 5500 K, and without spots, 6000 K.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2. The ratio is n1/n2. And when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when it has spots.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots. Because the ratio is higher without spots.

So the formula for the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Let me denote the ratio without spots as R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K.

With spots, the ratio becomes R' = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), where T2 is 5500 K.

The factor we're looking for is R / R' = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Simplify that: exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because T1 is larger than T2, since 6000 >5500. So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative. So the exponent will be negative, so the ratio R/R' = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, but wait, because T2 is lower, so E/(kT) is larger for T2. Wait, but let me proceed.

Wait, what's ΔE here? The energy difference between the two levels. The problem gives the wavelength of the transition as 1448 Å, which is about 1448 Angstroms. So that's in the UV range, I think. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Since the transition corresponds to that wavelength, ΔE
