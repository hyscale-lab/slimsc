Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound the spectral data corresponds to. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is the highest mass peak, so the molecular weight is 156. But wait, the m/z 158 peak could be something else. Maybe it's a fragment or an isotope. Let me thinkâ€”chlorine has an isotope at about 35Cl (about 75% abundance) and 37Cl (about 25%). So if the molecular formula includes a Cl atom, the molecular ion would have isotopic peaks. The molecular formula must have one Cl atom because 35Cl and 37Cl would cause peaks at m/z 156 and 158. Let me calculate the possible molecular formula.

The molecular weight is 156. If there's a Cl (atomic weight ~35.5), then the rest would be 156 - 35.5 = 120.5. What's 120.5? Let's see. Maybe it's C8H5O2 or something similar. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Hmm, but if we have Cl, maybe the formula is C6H5ClO2. Let's check: C is 12*6=72, H is 5=5, O is 16*2=32, Cl is 35.5. Total is 72+5+32+35.5 = 144.5. That's not 156. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate that: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32 = 156.5. Oh wait, that's approximately 156. So that makes sense. So the formula is likely C7H5ClO2.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks around 3500 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in carboxylic acids or alcohols. But a broad peak could also be from an alcohol or maybe even an amine, but that's less likely here. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 could be a carbonyl group. In carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700. But wait, in the case of carboxylic acids, the O-H is broad and strong. So if the IR shows a broad peak, that suggests maybe a carboxylic acid group. Alternatively, an aldehyde would have a peak around 2820 and 2720 (for the aldehyde C-H stretch), but the IR here doesn't mention those, so maybe not an aldehyde. Let me think: 1720 is more like an ester or possibly an acid chloride. Oh, wait, the options include phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid chloride. So phenyl chloroformate would have the structure OCl-CO-Ph. Its IR would show a strong peak for the carbonyl (maybe around 1760-1800 for acid chlorides). Hmm, but the IR here shows 1720, which is a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. But the broad peak in the IR suggests an O-H group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a very high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid O-H. But wait, in aldehydes, the proton is around 9-10 ppm, but a higher shift could happen if it's more deshielded, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid O-H is usually around 10-12 ppm, and as a singlet because it's exchanging and broad, but sometimes in DMSO it's a sharp peak. Wait, but in the NMR, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a single proton, like a phenolic O-H or an aldehyde. Wait, the description says it's a singlet. So for a carboxylic acid, the O-H would usually be a broad peak, but sometimes in D2O exchange conditions, it might appear as a singlet. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is a triplet or quartet, but in some cases, it could be a singlet if there's no coupling. Let me think: the 11 ppm is more likely to be a carboxylic acid O-H. Because aldehydes are usually a bit lower (like 9-10 ppm), but if it's a strong deshielding effect, maybe higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenolic O-H, but that would be less likely to be at 11 ppm, more like 5-7 ppm unless it's strongly deshielded.

Then, the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These look like aromatic protons. The splitting suggests a para-substituted benzene ring because the protons are in doublets with two each. So
