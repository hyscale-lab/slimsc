Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given. We need to find out which of the options is compound X.

Wait, wait. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane rings a bell. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Swern oxidation. Swern oxidation is used to oxidize alcohols to ketones or aldehydes, right? So if compound X is reacting with this reagent, it probably has an alcohol group. So the product would be an oxidized form, like a ketone or aldehyde.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at the product's NMR data. So the 1H NMR has several signals: two singlets (each 3H, s) at 2.28 and 2.31. Hmm, that's two methyl groups. Then, the aromatic signals: a doublet at 6.75, then 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That seems like a pattern of a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe with some coupling.

The 13C NMR shows a carbonyl carbon at 197.7, which is typical for a ketone or aldehyde. Oh wait, but aldehydes are usually around 190-200, and ketones around 205-225? Wait, no, maybe I got that reversed. Let me think. No, wait, in 13C NMR, carbonyl carbons like ketones are usually around 205-220 ppm. Aldehydes are a bit lower, like 190-205. So a carbonyl at 197.7 would be more like an aldehyde, but wait, sometimes ketones can be lower. Hmm, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR data: the carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4, which are probably CH3 groups. Then, there's a bunch of carbons in the aromatic region: 126.9 (two C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (two C), 130.3 (1C), and then 141.5 and 144.1, which are probably quaternary carbons in the aromatic ring.

So putting that together, maybe the product is an epoxide that's been opened up or something? Wait, no, because the reaction is Swern oxidation. Oh wait, no, Swern oxidation is for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or al
